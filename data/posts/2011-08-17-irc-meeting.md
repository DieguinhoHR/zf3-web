 The Zend Framework community is having the first of its bi-weekly IRC meetings this coming Wednesday, 17 August 2011, at 17:00 UTC. Find out what we'll discuss, and how you can participate.

 The meeting will be held on Freenode IRC, in a new channel "#zf2-meeting". As this is the first meeting, we'll be primarily discussing the structure of future meetings, as well as process and milestones for ZF2.

 This first meeting's agenda is located at:

 <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-08-17+Meeting+Agenda> Those with the rights to edit pages in the wiki can add to the agenda; be warned, however, that the idea is to keep the topics timeboxed to ensure that the essentials are covered, decisions are made, and actionable items discovered and assigned.

 Following the meeting, we will post the transcript, and link to it via this blog, along with a summary.
