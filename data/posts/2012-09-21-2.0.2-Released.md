 The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Zend Framework 2.0.2! Packages and installation instructions are available at:

- [http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest](/downloads/latest)

 This release fixes an issue in the "Router" service that was affecting URL generation, among other things.

<!--more-->

 Specifically, for the 2.0.1 release, a change was made to allow URL generation to continue to work even under a Console paradigm. However, this change apparently caused URL generation to break in a number of situations when in an HTTP paradigm. A fix was put into place, and integration tests created, to ensure this works going forward.
