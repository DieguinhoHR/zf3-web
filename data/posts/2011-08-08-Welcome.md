 Welcome to the new Zend Framework development blog!

 This blog is a new effort by the Zend Framework team to keep the ZF community abreast of development as we work towards version 2.0 and beyond.

<!--more-->

 In the coming days and weeks, we will be posting updates, including:

- Weekly status of Zend's ZF team as they work on ZF2.
- Links to new MVC (and other) prototypes for developers to examine, test, and ultimately provide feedback on.
- Announcements of new developer snapshot releases.
- Documentation and examples for newly written or refactored components.
- Links and summaries of blog posts covering ZF2 development and usage.

 Most communication is currently taking place on the [zf-contributors mailing list](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/ZF-Contributor-f680267.html), and we encourage you to subscribe to that list in order to follow discussions; a link for subscribing is provided in the sidebar.

 You can follow the blog using our [RSS2 feed](/zf2/blog/feed).
