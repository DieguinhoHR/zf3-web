Today, we released [zend-db 2.9.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/releases/tag/release-2.9.0)!
This is our first new feature release in over 18 months, and contains
7 bug fixes, 6 new features, numerous unit test additions, and many
documentation improvements.

**zend-db** is an important component of many PHP projects, and we know that its
support is crucial for many people. As such, we allocated a number of weeks to
triaging the various open issues and patches (more than 50) to ensure we would
provide a stable release.

The release contains the following changes:

### Added

- [#216](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/216) added `AFTER` support
  in `ALTER TABLE` syntax for MySQL.
- [#223](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/223) added support for
  empty values set with the `IN` predicate.
- [#271](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/271) added support for
  dash characters in MySQL identifiers.
- [#273](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/273) added support for
  implementing an error handler when used with `db2_prepare`.
- [#275](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/275) added support for
  `LIMIT OFFSET` for db2.
- [#280](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/280) added the `version`
  DSN parameter for the pdo_dblib extension.

### Fixed

- [#205](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/205) fixes whitespace
  issues in `ORDER BY` syntax.
- [#224](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/224) fixes how parameters
  are bound to statements in the PDO adapter. PDO has a restriction on parameter
  names of `[0-9a-zA_Z_]`; as such, the driver now hashes the parameter names
  using `md5()` in order to ensure compatibility with other drivers.
- [#229](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/229) fixes SSL support
  in the mysqli adapter.
- [#255](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/255) fixes an edge case
  when using `ResultSet` with array values (versus objects).
- [#261](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/261) fixes how the
  Firebird adapter attempts to retrieve the last generated value so as to
  prevent exceptions being raised.
- [#276](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/276) and
  [#287](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/287) provide fixes to
  enable usage of the component with PHP 7.2.

We also dropped support for PHP 5.5 (EOL last year) and HHVM; zend-db 2.9 and
above now only support PHP 5.6 and PHP 7+ releases.

## Future of zend-db

We are planning a 3.0 release of zend-db release sometime in 2018. This new major version
will contain new features sucha as extended [DDL support](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/pull/231)
for different database vendors (currently, most support targets MySQL), and support
for [SEQUENCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sequence-numbers/sequence-numbers).
Additionally, that release will drop support for PHP versions older than 7.1.
