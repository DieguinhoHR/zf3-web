The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability of [Expressive](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/) 1.0.0 STABLE!

You can install it using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), via the `create-project` command:

```bash
$ composer create-project zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton expressive
```

If you were using a release candidate, you can update your existing applications using:

```bash
$ composer require "zendframework/zend-expressive:^1.0"
```

What's new in the stable version?
---------------------------------

Nothing!

Well, not "nothing". Since last week, we merged a few documentation fixes, but, more importantly, finalized our documentation. This included a few changes:

- Some re-organization, to better categorize the documentation hierarchy.
- Switching from [bookdown](http://bookdown.io) to [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) as our build engine of choice. We'd already been using MkDocs to publish on [ReadTheDocs](http://rtfd.org), so this wasn't a huge change. The choice was made based on stability, maturity, and ecosystem; MkDocs has been around for quite some time, and enabled us to accomplish a number of ideas quite quickly.
- Automated publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), via Travis-CI. Any time we push to our master branch, the documentation will be updated.

We're quite proud of [the results](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/), and hope that the new documentation serves our users well.

What's to look forward to?
--------------------------

Shipping a stable version means that you can depend on the API going forward. As such, we're messaging that it's production ready; start building and shipping your applications on it today!

For the next feature version, we already have a few things scheduled:

- Removal of the deprecated `pre_routing`/`post_routing` configuration support, as messaged in the [migration documentation](http://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/reference/migration/rc-to-v1/#timeline-for-migration).
- Providing [modular functionality](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/31) by default (with opt-out). This will likely include also providing a solution similar to the [component installer](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-component-installer) to aid with auto-registering installed packages.

[We](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-router/graphs/contributors) [wish](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-aurarouter/graphs/contributors) [to](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-fastroute/graphs/contributors) [thank](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/graphs/contributors) [everyone](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-template/graphs/contributors) [who](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-platesrenderer/graphs/contributors) [contributed](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/graphs/contributors) [to](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer/graphs/contributors) [the](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers/graphs/contributors) [Expressive](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive/graphs/contributors) [project](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/graphs/contributors)! (That previous sentence is a link for every one of our 11 Expressive repositories!)

Additionally, we thank everyone who has provided us feedback — whether in the form of questions, bug reports, or suggestions — these past few months; without the critical feedback, the project would not be where it is today.

A few folks stand out:

- [Enrico Zimuel](http://www.zimuel.it), who started it all!
- [Geert Eltink](https://xtreamwayz.com), who did the hard work of making the installer work!
- [Hari K T](http://harikt.com), who nudged us to split the repository into discrete, single-purpose projects!
- [Michael Moussa](https://github.com/michaelmoussa), who suggested the idea that middleware specifications could be pipelines themselves — and then implemented the solution!

Write your next project Expressively!
