Per our [previous ZF3 update](/blog/zend-framework-3-update-and-roadmap.html), this is the first in an ongoing series of bi-weekly posts on ZF3 development status.

The highlights:

- >80 pull requests merged
- 28 releases of components
- 9 components updated to zend-servicemanager/zend-eventmanager v3 changes
- 2 release candidates of expressive

Pull request activity

Activity has been quite high the past couple weeks, with [more than 80 pull requests merged](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:pr+org:zendframework+is:merged+closed:%3E=2015-11-24+) (link requires a GitHub account). Many of these were related to the Expressive release candidates (more on those later), but more than half were on ZF components, and ranged from bugfixes to new features to ZF3-specific refactors.

Component Releases
------------------

We released the following components and versions since the last update. While not all releases are related to ZF3 specifically, this list is intended to detail activity within the organization. One goal of splitting the various components was to increase release velocity; we're definitely seeing that happen!

- [zend-diactoros 1.2.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros/releases/tag/1.2.0), which adds a `TextResponse` and `CallbackStream`, updates the `SapiEmitter` to emit a `Content-Length` header by default, and ensures the default charset of an `HtmlResposne` is utf-8.
- [zend-code 2.6.1](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-code/releases/tag/release-2.6.1), which replaces the doctrine/common dependency with the more specific doctrine/annotations.
- [zend-expressive-template](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-template), a new component containing the `TemplateRendererInterface` and related value objects used by Expressive; this allows developers to use the interface in non-Expressive applications.
- [zend-expressive-router](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-router), a new component containing the `RouterInterface` and related value objects used by Expressive; this allows developers to use the interface in non-Expressive applications.
- [zend-expressive-aurarouter 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-aurarouter/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0 was also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-router instead of Expressive, and is considered stable.
- [zend-expressive-fastroute 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-fastroute/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0 was also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-router instead of Expressive, and is considered stable.
- [zend-expressive-zendrouter 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendrouter/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0 was also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-router instead of Expressive, and is considered stable.
- [zend-expressive-platesrenderer 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-platesrenderer/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0 was also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-template instead of Expressive, and is considered stable.
- [zend-expressive-twigrenderer 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0 and 0.3.1 were also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-template instead of Expressive, and is considered stable. Additionally, the component now has a new configuration structure.
- [zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer 1.0.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer/releases/tag/1.0.0) (0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.4.0, and 0.4.1 were also released); the component now depends on zend-expressive-template instead of Expressive, and is considered stable. Additionally, the component now has custom `url` and `serverUrl` helpers that work with zend-expressive-router and PSR-7, respectively.
- [zend-feed 2.6.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-feed/releases/tag/release-2.6.0) provides improvements that reduce dependencies, and allow better interoperability with other HTTP clients; including PSR-7-based clients.
- [zend-expressive-helpers](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers), a new component that provides helpers for generating URI paths from configured routes, and fully-qualified URIs based on the current request URI.
- [zend-test 2.5.2](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/releases/tag/release-2.5.2) adds support for writing tests to use PHPUnit 5.
- [zend-eventmanager 2.6.1](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/releases/tag/release-2.6.1) updates the dependencies to make Athletic a development-only dependency.
- [zend-db 2.6.2](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-db/releases/tag/release-2.6.2) provides a number of bugfixes
- ZendService\_Apple\_Apns [1.1.2](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Apple_Apns/releases/tag/release-1.1.2) and [1.2.0](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Apple_Apns/releases/tag/release-1.2.0), providing a bugfix and Safari push support, respectively.

ZF3 Refactors

Expressive Release Candidates
-----------------------------

This week, we've issued two release candidates of Expressive, with RC4 being the latest. Be sure to read the [RC3](/blog/expressive-1-0-0rc3-released.html) and [RC4](/blog/expressive-1-0-0rc4-released.html) announcements to find out what changes have been made; a lot of work has occurred in the past few weeks!

Until next time
---------------

We'll be providing another update on either 22 or 23 December 2015 (based on holiday vacation schedules).

Until then, if you want to help:

- There are still [component refactors to complete or review](https://github.com/zendframework/maintainers/wiki/ZF3-code-refactoring).
- We're still looking for feedback on [reducing zend-mvc dependencies](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc/issues/46) and [identifying core components for the zf2 repository](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/7646).
- Test Expressive, and help us reach a stable release of this new feature!

Many thanks to all the contributors who have provided feedback, patches, reviews, or releases!
