End of Life
-----------

[As announced previously](/blog/2016-06-28-zf1-eol.html), Zend Framework 1 will
reach its end of life on 28 September 2016, and only receive security fixes
between now and that date. Past that point, we will offer custom bug
and security fixes for Zend Framework 1 on-demand only to
[Enterprise users of Zend Server](http://www.zend.com/en/support-center/support/production-sla).

Thank You!
