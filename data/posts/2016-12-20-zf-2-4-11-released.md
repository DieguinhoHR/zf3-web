The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability

This is a [Long Term Support](/long-term-support/) release.

## Security Fix

This release contains a fix for a potential remote code execution vulnerability
when using the `Zend\Mail\Transport\Sendmail` transport adapter. Prior to this
release, a maliciously crafted local address portion of a `From` address could
potentially inject arguments to the system `sendmail` binary. This release
provides detection of such addresses, and prevents attempts to send them.

For more information, please read [the ZF2016-04 advisory](/security/advisory/ZF2016-04).

The patch is provided against:

- Zend Framework 2.4.11
- zend-mail 2.4.11 and 2.7.2

Zend Framework 2.5 and 3.0 users who update via Composer will receive the
zend-mail 2.7.2 version.

## Long Term Support

As a reminder, the 2.4 series is our current Long Term Support release, and will
receive security and critical bug fixes until 31 March 2018.

You can opt-in to the LTS version by pinning your `zendframework/zendframework`
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) requirement to the version `~2.4.0`.
