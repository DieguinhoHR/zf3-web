Changes in RC3
--------------

RC3 shows a number of improvements, including a number of _new components_ created in order to improve interoperability with other [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) middleware solutions.

### New Components

First, we split our routing and templating subcomponents into their own repositories and packages:

- [zendframework/zend-expressive-router](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-router)
- [zendframework/zend-expressive-template](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-template)

These contain the code that was originally in `Zend\Expressive\Router` and `Zend\Expressive\Template` (with some additions; see below), and the subcomponents were removed from the Expressive tree entirely. Expressive now _depends_ on these packages. _This separation allows users of other PSR-7 middleware stacks to use the routing and templating interfaces, as well as their implementations, within their chosen stack._

Next, we created a new package, [zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers). This package contains utility classes and middleware useful to Expressive, but which could be useful to other PSR-7 frameworks as well:

- `Zend\Expressive\Helper\ServerUrlHelper` provides a class for generating fully-qualified URIs based on the current request. When you provide a path to the helper, that path will be resolved based on the current request scheme and target. This helper depends on dedicated middleware to seed it with the current request, which is also provided in the package.
- `Zend\Expressive\Helper\UrlHelper` provides a class for generating URI paths based on the current `RouterInterface` instance present, delegating to its `generateUri()` method. It also has awareness of the matched `RouteResult` (more on that later), allowing you to generate "self" URIs, as well as URIs with partial parameters based on the currently matched route.

You can read about the new helpers [in the documentation](http://zend-expressive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/helpers/intro/).

Fixes and Improvements
----------------------

### RouteResult observers

In order to provide the functionality in `Zend\Expressive\Helper\UrlHelper`, we needed a way to inform classes of the routing results. To accomplish this, we added the following to the zend-expressive-router package:

- `Zend\Expressive\Router\RouteResultSubjectInterface`, which defines a class that will obtain a `RouteResult` and notify observers; and
- `Zend\Expressive\Router\RouteResultObserverInterface`, which defines a class that will be updated with a `RouteResult`.

`Zend\Expressive\Application` now implements the `RouteResultSubjectInterface`, and `UrlHelper` is an example of an observer.

The documentation [now contains information on route result observers](http://zend-expressive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/router/result-observers/), should you want more details on the feature.

A small number of fixes and improvements were also made during the RC3 lifecycle.

### Create Middleware Pipelines

[Michael Moussa](https://github.com/michaelmoussa) provided a feature to allow specifying not just concrete middleware, but _arrays_ of middleware both when creating routed middleware as well as when adding middleware to the pre/post\_routing middleware pipelines.

To illustrate:

```php
// Manually, for pipeline middleware:
$app->pipe('/api', [
    'Authentication',
    'Authorization',
    'ContentNegotiation',
    'Validation',
    'Resource',
]);

// Manually, for routed middleware:
$app->get('/api/resource[/{id:\d+}]', [
    'Authentication',
    'Authorization',
    'ContentNegotiation',
    'Validation',
    'Resource',
]);

// Via configuration, for pipeline middleware:
return [
    'middleware_pipeline' => [
        'pre_routing' => [
            [
                'path' => '/api',
                'middleware' => [
                    'Authentication',
                    'Authorization',
                    'ContentNegotiation',
                    'Validation',
                    'Resource',
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

// Via configuration, for routed middleware:
return [
    'routes' => [
        [
            'name' => 'api',
            'path' => '/api',
            'middleware' => [
                'Authentication',
                'Authorization',
                'ContentNegotiation',
                'Validation',
                'Resource',
            ],
            'allowed_method' => ['GET'],
        ],
    ],
];
```

In each case, any individual middleware in the list may be a callable middleware, or the name of a service that resolves as middleware.

This feature should allow creating unique, complex middleware pipelines based on specific routes a snap!

### Casting view models to arrays

One feature users of zend-view wanted was the ability to pass `ViewModel` instances to a renderer. Prior to RC3, if you provided a view model, normalization would destroy any variables stored in the view model due to improper casting. This has now been resolved.

### Get the Full RouteResult

The full `RouteResult` is now injected into the request as the attribute `Zend\Expressive\Router\RouteResult`.

### Fewer Silent Failures

A contributor provided [a patch](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive/pull/197) that improves the `ApplicationFactory` by raising exceptions when key services are missing, instead of silently ignoring them. While this is a small backwards compatibility break, it provides important information that previously led to hard-to-debug issues.

### Twig improvements

The [zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer) package now allows you to register custom extensions. See the [0.3.0 changelog for details](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/releases/tag/0.3.0) (which is the first version introducing this capability).

### zend-view improvements

The [zendframework/zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer) package had a number of usability updates:

- It now adds the zendframework/zend-i18n package as a dependency, as it's a requirement of the PhpRenderer.
- It now provides concrete `ServerUrlHelper` and `UrlHelper` helper classes, as wrappers around the zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers equivalents. This change allowed reducing dependencies, and now allows the package to be used without Expressive.
- It now provides a factory for the `HelperPluginManager`, allowing you to provide your own instance, and thus custom helpers.

### Document Creating Custom 404 Handlers

[Abdul Malik Ikhsan](https://github.com/samsonasik) provided documentation covering how to create a custom 404 handler for your application for logic such as logging. You [can read it in the cookbook](http://zend-expressive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cookbook/#how-can-i-set-custom-404-page-handling).

Upgrading
---------

If you're already using Expressive, you'll want to upgrade! To do so, you'll need to make a few changes to your application.

### Dependency updates

- Update `zendframework/zend-expressive` to `~1.0.0@rc || ^1.0`. This will also make it easier to upgrade to the stable version when it comes out.
- Update any `zendframework/zend-expressive-*` components to `^1.0`. These include your chosen router and template system (if any).
- Potentially add `zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers` (at `^1.1`), if you plan to use the `UrlHelper` or `ServerUrlHelper`. (If you're using the zend-view renderer, you'll already be getting this dependency.)

### Configuration changes

The only configuration changes necessary are if you want to use the new helpers. If you won't be, and you're not using zend-view, you can skip this section.

First, add service entries for each to `config/autoload/dependencies.global.php`:

```php
use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'invokables' => [
            Helper\ServerUrlHelper::class => Helper\ServerUrlHelper::class,
            /* ... */
        ],
        'factories' => [
            Helper\UrlHelper::class => Helper\UrlHelperFactory::class,
            /* ... */
        ],
    ],
];
```

Next, you'll need to add the `ServerUrlMiddleware` to the midddleware pipeline. Edit `config/autoload/middleware-pipeline.global.php` as follows:

```php
use Zend\Expressive\Helper;

return [
    // This section will likely be new:
    'dependencies' => [
        'factories' => [
            Helper\ServerUrlMiddleware::class => Helper\ServerUrlMiddlewareFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
    // This section existed, but needs edits:
    'middleware_pipeline' => [
        'pre_routing' => [
            // Add the following:
            [ 'middleware' => ServerUrlMiddleware::class ],
            /* ... */
        ],
        'post_routing' => [
            /* ... */
        ],
    ],
];
```

Once these changes are made, your application should now be ready to use the helpers.

Future
------

We're very excited about this release! Thanks to a large number of testers and users, we've been able to refine the offering, and improve our ability to interoperate in the PSR-7 ecosystem. We feel this version provides a nice sweet spot for the initial stable features, and anticipate a stable release in the next couple weeks.

If you are testing Expressive — whether for the first time, or updating an existing application — please help us polish the release and get it ready for general availability!
