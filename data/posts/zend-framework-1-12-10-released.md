Incremental improvements
------------------------

 Zend Framework 1.12 is in maintenance mode, but that has not slowed activity on the repository; this release features almost 40 bugfixes! Among other changes, contributors have also provided improvements for our build process, including the removal of tests and documentation when adding ZF1 to your project via Composer.

Thank You!
----------

 As usual, thanks go out to all contributors to this version; Zend Framework 1's stability and robustness is due to your efforts. I also want to thank [Rob Allen](http://akrabat.com) and [Frank Br√ºckner](https://github.com/froschdesign) for shepherding along contributions and acting as release managers!
