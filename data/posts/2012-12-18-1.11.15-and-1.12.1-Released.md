Security Announcement
---------------------

 These releases are security releases, and contain fixes to both the `Zend_Feed_Rss` and `Zend_Feed_Atom` classes. If you are using either, and particularly if you are instantiating them directly (instead of via `Zend_Feed::import()`)we recommend upgrading immediately. For more information, please read the [ZF2012-05 advisory details](/security/advisory/ZF2012-05). Thanks goes to Yury Dyachenko at Positive Research Center for alerting us of the issues and working with us on appropriate fixes.

Thank You!

 Many thanks to all contributors to this release!
