 Today we held the first Zend Framework community IRC meeting. Find out what we discussed, and where you can read the transcript.

 The meeting was held on Freenode IRC in the #zf2-meeting channel, and moderated by Pieter Kokx. While sometimes boisterous, sometimes off-topic, it definitely helped build some community spirit as well as consensus surrounding the direction of ZF2.

 Specifically, we discussed:

- Format of meetings and how agendas will be created.
- The proposal process.
- Milestones towards ZF2's completion.

 The full transcript, as well as a summary of decisions, can be found on the [ZF2 wiki](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-08-17+Meeting+Log).
