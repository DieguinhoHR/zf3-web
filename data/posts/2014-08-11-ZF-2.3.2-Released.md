Notable Changes
---------------

 The following changes are noted as being fixes that may have potential implications for existing applications.

- [\#6295](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/6295) introduces a slight change to how Zend\\Form\\Fieldset handles disabled values. Previously, they were represented in the form, and still processed on submit, which allowed the possibility of changing the value. This pull request modifies the behavior to extract the original value from any bound data if present and use that value instead, which is the correct behavior.
- [\#6423](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/6423) modifies the behavior of Zend\\Validator\\File\\UploadFile to only return the FILE\_NOT\_FOUND error if upload was successful; previously, it incorrectly would report this error even if an error occurred during upload.
