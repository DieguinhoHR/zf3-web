For many years, we've had requests for dedicated Zend Framework forums. We've
resisted doing so, and instead deferred to using mailing lists and Stack
Overflow tags. However, these are imperfect: searching for questions and answers
is often difficult if not impossible.

In the past few years, [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) has proved itself
as a community-centric forum solution. Further, they have started offering
free hosting for open source communities, making it a compelling option to
consider.

We recently reached out to them, and they have agreed to host the Zend Framework
forums for us.

So, please join us on the [Zend Framework Discourse Forums](https://discourse.zendframework.com)!

You may sign up with any Google, GitHub, or Twitter account, or register
directly with the site.

Some pages of interest:

- [Zend Framework Components Questions](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/questions/components) (including zend-mvc applications)
- [Expressive Questions](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/questions/expressive)
- [Apigility Questions](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/questions/apigility)

Additionally, we have setup a section for
[contributors](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/contributors) to discuss
architecture, milestones, etc.

Welcome all, and we look forward to your conversations!
