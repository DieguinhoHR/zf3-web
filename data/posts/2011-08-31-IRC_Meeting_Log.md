 Today we held our second Zend Framework community IRC meeting. Find out what we discussed, and where you can read the transcript.

 The meeting was held on Freenode IRC in the #zf2-meeting channel, and moderated by Pieter Kokx. The meeting ran long (15 minutes over), had several heated exchanges, but gained general consensus on a variety of topics.

 Specifically, we discussed:

- Modules - defining what "module" means, and differentiating it from "component", as well as defining these terms in relation to "library" and "application".
- Distribution categories - what broad categories we'll define as "buckets" for components, and which categories will be considered necessary for the "standard distribution" -- which defines what needs to be done to be considered stable.
- Timeframes for potential releases.

 The full transcript, as well as a summary of decisions, can be found on the [ZF2 wiki](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/2011-08-31+Meeting+Log).
