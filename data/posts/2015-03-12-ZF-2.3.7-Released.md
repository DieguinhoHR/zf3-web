 The Zend Framework community is pleased to announce the immediate availability of:

- Zend Framework **2.3.7**

- [http://framework.zend.com/downloads/latest](/downloads/latest)

Fixes
-----

 Zend Framework 2.3.6 released a change against Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractRestfulController that was originally intended for the upcoming 2.4.0 release, and which introduces a slight backwards compatibility (BC) break. 2.3.7 reverts the change to keep BC in the 2.3 series.

Milestones
----------

 We are currently actively finishing the final features for Zend Framework 2.4, and plan a release candidate for next week (week of 17 March 2015). Once 2.4 stable is released, we turn towards Zend Framework 3 tasks, as outlined in [ the Zend Framework 3 roadmap](/blog/announcing-the-zend-framework-3-roadmap.html).
