This coming 15 March 2017, at 20:00 CET, [Gary Hockin](https://twitter.com/GeeH)
will present the talk "Zend Framework Done Right" for [Nomad
PHP](https://nomadphp.com/zend-framework-done-right/). From the talk synopsis:

> While the upgrade path from ZF2 to ZF3 is nowhere near as complicated as from
> ZF1 to ZF2, there are still plenty of things the prepared developer needs to
> know to make upgrading as seamless as possible.
> 
> In this session, we’ll cover the backwards compatibility breaks, and which
> parts of your application you’ll need to rewrite, but also the forward facing
> changes that are in ZF2 right now that allow you to make many of your changes
> before you even upgrade to ZF3.

We encourage ZF developers of all skill levels to check out the talk!
