Over the years, we've had a number of different channels for the Zend Framework
community to use:

- A mailing list
- JIRA and Confluence
- IRC channels
- GitHub (issues, pull requests, wikis)
- Trello (planning)
- Twitter (announcements)
- Blog (announcements, articles, tutorials)

Each has had its merits, and each has its problems, ranging from discoverability
to usability.

As such, we've been re-evaluating what we're doing, and focusing on how to
better engage with the community, but also allow community members to better
engage amongst each other.

We're now announcing the first two changes!

## Newsletter

We now have a contributor newsletter in place, where we will:

- Announce new releases of ZF, Expressive, and Apigility components.
- Provide summaries of related blog posts we discover.
- Announce roadmaps, where we'll also provide avenues for feedback.
- Provide avenues for community engagement.

If you are interested:

- [Read the archives](http://tinyletter.com/mwopzend/archive)

The newsletter will replace our zf-announce mailing list entirely (which we have
not been updating for around a year anyways), and provide more insight into what
is going on in the community as a whole.

## Slack

We love IRC. However, we recognize that it's not always user-friendly, and that
despite best intentions, we sometimes need to moderate discussions. We've looked
at a number of alternate options, including:

- Gitter
- Hipchat
- Slack

We decided upon Slack for a number of reasons:

- Easy signup and onboarding process.
- Channels are not tied to repositories (this was key; we didn't want to
  overwhelm users by making them figure out exactly which discussion to join!)
- Moderation tools available.
- Number of integrations available.
- Familiarity within the ecosystem.

We've been quietly testing it for a couple of weeks, by first bringing in our
community review team, and then contributors. We're now opening it for general
signups:

- [Receive a ZF Slack invite](https://zendframework-slack.herokuapp.com)

Slack will replace IRC for both user and contributor discussions. If you are an
IRC die-hard, we have enabled the Slack &lt;-&gt; IRC bridge, which you can get
information on after you have signed up for Slack.

## Twitter

We've had the [zfdevteam twitter account](https://twitter.com/zfdevteam) for
several years. This past month, however, we've put a number of processes and
integrations in place to ensure you get information on:

- the latest releases
- recent blog posts
- ZF/Expressive/Apigility-related events

If you're not following zfdevteam yet, start following now!

## More to come!

We have a few more initiatives in the works, and hope to announce them soon!
Keep an eye on this space for announcements (or in the #news channel on Slack!)!
