ZF-4364: Using SkipData info to improve search performance
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Sub-task Created: 2008-09-23T10:48:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-04T13:36:27.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.7.0 (17/Nov/08)

### Description

Each term within an index has a list of matched documents. This list may be large enough and it may take a long time to load it.

This list also has some additional subindex known as "skip data". This info allows to check directly if some document matches specified term.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene should use skipData to optimize search performance.

That may be done by reordering of subsearches execution.

I believe this was implemented for 1.7. If not, please reopen, Alex.
