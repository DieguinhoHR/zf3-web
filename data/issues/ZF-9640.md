### Description

Write remote object call in flex4 for php server using zend-amf. The database used is MYSQL and sql file is attached. column collation used is latin2\_general\_ci for all the columns. Write a php as attached. make a call to getAllReviews() The byte[] for response amf message is attahced.This is not correct AMF format due to which AMFDeserializer fails to deserialize amf message. Attached is the byte[] came as amf response. Pass it to deserializer it throws UTFFormatException. I am using blazeDs (flex.messaging) AMFDeserializer.

The same call works fine with amfphp without any complaints from deserializer.
