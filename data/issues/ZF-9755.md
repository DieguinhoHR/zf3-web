### Description

It is currently written in php 5.3, but could be downgraded if necessary. Mostly its almost direct port of Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Activemq, with better test coverage and lazy connection. It also features a 'no-local' header, which lets client to receive messages only sent from other location more here (<http://stomp.codehaus.org/Stomp+JMS>). The source and unit tests can be found here <http://github.com/avalanche123/PHP-Stomp-Queue>. Feedback is much appreciated Thanks
