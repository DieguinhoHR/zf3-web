ZF-7823: Prioritize Messages
----------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-09-10T09:30:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:23.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

I'm using Zend\_Queue as an emailer through a cron job and would like to be able to set the priority of the message that are being received and sent to the queue. For my specific situation I would want to classify registration validation emails, auction outbid notifications etc as of higher importance then newsletter / comment notifications etc.

I'm sure priority messaging could be utilized in a number of other scenarios as well.

Cheers,

Jay

The adapters don't support this natively. You'd be better off extending the Db class and modifying the table schema to include a priority column then adjusting the queries to pull back the higher priority messages first.

That is what I'm currently doing, just wasn't sure if there was a way to add support for it. Not familiar with the other adapters.

Priority and dependency are also both of my need on DB

I tell to work on it.
