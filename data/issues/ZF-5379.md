I remove all unnecessary require\_once and apply a lazy-loading

See [[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2456?focusedCommentId=18717#action_18717%7Ccomment)] on the [ZF-2456] issue.

Analysers don't require lazy loading (possible performance improvement doesn't comparable with index operations time) and in the same time current implementation gives the possibility to "turn on" all existing analyzers by one require once - require\_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php' or require\_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php'

On the other hand that should be described in the documentation, so I've just created another issue for this - [ZF-5717].

I understand well but the loading is realized by a script which analyses the code, thus some files could be load before 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php'. BTW, I think it's not a good thing that we obtain 'Fatal error' when we wanted to load a particular file.

Problem is resolved.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't use any special require\_once policy now.
