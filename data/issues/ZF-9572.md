### Description

Following situation:

There are two password fields in the form: password and confirm\_password. both are not required, as the user only needs to enter the password and it's confirmation if he wan'ts to change it. the password\_confirmation element has a context-validator added which is not used when you don't enter any value for the confirmation.

 
        // Password
        $this->addElement('password', 'password')
            ->setLabel('Change password')
            ->setAttrib('autocomplete', 'off')
            ->setAttrib('tabindex', 19);
    
        // Password confirmation
        $confirmPass = new I22_Validate_Context($this);
        $confirmPass->addContextElement('password');
        $confirmPass->setMessage('The confirmation does not match the password.');
    
        $this->addElement('password', 'password_confirmation')
            ->setLabel('Confirm new password')
            ->setAttrib('tabindex', 20)
            ->setAttrib('autocomplete', 'off')
            ->addValidator($confirmPass);


So it would be great if the following could be added

Zend\_Form\_Element\_Instance->setValidateIfEmpty($bool);

and make Zend\_Form\_Element\_Instance->isValid($value); also run the validators if the value is empty but the flag is set to true.

I'll do it myself when I have my conributor account. but for now I just solved it by using an overloaded isValid method on the form containing teh pasword confirmation.

Do you know about $form->getElement('password')->setRequired($bool); And $form->getElement('password')->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator($bool);

$form->password->setRequired(false); $form->password\_confirmation->setRequired(true)->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator(false);

within I22\_Validate\_Context

if (!empty($this->getContextElement()->getValue())) { // Validate }

ah now I see the real problem: the form element already has a notEmpty validator set as I use the same form for registration and user settings. i'm now just doing

$form->getElement('password') ->setRequired(false); $form->getElement('password\_confirmation') ->removeValidator('notEmpty') ->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator(false);

thanks for your time ;)
