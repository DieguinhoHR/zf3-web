### Description

Currently the full file data need to be passed to putObject(), and can cause problems with PHP's memory limit with large files.

Specifying a file name or PHP steam from which the data is gradually copied (without putting it into a PHP string) when the HTTP request is actually made would be better. This most likely requires changes in Zend\_HTTP\_Client and its adapters as well. As for the Socket adapter, using stream\_copy\_to\_stream() works perfect.

Slightly related to some elements of the comments on ZF-3758

I am not familiar with S3 APi, but does this not work with the cURL adapter?

The PHP curl extensiion is not available on all PHP environments, so that is not a general solution.

Needs ZF-6736 for streaming, I'll take care of it.

Fixed in trunk, now S3 supports streaming in upload and download.
