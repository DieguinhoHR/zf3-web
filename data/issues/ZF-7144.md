### Description

Hi,

I would like to join my voice on <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3701> and add that it's still hard to extend some pdf classes. Well it's not hard to create a new subclass (parent properties are protected, no longer private), anyway it's extremely hard to incorporate our subclass in Zend\_Pdf normal behaviour without having to rewrite the entire class.

For instance I wanted to subclass Zend\_Pdf\_Page to add extra methods such as drawTextOnRight(), drawTextOnCenter(), getTextWidth()... and the problem is that default Zend\_Pdf\_Page is hard-coded within Zend\_Pdf => Zend\_Pdf::load() will return a pdf with all pages being instances of Zend\_Pdf\_Page and not of my subclass.

It would be really nice if Zend\_Pdf used same mechanism as used by Zend\_Db, ie. to store name of used pdf classes (Zend\_Pdf\_Page, Zend\_Font...) as protected properties (ex: Zend\_Db\_Table::$\_rowClass). That way we could easily subclass and fully customize our own version of Zend\_Pdf and other pdf classes.

Regards, Remy

I think this issue should be postponed till 2.0 due to backwards compatibility (sigh...)

I might miss the point but I don't see backwards incompatibility.

just create a Zend\_Pdf::$\_pageClass property, then within Zend\_Pdf class, replace all hard-coded 'Zend\_Pdf\_Page' with $this->\_pageClass.

Such approach should be backward compatible.

This may be a duplicate of ZF-4848 ("\_pdfpageClass property to specify which Zend\_Pdf\_Page object is used to render page").
