### Description

This works :

{quote} $client = new soapClient(self::WSDL\_LINK); $this->return = $client->\_\_call( 'getScores', array(self::CLIENT\_KEY, Zend\_Json::encode($this->chars)) ); {quote}

This not :

{quote} $client = new Zend\_Soap\_Client(self::WSDL\_LINK); $this->return = $client->getScores( self::CLIENT\_KEY, Zend\_Json::encode($this->chars) ); {quote}

I ever try it :) It's the same issue. The matter is upstream. (sorry for my english)

Also, are you really sure that we must wrap params ?

thx a lot.

Need more details. For example provide a sample wsdl and smallest possible parameters to reproduce this bug

Hello,

look here for WSDL and interface : <http://be.imba.hu/api/soap/0.1/>

chars is an array

$this->chars = array();

$this->char['EU']['Culte de la Rive noire'] = 'Socute'; or $this->char['EU']['Culte de la Rive noire'] = array('Socute', 'Raftel');

Thanks

I get for both version the SOAP Env error message. If is switch back to SOAP\_1\_1 version it works perfect for me.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Soap_Client('<a href="http://be.imba.hu/api/soap/0.1/index.php?wsdl">http://be.imba.hu/api/soap/0.1/index.php?wsdl</a>', array('soap_version' => SOAP_1_1));
    
    $result = $client->__call('getScores', array('ClientKey', 'JsonString'));
    $result = $client->getScores('ClientKey', 'JsonString');


I looked into the code and the PHP internal SoapClient was just extendend and the calls are 100% identical.

Great ! thanks a lot. There isn't information in the WSDL about soap version requirement. With soapClient, this is automatically detected. Maybe could you do the same with Zend\_Soap\_Client ?

another time, thanks for your help and sorry for my english.

Simon
