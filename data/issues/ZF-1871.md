### Description

Original request from Kubek Bartosz:

{quote} Good morning,

I'd like to inform You that it is high likely, that there is a mistake in ZF manual. Please navigate to this section of reference guide: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.gapps.html#zend.gdata.gapps.nicknames) Now go to the subsection "14.6.3.2. Retrieving a nickname". In the second code-box, currently there is :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $query = $gdata->newNicknameQuery('bar'); $nickname = $gdata->getNickname($query); ...


and IMHO this line should be :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $query = $gdata->newNicknameQuery('bar'); $nickname = $gdata->getNicknameEntry($query); ...


Could it be that I'm wrong, but I prefer to make things clear and in order :) Please reply my suggestion if possible.

And sorry that I'm writing to this mail address, but I haven't idea with who I should contact to.

Thank You Greets Kubek Bartosz <http://www.blog.heavymind.net> {quote}
