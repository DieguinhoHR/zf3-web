ZF-4882: Lot of files aren't using UNIX EOL
-------------------------------------------

### Description

Although the coding standards is clear to use UNIX EOL only, lot of files contains a carriage return character. I will correct this with some automation and commit this component by component.

For the record, I am using (in bash):

dos2unix $(grep -lP "\\r" `find -name "*.php"`)
