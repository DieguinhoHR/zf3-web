D'oh! This is a duplicate of ZF-6362. Sorry, I tried to find duplicates before I added the issue.

I really should get all my facts straight before I start writing!

The bad error.phtml file came from downloading the sample Quickstart application, found at this link: [http://framework.zend.com/demos/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/demos/ZendFrameworkQuickstart-20090825.tar.gz)

So, it's not really a duplicate issue after all.

So it's either not an issue or a duplicate, closing as 'not an issue'. Thank you for doing the necessary research yourself.
