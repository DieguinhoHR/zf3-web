### Description

With the current file upload implementation I can't generate an multiple file upload using the same formname similar to example 1 on [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.multiple.php)

the following code will only upload the last file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($files as $file) {
        $httpClient->setFileUpload($file, 'userfile[]');
    }
    $rs = $httpClient->request('POST');

A patch fixing this is attached, however a subtle BC breakage is introduced. Will apply after consulting with people at Zend.

Currently, the unit test for this fix fails...

The implementation of this feature is buggy. See the unit test.
