### Description

This is another bug, which isn't properly fixed at ZF-7207. I think this error is created by ZF-5785.

Paginator doesn't use "\_defaultItemCountPerPage" and show all items instead of only \_itemCountPerPage, if I don't set $paginator->setItemCountPerPage($number);

To fix this bug, you should replace all $this->\_itemCountPerPage to $this->getItemCountPerPage(), as I said in ZF-7207.
