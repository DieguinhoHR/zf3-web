### Description

This class is located in ./Zend/Search/Lucene/MultiSearcher.php but should be in ./Zend/Search/Lucene/Interface/MultiSearcher.php

(Alternatively, the class should be renamed to Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_MultiSearcher)

Really the class just needs to be renamed, as it's not an interface but a concrete implementation of `Zend_Search_Lucene_Interface`. Here's a patch:

The suggested fix breaks backwards-compatibility because an end user may be directly require\_once'ing Zend/Search/Lucene/MultiSearcher.php and expecting to get class Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Interface\_MultiSearcher, which won't work any longer.

Attached patch implementing BC fix for this issue. However, we end up with two classes in a single file, which is technically against ZF coding standards. Is there a better way that i'm not thinking of?

Fixed in trunk (1.12.0): r24862
