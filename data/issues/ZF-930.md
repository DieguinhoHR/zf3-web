### Description

When calling Zend\_Http\_Client::request, some valid URLs end up causing a Zend\_Uri\_Exception when they result in redirects in which relative paths are used in the HTTP response headers. A code example that exposes this is shown below.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require 'Zend/Http/Client.php';
    
    $http = new Zend_Http_Client(null, array('timeout' => 10));
    $http->setUri('<a href="http://portasoft.org">http://portasoft.org</a>');
    
    $response = $http->request('HEAD');
    
    /*
    Output:
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Uri_Exception' with message 'Path "\/news.
    php" is not a valid HTTP path' in Zend\Uri\Http.php:457
    Stack trace:
    #0 Zend\Http\Client.php(775): Zend_Uri_Http->setPath('\/news.php')
    #1 test.php(7): Zend_Http_Client->request('HEAD')
    #2 {main} thrown in Zend\Uri\Http.php on line 457
    */


Firefox 2 and curl 7.15.4 process this URL as expected. Below is the result of manually accessing each URL in the redirection from <http://portasoft.org> to the end of the redirection at <http://www.portasoft.org/e107/news.php>.

 
    <pre class="highlight">

The issue is in Zend\_Http\_Client's handling of relative paths. Around line 774 in the class file for Zend\_Http\_Client is a line that looks like the one shown below. On Windows under PHP 5.2.0, dirname('/e107/') results in '\\' on Windows under PHP 5.2.0, which is of course not the expected response with respect to this application of the function. (In Linux, the same call results in '/' which IS the expected response.) Removing the call to dirname() appears to fix this problem. If complete removal of this call is undesirable, perhaps realpath() might work better.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $path = rtrim(dirname($this->uri->getPath()), "/");

Attached is a patch for current Http\_Client which is currently at revision 3039.

I think I fixed the issue in revision 3618 - please update and test again. It's hard for me to make sure because I have limited access to a Windows machine now.

Update this bug if the issue is not resolved.
