### Description

I have this code:

try { $twitter = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter($config->twitter->username, $config->twitter->password); } catch (Zend\_Service\_Twitter\_Exception $e) { $this->logger->err("Exception caught importing twitter: {$e->getMessage()}\\n"); }

and when twitter offline I get:

Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception: Unable to Connect to <a>tcp://twitter.com:80</a>. Error #110: Connection timed out in /srv/lib/php/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php on line 213

I can see where you are coming from this but I don't think that I should handle the Exception in the twitter client. I will run this by Matthew and/or Ralph to see what they think.

In r18172 I clarified the component's position of not rethrowing HTTP based exceptions by documenting the Exception class expected to be thrown for such errors. Using a service Exception is optional, and many other components instead allow the HTTP exceptions to reach the end user. This will not be changed to preserve the current behaviour, but hopefully the revised class doc blocks will inform future users.
