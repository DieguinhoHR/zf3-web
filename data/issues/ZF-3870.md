### Description

We are running under Zend Core 2.0.4 for IBM, Windows 2003 Server. I have updated ZC to latest version, now we have ibm and pdo\_ibm drivers in version 1.2.3-1. On the server side is IBM DB2 Express-C 9.5 installed on top of Centos 5.2. We can connect to db2 database using db2\_conect and pdo\_ibm connect just fine. But Zend\_Db says: PDO\_IBM driver extension is downlevel. Please use driver release version 1.2.1 or later The exception is thrown on the line 107, line which reads the PDO::ATTR\_SERVER\_INFO We have the same error on Linux/CentOS machine with updated Zend Core 2.0.4 running the same code.

Please, let me know, what details do you need to identify the problem.

Thank you in advance, Miro

I think this issue needs Zend Core Support from Zend Technology, not Zend Framework.

This appears to not be an issue withing Zend Framework specifically, but is a Zend Core issue.

If that is not the case, please reopen with more details. You might be able to find online forum support here: [http://zend.com/forums/index.php/â€¦](http://www.zend.com/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=13) or via the Zend Support on the main <www.zend.com> website.

This has been fixed by SVN13600. We now catch exception in case of driver doesn't support the functionality.
