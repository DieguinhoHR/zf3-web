ZF-1707: Allow other URI's than "http://..."

### Description

Currently, when setting an URI for a Zend\_Http\_Client, it should be a HTTP URI. However, in some cases a Http-client is usefull with other URI's as well. For instance, I tried to connect to a payment service in the Netherlands: iDEAL. This service requires the client to set up a connection with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <a>ssl://host:port</a>


Using this as a URI for the Zend\_Http\_Client results in an exception since the URI is not a valid HTTP URI. Zend\_Uri supports other scheme's than HTTP, therefore it might be usefull to integrate the same kind of multi-scheme support in the Zend\_Http\_Client as well.

Quote from the documentation:

{quote} URIs always begin with a scheme, followed by a colon. The construction of the many different schemes varies significantly. The Zend\_Uri class provides a factory that returns a subclass of itself which specializes in each scheme. The subclass will be named Zend\_Uri\_, where is the scheme lowercased with the first letter capitalized. An exception to this rule is HTTPS, which is also handled by Zend\_Uri\_Http. {quote}

Currently this is the only check:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$uri instanceof Zend_Uri_Http) {
      throw new Zend_Http_Client_Exception('Passed parameter is not a valid HTTP URI.');
    }


Maybe this can be made more dynamic, give the user the responsibility to provide the proper scheme or so...

Hi,

In your example, you use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <a>ssl://host:port</a>


How is this related to HTTP? Do you send an HTTP request and get an HTTP response back? If so, then you are using HTTPS which we already support.

Honestly I am not sure I understand the request - are you looking to support other protocols than HTTP? If so, it should not be done through the HTTP Client but through some other clients.

More information or a full use case would be helpful.

MMM,

you are right. I probably should use the supported HTTPS, currently a socket is opened wih fsockopen():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $fsp = fsockopen("ssl://ideal.secure-ing.com", 443, $errno, $errstr, 300);


I did not notice the way SSL support is integrated in Zend\_Http\_Client. After my vacation I will check this suggestion and report back or close this comment.
