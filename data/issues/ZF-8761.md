ZF-8761: Cannot use Dijit with custom datastore
-----------------------------------------------

### Description

I am using dojox.grid.DataGrid with custom datastore created with custom function registered by ->prependOnLoad($store); With SVN code this no longer works because Dijits are created with separate ->\_getZendLoadActions() in Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/Dojo/Container.php and are forcibly prepended to $onLoadActions[]; While registerDijitLoader() registers there a function with explicit call to dojo.parser.parse(); the Dojo Dijit parser is called before my prependOnLoad function and tries to greate DataGrid before it's DataStore was created by my custom function, which obviously fails.
