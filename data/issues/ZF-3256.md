### Description

Zend Framework is great, I have only two problems with it. One is that there is no AJAX support yet, I use JQuery. Although, this gives me tight control using JQuery. The other is that the view has a lot of $this-> all throughout, I would prefer something simular to CakePHP where you have $helper-> and $view-> etc. The $this-> feels very redundant to have to type everywhere and bloats my view. At least in CakePHP you know your accessing a helper because you use $helper-> I know you may feel this is not critical, its a usability problem which can make people annoyed. Usability can be important.

I noticed that another programmer finds it excessive.

He was able to replace one with the other of: <?= @$var; ?> is same as <?php echo $this->escape($this->var); ?>

[http://akrabat.com/2008/02/â€¦](http://akrabat.com/2008/02/05/a-view-stream-with-zend_view/) and <http://code.google.com/p/simple-php-template/>

Maybe you can introduce a shorthand notation?

I like the CakePHP way, you get $view-> $somethingelse-> ... I know it goes against the ZF way of doing things, "use at will" and your keeping the namespace clean in the view, but could there be some compromise by adding a shorthand notation? I can do it my way, but it leads to non-standard code.

Several things to note here.

First, this past week, we announced a partnership with Dojo, and will be shipping Dojo with ZF starting with 1.6.0. Additionally, we have a variety of support for Ajax already: Json view and action helpers, the ContextSwitch and AjaxContext action helpers, the AutoComplete action helper, etc. It is incredibly trivial to utilize Ajax with ZF already.

Second, regarding removing '$this' from our View implementation: will not happen. The '$this' variable is in part an implementation detail, and would take a complete rewrite to remove. Besides that, there are _good_ reasons for retaining it: it provides a separate variable scope for variables assigned to the view, allows helpers to be encapsulated as classes and not functions (we utilize method overloading in the view object to map helpers to method calls), and provides other functionality that would be unachievable otherwise.

We do have a stream wrapper implementation available in the incubator currently, but it does not remove the $this calls; however, it can serve as a blueprint for doing so. Finally, you may always create your own view implementation by implementing Zend\_View\_Interface.
