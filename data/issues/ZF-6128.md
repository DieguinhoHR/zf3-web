### Description

Hello

I need create a route where the URL result will be: host.com/colombia/place-Tolima I already have a router called "country " where the URL result is: host.com/colombia/ and the source is: $routeCountry = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route( '/:country/:action/\*', array('controller'=>'quote', 'action' => 'index', 'module'=>'default', 'country'=>'default' )); so, this route present conflict with the route that I need because both use host.com/colombia/

I have called my new router "places" and the source is: $routePlaces = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex( '/:country/place-(.+)/\*', array('controller' => 'places', 'action' => 'index', 'module' => 'default', 'country' => 'default'), array(1 => 'place' )); but when I put the url: host.com/colombia/place-Tolima, appear a bug and said : (Action "placeTolima" does not exist and was not trapped in \_\_call() ), I suppose that it presents conflict with the country route.

I don't know how manage that issue, I will be thankful if somebody can help me with that.

Thanks

There can only be one route match, and the routes are processed in order. Since your country route is first and it matches the request (/:country/:action results in array('country'=>'colombia','action'=>place-Tolima')) the routing is short-circuited and your place route is never tried. You must arrange your routes from most specific to least specific (in this case, resgister routePlaces before routeCountry).
