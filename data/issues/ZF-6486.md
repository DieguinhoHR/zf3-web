### Description

I'm using the Zend\_Navigation to build a menu, this is build in the bootstrap file. One of the pages go's to a route, when i'm in that routed page al href's of the pages into my menu go's to that route and not the right module / controller / view..

Here's the code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $pages = array(
        array(
            'label' => 'Company',
            'title' => 'About us',
            'module' => 'newmodule',
            'controller' => 'index',
            'action' => 'index',
            'pages' => array(
                array(
                    'label' => 'News',
                    'class' => 'rss', // class
                    'module' => 'newmodule',
                    'controller' => 'index',
                    'action' => 'index',
                    'pages' => array(
                        array(
                            'label' => 'Archive',
                            'route' => 'blaat', // route
                            'module' => 'newmodule',
                            'controller' => 'index',
                            'action' => 'hallow',
                            'params' =>array("year"=>"2009")
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        ),
    );
    $view->navigation()->addPages($pages);
    
    
    $router = $frontController->getRouter();
    $router->addDefaultRoutes();
    $router->addRoute(
        'blaat',
        new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
            '/archive/:year',
            array(
                'module' => 'newmodule',
                'controller' => 'index',
                'action' => 'hallow',
                'year' => (int) date('Y') - 1
            ),
            array('year' => '\d+')
        )
    );

I have the problem with the $this->navigation()->menu(); function When I first call $page1->getHref(); and then the menu function the problem don't appears

This is probably because you haven't specified any route for the other pages. If I recall correctly, the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url (which the component uses to generate URLs) will use the currently active route if null is given as $route in the call to $helper->url($params, $route, ...).

Does it work as expected if you specify 'default' as module for the other pages?

 

 

Posted by Deleted (cmodijk) on 2009-05-01T12:46:47.000+0000

Yes this work's thanks!

But... It is a little strange because the code I uses is from the documentation @ [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.navigation.setup)

Maybe it's a idee if the 'route' is not specified the value automatic is default?

That was the case originally, but it was changed to null because many users reported that they did not use the 'default' route, or changed it to something else.

I'll try and add a note about this in the manual for the next mini release.

Oke, thank you for this information

I have exactly the same problem. Why is this "Not an Issue"? Can someone please explain?

Because this is the way the routing system works. If you don't specify a route to the URL helper (which uses router's assemble() method), it will use assume the currently active route should be used for assembling the URL.

As a concequence of this -- if you use more than one module in your application -- you have to specify which route each page in Zend\_Navigation should be using, because it has no way of knowing itself.

In the earliest versions of Zend\_Navigation (when it was still Zym\_Navigation), pages used 'default' as a default route. This "solved" the issue described here, but it causes problems for people not using a default route, or has a default route that is not named 'default'. That's why the default route was dropped from pages in Zend\_Navigation, to be true to the ZF spirit of not imposing restrictions or lay assumptions on application structure.

Hope this helped clarify. If not, just ask. It should also be said that I _do_ see how it would be useful to have the default route specified, since it would mean less configuration. This is something we have to discuss in the community, and get feedback from the zenders (Matthew).

Specifing default for all the other pages worked for me. What is the difference between null and 'default' route and why Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url uses the currently active route?

 

 

Posted by Robin Skoglund (robinsk) on 2009-09-20T13:02:28.000+0000

null means "use the currently active route" 'default' means "use the actual route instance named 'default'"

...as it should be, really.

Thanks for answering my questions. It would be very useful to add a note under "Example 37.4. Using routes" describing this issue. [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.navigation.pages.html)

I don't think it is a good idea to change the behavior so much. There should have been made a solution to specify a "default" route. This way, neither the "Default" route can be used without much configuration, neither some other differently named default route.

Here is a simple solution that reverts the old behavior, for "menu" and "url" helpers.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Old_Controller_Router_Rewrite extends Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite {
    
      public function assemble($userParams,$name=null,$reset=false,$encode=true){
        if ($name == null) {
          $name = 'default';
        }
        return parent::assemble($userParams, $name, $reset, $encode);
      }
    
    }


Something similar should be done in next ZF release (before 2.0 :-) )
