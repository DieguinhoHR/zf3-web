Zend Framework uses the CLDR files, but is not allowed to change and then redistribute them. Therefore you'll have to file an issue report at CLDR.

Even if it does not exist anymore now... Unicode will not erase East Germany because it exists in past, and it will kept for historical reasons within the country translation table.

For territories it's already not available. You just need to look for the right list when you want to provide only existing countries, or delete it manually from the translation list.
