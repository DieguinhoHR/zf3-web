ZF-9835: Zend\_Form\_Element overrides Zend\_Validate DefaultTranslator

### Description

cf ZF-9275 comments for a complete description of the problem including the defective source code.

The issue in ZF-9275 has not been fixed because of a bug in Zend/Form.php

Zend\_Translate registry is set automatically by the resource method getTranslate This in turn sets the translator for elements in Zend/Form/isValid() via the getDefaultTranslator method. Since the element translator is initialized the Zend\_Validate\_Abstract default translator cannot be used.

Hence, the files in resources/languages/xx/Zend\_Validate.php cannot be used normally unless using one of those workarounds:

- setting the validator translator file to Zend\_Form default translators.
- disabling the Zend\_Translate registry setting.

We should not see the forms elements translators override the validators translators since they address different translation sentences.

Sorry, but I don't see why this should be a problem of Zend\_Translate? Zend\_Translate can not affect how other components behave.

It is a problem with 'Zend\_Translate' registry key, not Zend/Translate.php

The affected files are: library/Zend/Form.php library/Zend/Form/Element.php resources/languages/??/Zend\_Validate.php library/Zend/Application/Resource/Translate.php

And why should Zend\_Translate not use the registry key "Zend\_Translate" ??

Zend\_Cache uses the registry key "Zend\_Cache"... Zend\_Locale uses the registry key "Zend\_Locale"...

Generally all registry keys with "Zend\_" are reserved for Zend\_ component usage.

I still don't see the problem with Zend\_Translate.

I did not say it has to be deleted I say it has to stop overriding Zend\_Validate\_Abstract default translator.

Zend\_Translate being set generates a bug which makes Zend\_Form\_Element translator override Zend\_Validate\_Abstract default translator. That doesn't mean it should be unset, only that the bug should be fixed.

Sorry this bug does not belong to only one component, it is an intricated bug that starts from the Boostrap and ends in Zend\_Form/Element.

The way translators are handled is defective and leads to numerous problems since the approach is to give priority to some translators over others instead of a parallel approach which would favor reusability.

There should be a 'Zend\_Translate' registry key only as a fallback, not something that would override other settings such as Zend\_Validate\_Abstract default translators.

Closing as non issue.

You noted that Zend\_Translate behaves buggy but you can not provide a usecase which shows this behaviour even after several replies.

Zend\_Translate has nothing to do with the resources, Zend\_Form, Zend\_Validate or Zend\_Application.

All of these classes which were mentioned make use of Zend\_Translate and not reverse.

Zend\_Translate itself can not affect how it is used by others or how other components behave. There is no way how Zend\_Translate can change the usage of it's own registry key when this key is used by other components in an unexpected way.

As mentioned before, you have the full description of the bug in ZF-9275 comments. The day you will use the components you design you will see what the problem is. As for me, I'm done reporting bugs for you.

ZF-9275 is a bug of Zend\_Form, not Zend\_Translate. I don't see how I can affect how Zend\_Form behaves by changing Zend\_Translate.

I am maintainer of Zend\_Translate. And you stated in your issue and your second reply that there is a failure within Zend\_Translate. When you see a bug within Zend\_Form then you please add a issue for the this component with some code for reproducation and not for another component.

Note that I did not design Zend\_Form. This is an "open source framework". Which means that people like me are giving their sparetime for others like you. I am not paid for this service nor for my sparetime. So there is no reason to get nasty.

You are the maintainer of Zend\_Translate then do me a favor: explain to other maintainers that there is no such things as 'priority' in translations. When a sentence is translated right I want to reuse it not see another translation override something that works.

You are giving free time I'm grateful because that bug is over 3 monthes old and still not fixed, yet it is classified as RESOLVED. People would be fired for that in a company.

The way it is analyzed is wrong, and even if it was right the code is also wrong.

I have described it well enough in ZF-9275 and also here, I don't see how opening another issue would get the problem fixed.

Another thing you could do would be to associate keywords to translations so things wouldn't be so confusing to other maintainers.

{quote}Which means that people like me are giving their sparetime for others like you. I am not paid for this service nor for my sparetime.{quote} I'm not paid either to report bugs to developers like you. I spent many hours commenting on this issue, waited 3 monthes to see it fixed, I even listed the exact source code which is defective, you and other maintainers just have to look and fix the issue.

It sure would have been less a trouble to me to not report this issue and use a workaround. When you close an issue because it is referred as'Zend\_Translate' instead of 'Zend\_Form', it is disheartening to those who took time to report it and not helping to improve anything at all.

The issue is still here and I am not going to comment on it anymore.
