### Description

Try tu creat PDF document with special characters like 'ąčęėįšųūž' then i creat PDF document i see only 'šž' in document. All this ąčęėįšųūž characters is used in Lithuanian language.

Here is code example:

$message = 'ąčęėįšųūž'; $page->setFont(Zend\_Pdf\_Font::fontWithName(Zend\_Pdf\_Font::FONT\_HELVETICA), 20); $page->drawText($message, 100, 510, 'UTF-8');

In created documen i see only - 'šž'

So i try include font. Code example:

$message = 'ąčęėįšųūž'; $include\_font = Zend\_Pdf\_Font::fontWithPath('times.ttf'); $page->setFont($include\_font, 20); $page->drawText($message, 100, 510, 'UTF-8');

Now in created PDF document i see all his characters which and try - 'ąčęėįšųūž'. Result is good.

So problem is with Zend\_Pdf\_Font::FONT\_HELVETICA. Also try all standard 14 PDF fonts, but rezult is same.

That's correct behavior.

Standard PDF fonts support only Latin1 character set (actually some superset of Latin1 CS), even input string fro text drawing is represented in 'UTF-8' or any other encoding. Appropriate TTF fonts should be used for other character sets.

I've just registered it as a Documentation improvment issue ([ZF-3650](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3650)).
