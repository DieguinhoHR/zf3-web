### Description

I am unable to set additional backend options to Zend\_Db\_Table MetadataCache.

I tried passing in the cache\_file\_umask param like so:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $frontendOptions = array(
       'automatic_serialization'  => true,
       'lifetime'                 => 86400,  
    );
    $backendOptions  = array(
       'cache_dir'         => APPLICATION_ROOT . '/data/cache',
       'cache_file_umask'  => 0666
    );
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::setDefaultMetadataCache($cache);


But then the metadatacache would not work.

An example of where this would be userful is when both a cron (run as a system user) and regular web requests from Apache have to read/write to the same cache files.

If the cron creates the cachefiles, the Apache process is unable to read/write to them. The opposite is also true if Apache created the metadatacache files first -- the cron will be unable to read/write the cache files.

From the report, I am not sure I understand how this is related to Zend\_Db\_Table. Can you please elaborate on how this problem is manifested only in situations where Zend\_Db\_Table is in use?

Sure, take a look at example #32 here: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.metadata.caching)

Ralph wants to say that there is no relation with Zend\_Db\_Table. This is due to a bug in the File backend or the configuration of your system.

I think it's a conflict between two users of the permissions system. Your _safe\_mode_ directive is on or off?

 

 

Posted by jsnod (afx114) on 2010-09-23T10:42:52.000+0000

safe\_mode is Off. The regular cache works fine. It is only the MetadataCache that does not accept any backend options other than cache\_dir.

Can you show the permissions of the cache files created for metadata?

Here are a few files from the list:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    -rw-------  1 apache  apache   669 Sep 22 18:16 zend_cache---eca1091f12f77c77858eef5a4684b979
    -rw-------  1 apache  apache   982 Sep 23 09:48 zend_cache---f6f0f4e4e1b86a6e35427bfd7ee128ce
    -rw-------  1 apache  apache    98 Sep 22 18:16 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---1683d48add005d58009f47911b42a3e0
    -rw-------  1 apache  apache    98 Sep 22 18:16 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---23a9806dc89c4147cbc66f2d331b1b87
    -rw-------  1 apache  apache    98 Sep 22 18:17 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---4391ff602d862cefa2695c3edde37dbd


As you can see they are owned by the apache user, so if I try to execute a cron as a shell user, the scripts don't have access to read/write. That is why I would like to be able to pass in the _cache\_file\_umask_ backend option so they can be created as 0666 files.

Again, I do not believe it is a problem with my system configuration because the regular cache works fine. I am able to pass in a _cache\_file\_umask_ option into the cache backend so that the files get the proper permissions:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 apache apache 710 Sep 23 09:46 zend_cache---MyKey_569713589
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 apache apache 132 Sep 23 09:46 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---MyKey_569713589


However, if I pass in _cache\_file\_umask_ as a backend option to MetadataCache, the MetadataCache fails (does not get written). This is the bug I am reporting.

To reproduce, simply use the code posted in the bug description. If you pass in a _cache\_file\_umask_ the MetadataCache will not be written.

I reproduce your issue in a script :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    
    $frontendOptions = array(
       'automatic_serialization'  => true,
       'lifetime'                 => 86400,  
    );
    $backendOptions  = array(
       'cache_dir'         => dirname(__FILE__),
       'cache_file_umask'  => 0666
    );
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    $cache->save(array('test' => 'content'), 'sample');
    
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('PDO_SQLITE', array(
        'dbname' => ':memory:'
    ));
    $db->query('CREATE TABLE `zf10488` (`id` INT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`id`));');
    Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db);
    Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultMetadataCache($cache);
    
    $dbTable = new Zend_Db_Table(array(Zend_Db_Table::NAME => 'zf10488'));
    var_dump($dbTable->info(Zend_Db_Table::METADATA));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ php zf-10488.php
    $ ls -l 
    -rw-r--r--     1 daemon  daemon  797 Sep 24 06:42 zf-10488.php
    -rw-rw-rw-     1 daemon  daemon  325 Sep 24 06:42 zend_cache---f17f4f9e7c8e73320cef3a028414ba84
    -rw-rw-rw-     1 daemon  daemon   98 Sep 24 06:42 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---f17f4f9e7c8e73320cef3a028414ba84
    -rw-rw-rw-     1 daemon  daemon   98 Sep 24 06:42 zend_cache---internal-metadatas---sample
    -rw-rw-rw-     1 daemon  daemon   31 Sep 24 06:42 zend_cache---sample


The metadata use the same instance of Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File, and the same save method. It seems absurd to have this error that appears just for a table metadatas. Look at the code used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    825            if (null !== $this->_metadataCache && !$this->_metadataCache->save($metadata, $cacheId)) {


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    390            $result = $this->_backend->save($data, $id, $tags, $specificLifetime);


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    249        $res = $this->_filePutContents($file, $data);


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    990        @chmod($file, $this->_options['cache_file_umask']);


Try to find why _chmod_ does not work with the _umask 0666_ in your case. I do not see how we can help. You can edit _Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php_ in order to delete the character _@_.

My apologies, _cache\_file\_umask_ as a backend option works. But _hashed\_directory\_level_ does not. It works fine with regular cache, but not table metadata cache. Can you re-try your testcase above, but with the following options?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $backendOptions  = array(
       'cache_dir'             => dirname(__FILE__),
       'cache_file_umask'      => 0666,
       'hashed_directory_level => 2
    );


It looks like all table metadatata cache files get put into the root of the specified cache\_dir by default. So perhaps hashed\_directory\_level is irrelevant here. But if so, should it not throw an error, or at least be ignored? Passing it in as a backend option breaks table metadata caching with no warning. I wrapped everything around a try/catch block but didn't catch any exceptions.

 

 

Posted by Benoît Durand (intiilapa) on 2010-09-25T23:42:51.000+0000

This is not an issue. Your configuration is wrong: look at the default value of the option _hashed\_directory\_umask_ (0700).

 

 

Posted by jsnod (afx114) on 2010-09-26T11:39:48.000+0000

Ok, but I'm curious -- why does passing in the _hashed\_directory\_level_ option break the table metadata cache? Should I open another bug regarding the usage of _hashed\_directory\_level_ on table metadata cache? If it's not a valid option, ZF should throw an exception. If an exception had been thrown I probably wouldn't have filed this bug and wasted everybody's time.
