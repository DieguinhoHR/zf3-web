### Description

As stated into today talks on fw-mvc, and also since same approach is used over other form API's (HTM Quick Form, aso) would be nice to have 2 things:

1. Each field who is required to have a \* after label
2. At the end fo the form to be writed: Fields marked with \* are required.

Feature should be enabled/disabled by config file also.

It would also be nice if the required marker was configurable in as many ways as possible - some websites actually like using the word "required", others like using a class to render the label in a different colour, probably many more too but those ones spring to mind first.

I personally don't want the decorators to get too complex, as they become harder to maintain and document.

My preference will be to add a class of 'required' to labels of required elements, and a class of 'optional' otherwise; this behaviour will be the default.

Additionally, I'll allow setting optional decorator parameters for 'requiredPrefix' and 'requiredSuffix'; these can be arbitrary text, and would be placed between the tags. Any functionality beyond this would be something the user would be expected to create in a custom Label decorator.

Resolved in r7706.

By default, the Label decorator now adds either the class 'optional' or 'required' to the HTML label element. Additionally, you can optionally specify any combination of the following decorator options or element attributes:

- optionalPrefix: text to prepend to label when element is optional
- optionalSuffix: text to append to label when element is optional
- requiredPrefix: text to prepend to label when element is required
- requiredSuffix: text to append to label when element is required
