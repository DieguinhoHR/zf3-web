ZF-9595: lastBuildDate is missing from an RSS feed created with Zend\_Feed\_Writer

### Description

According to this: [http://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/…](http://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/warning/SlashDate.html), a lastBuildDate tag should be present in the channel section when there's a slash:comments tag in any of the entries. However, I can't seem to find a way to set the lastBuildDate property with the Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Feed object instance I create.
