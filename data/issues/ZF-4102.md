### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element\_File does not deliver file name of uploaded file when form element is inside a subform.

As far as i was able to find out. Zend\_File\_Adapter\_Http stores the uploaded files internal in \_files[SUBFORM-NAME\_\_ELEMENT-NAME], but on Zend\_Form\_Element\_File isValid() calles $this->setValue($adapter->getFileName($this->getName())); providing the elements name. The adapter now returns null because it cant find an entry in \_files for the elements name.

public function getFileName($file) { $file = (string) $file; if (!array\_key\_exists($file, $this->\_files)) { return null; }

 
        $directory = $this->getDestination($file);
        return $directory . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $this->_files[$file]['name'];
    }


Having the element in the form instead of a subform works fine.

Yep, I'm having the same problem, to recreate it simply add a Zend\_Form\_Element\_File in a subform and when you submit the file you get the error:

Notice: Undefined index: name in C:\\workspace\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\Abstract.php on line 745

I second that.

I reckon it'll be pretty hard to fix without modifying Zend\_Form itself. I stumbled on the same issue while implementing my own Form\_Element\_File class.

The problem being that at the time of validation Zend\_Form\_Element(s) aren't aware of their fully qualified name. This is generally not an issue for other elements since they don't have to dig themselves into the $\_POST array, but in this case the element needs to analyze the $\_FILE array by itself.
