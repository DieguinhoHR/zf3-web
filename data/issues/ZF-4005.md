### Description

When using a non XHTML doctype such as HTML4\_STRICT, the doctype header generated by the view helper adds invalid attributes to the tag.

Using <?php echo $this->doctype() ?> will generate the following invalid markup

www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">

Both xmlns and xml:lang are not valid attributes for HTML4 Strict.

Run pages through w3c validator as a confirmation when using HTML4\_STRICT

You have misconstrued the usage of the doctype() helper. The helper serves two purposes, and two purposes only: \* Echo out the selected doctype string (and allow selection of said string using mnemonics) \* Hint to various doctype-aware helpers the general doctype -- primarily to determine what style closing tag to generate. It is _not_ intended as a filter to ensure the final document validates against the W3C specifications.
