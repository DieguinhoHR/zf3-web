### Description

The code for Zend\_Form\_Element\_File and isValid() is missing some code for validating the validators.

If one compare Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::isValid and Zend\_Form\_Element::isValid

One could see that the code for checking all validators is missing?

Validation is done by Zend\_File\_Transfer and not by Zend\_Form\_Element\_File. The validation is either done by calling the isValid() method or by calling the receive() method which itself calls the isValid() method.

As you can see, the receive() method is called by Zend\_Form\_Element\_File which means that file uploads are also validated.
