### Description

He problem is located in the file Zend/Validate/Abstract.php on line 219 - 222

if ($translator->isTranslated($message)) { $message = $translator->translate($message); } elseif ($translator->isTranslated($messageKey)) { $message = $translator->translate($messageKey); }

If only the $messageKey is translated I get an error message that the $message is not translated In my environment the key "notEmptyInvalid" is translated. The correct translated values are displayed on the page but I get the error message: Untranslated message within 'de': Value is required and can't be empty

I am not able to reproduce the described behaviour within trunk.

Please give a reproducable usecase.

Closing as not reproducable. Feel free to reopen when you have some reproducable code.
