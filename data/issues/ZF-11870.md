### Description

Using no user defined routes, the logic used to find a the controller and view are inconsistent and may find the controller without finding the script.

The following url:

/news/case-studies../

Will hit NewsController, CaseStudiesAction, but barf when it tries to find 'news/case-studies-.phtml'.

Inspecting the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer::getInflector(), we see why:

':module' => array('Word\_CamelCaseToDash', 'StringToLower'), ':controller' => array('Word\_CamelCaseToDash', new Zend\_Filter\_Word\_UnderscoreToSeparator('/'), 'StringToLower', new Zend\_Filter\_PregReplace('/./', '-')), ':action' => array('Word\_CamelCaseToDash', new Zend\_Filter\_PregReplace('#[^a-z0-9' . preg\_quote('/', '#') . ']+#i', '-'), 'StringToLower'),

The controller regex will remove periods, while the action regex does not.

If it finds the controller, it should find the associated view script, per your documentation. Or, at the very least, a better exception than EXCEPTION\_OTHER should be thrown, as it's currently not possible to reliably trigger a 404 condition, which it should. (it's logical to return a 500 for EXCEPTION\_OTHER, while throwing a 404 for EXCEPTION\_NO\_CONTROLLER and EXCEPTION\_NO\_ACTION). Maybe an EXCEPTION\_NO\_SCRIPT? Or, better yet, have it find the viewscript if it finds the controller.
