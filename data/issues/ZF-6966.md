ZF-6966: Zend\_Db forces 'naming convention'
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-09T07:40:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-09-20T14:57:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.3 (22/Sep/09)

### Description

Here's my setup:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    db.params....
    db.params.adapter = vendor_Db_Adapter_XXX


Whenever I use this, Zend\_Db::factory() does not honor my naming convention, but instead forces an upper case letter, thus making it Vendor\_Db\_Adapter\_XXX, instead of vendor\_Db\_Adapter\_XXX which leads to an error (Zend\_Loader can't find the class, etc.).

The quickfix is of course an include statement, which doesn't hurt anyway since I am using my custom adapter on each request, but I wanted to file this bug anyway to get it fixed. Wouldn't hurt to be more open in this case. I also know sure that this cannot be introduced/changed without breaking BC.

Isn't this an issue with Zend\_Loader rather than Zend\_Db? Anyways, Zend\_Loader is based on the ZF naming conventions. If you want to deviate from that I suppose you'll need to use your own autoloader (or try the fallback autoloader).

@Dolf agree this is a Zend\_Loader issue, and even then, not really an issue.

The problem is with the code in the factory that does this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            /*
             * Form full adapter class name
             */
            $adapterNamespace = 'Zend_Db_Adapter';
            if (isset($config['adapterNamespace'])) {
                if ($config['adapterNamespace'] != '') {
                    $adapterNamespace = $config['adapterNamespace'];
                }
                unset($config['adapterNamespace']);
            }
            $adapterName = strtolower($adapterNamespace . '_' . $adapter);
            $adapterName = str_replace(' ', '_', ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', $adapterName)));


Unfortunately, we cannot fix this until 2.0 time. I would postpone, but the likelyhood of this exact code making it into 2.0 is highly unlikely since 2.0 will more than likely take advantage of real namespaces.

As Dolf mentioned above, this can be handled with a custom Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader.

Fixed with the solution in ZF-5606
