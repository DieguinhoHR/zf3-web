### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::fetchAll() doesn't consider a columns, table name and shema (FROM clause) at formation of the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!($where instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Select)) {
                $select = $this->select();
    
                if ($where !== null) {
                    $this->_where($select, $where);
                }
    
                if ($order !== null) {
                    $this->_order($select, $order);
                }
    
                if ($count !== null || $offset !== null) {
                    $select->limit($count, $offset);
                }
    
            } else {
                $select = $where;
            }
    
            $rows = $this->_fetch($select);


If the developer will want to specify own fields when building the query (for example in a method \_setupMetadata () of his class that extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract) they will not be considered and instead of this all fields will be fetched.

To fix this, we need to correct a code above:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!($where instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Select)) {
                $select = $this->select();
    
                if ($where !== null) {
                    $this->_where($select, $where);
                }
    
                if ($order !== null) {
                    $this->_order($select, $order);
                }
    
                if ($count !== null || $offset !== null) {
                    $select->limit($count, $offset);
                }
               
                // here is changes
                $select->from($this->_name, $this->_cols, $this->_schema);
            } else {
                $select = $where;
            }

This isn't really required. How it works is that:-

- A $select object is instantiated, as you've noted above
- When the \_\_toString() method of the $select object is called, the object checks for a 'FROM' table
- If one doesn't exist, it adds it, using the method described above, so any change to \_name, \_cols or \_schema will be automatically added
