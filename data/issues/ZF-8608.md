### Description

The form for '<http://localhost/guestbook/sign>' doesn't render for the my version of the project as well as the solution. Also, I'm using the trunk release of ZF which is 1.10.0alpha and the solution project uses 1.8.0dev.

Please provide more Information, does this Issue persist for you in current stable release 1.10.2? If yes, give a stripped down example to reproduce this behaviour.
