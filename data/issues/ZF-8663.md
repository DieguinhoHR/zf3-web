### Description

Zend\_Json's internal encoder fails to encode the solidus (<http://www.json.org/> and <http://www.json.org/string.gif>) when attempting to encode strings. This could potentially result a potential security risk when transfering un-escaped and unsafe HTML to a json client who's primary intention is to display it in the browser.
