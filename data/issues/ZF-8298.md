ZF-8298: Zend/Cache/Backend/Sqlite.php return empty result
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-11-12T19:02:43.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-12-17T18:21:49.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Supplying the multiple tags to "public function getIdsMatchingTags($tags = array())" return empty result.

Solution:

Changing "$ids = array\_intersect($ids, $ids2);" to "$ids = array\_merge($ids, $ids2);" returns correct result.

Tested current version, not sure about other ones.

Cheers

P.S. if you are fixing the issue with above solution then there is not differents between

public function getIdsMatchingTags($tags = array())

and

public function getIdsMatchingAnyTags($tags = array())

Could not reproduce as of r19737

getIdsMatchingAnyTags() is using an array\_merge() getIdsMatchingTags() is using an array\_intersect()

Both are working as intended
