### Description

Csv.php

at the moment we have

if (feof($this->\_file)) { $this->\_translate[$locale][$content[0]] = substr($content[1], 0); } else { $this->\_translate[$locale][$content[0]] = substr($content[1], 0, -2); }

it doesn't work for me (Unix newline)... it kills the last char of my word

$this->\_translate[$locale][$content[0]] = substr($content[1], 0, -1); works for me..

btw.. why we don't use this line:

$this->\_translate[$locale][$content[0]] = trim($content[1]); instead the code above?

Regards

Stephan

Because "trim" changes the content... " My text with leading whitespaces" would not work, the same with whitespaces at the end!!
