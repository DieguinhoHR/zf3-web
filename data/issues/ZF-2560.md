### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_\_call() currently doesn't differentiate between missing actions and missing methods, which can lead to false 404 errors in the ErrorController.

Consider implementing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __call($method, $args)
    {
        if ('Action' == substr($method, -6)) {
            throw new Zend_Controller_Action('Action does not exist', 404);
        }
        throw new Zend_Controller_Action('Method does not exist', 500);
    }


Error controllers could then test for the error code and/or message in order to determine the error type.
