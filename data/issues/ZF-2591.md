### Description

I noticed that when you forget to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::setDefaultAdapter($db); (or don't pass in an adapter via options), it will result in a fatal error. An exception would be much nicer though. :-)

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
