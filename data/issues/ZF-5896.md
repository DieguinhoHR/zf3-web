### Description

This is a fairly large change to the underlying process that we currently have for uploading media entries in Zend\_Gdata. The previous process was to construct a Zend\_Mime\_Message reading the entire binary file to be uploaded into a single string and then passing that around within the class structure. This proved to be very inefficient for video uploads to YouTube, especially when dealing with file sizes that approach 1 gig.

The new functionality creates a Zend\_MediaMimeStream object instead and uses a Zend\_Gdata\_HttpAdapterStreamingProxy for the Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient. Most of the complexity is in Zend\_MediaMimeStream which creates RFC compliant MIME messages and has a read() method that can be called with an arbitrary buffer size (currently set to 1024b). This way both XML and binary can be read and streamed to the server in increments.

The new functionality has been tested through various unit-tests and functional tests.

Functional tests were run both on Linux and Windows platforms and included:

- uploading a < 1mb file to YouTube
- uploading a 100mb file to YouTube
- uploading a 800mb file to YouTube

Video meta-data included Kanji characters to ensure that potential issues with strings could be discovered.
