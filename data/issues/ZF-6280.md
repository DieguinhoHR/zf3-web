ZF-6280: Wrong return type for Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XPath::transform()

### Description

The docblock for Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XPath::transform() indicates that the only return type should be a string. However, when multiple expressions are specified, it is possible for it to return an array. It appears from its test suite that this is expected behavior. See the test suite method testTransformShouldReturnMultiplePathsWhenExpressionContainsCommas(). The docblock should be corrected to reflect this.

Zend\_Dom\_Query::query() passes the return value of Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XPath::transform() as the first parameter ($xpathQuery) to Zend\_Dom\_Query::queryXPath(). The docblock for Zend\_Dom\_Query::queryXPath() indicates that $xpathQuery may only be a string, but can obviously also be an array.

Updated patch to include fix for Zend\_Dom\_Query::queryXPath().
