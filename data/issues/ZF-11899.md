ZF-11899: Buckets With Capital Letters Not Supported
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-11-19T19:15:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-11T00:42:21.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When attempting to pull a list of objects from a bucket with a capital letter the following error response is thrown:

"`SignatureDoesNotMatch`The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method."

Example code to reproduce:

$s3 = new Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3($key, $secret\_key); $buckets = $s3->getBuckets(); foreach ($buckets as $bucket) { $list = $s3->getObjectsByBucket($bucket); }

In this case, if the bucket name has a capital letter (ie 'Capital') then the list will return false. Amazon does support buckets with capital letters even though the Zend Framework documentation says it does not.

@[~zimuel] Could you take a look at this?

Has any progress been made on this bug? It's a pretty serious bug and is still affecting our application. Thanks!

I posted a partial solution to <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1201>

A couple of issues:

1) upper case buckets are allowed only in US-General. All the other locations do not support them 2) Amazon discourages the use of upper case buckets 3) Amazon's own SDK does not support upper case buckets

To support full US General bucket, SOAP api calls are required. Wonder if it's worth it.
