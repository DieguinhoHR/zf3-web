ZF-6387: Zend\_Application Quick Start shows invalid index.php example

### Description

the last lines of the example index.php shown in the [quickstart](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.quick-start.html) shows the following::

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $application->bootstrap();
                ->run();


I assume it should be

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $application->bootstrap();
    $application->run();


unless it is supposed to use fluent interface, which the bootstrap() method does not seem to.

Actually, it does implement a fluent interface. I'm updating the docs now, and they will release with the 1.8 GA.

Fixed in trunk and patched to 1.8 release branch.
