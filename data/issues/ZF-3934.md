### Description

The clean function with CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG and CLEANING\_MODE\_NOT\_:MATCHING\_TAG with File Backend does not work as expected. I think i found a logical problem in this class.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache->save($huge_data, 'myUniqueID', array('tagA', 'tagB', 'tagC'));
    $cache->clean(Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_MATCHING_TAG, array('tagX', 'tagC'));


My logic says that the cache wit id 'myUniqueID' should be cleared. But try it out. It will not be deleted If the first of the tags will not be found the hole entry will not be deleted in the backend.

So i changed the following here in file Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php from line 508 to 531

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                        case Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_MATCHING_TAG:
                            $matching = false;
                            foreach ($tags as $tag) {
                                if (in_array($tag, $metadatas['tags'])) {
                                    $matching = true;
                                    break;
                                }
                            }
                            if ($matching) {
                                $result = ($result) && ($this->remove($id));
                            }
                            break;
                        case Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_NOT_MATCHING_TAG:
                            $matching = true;
                            foreach ($tags as $tag) {
                                if (in_array($tag, $metadatas['tags'])) {
                                    $matching = false;
                                    break;
                                }
                            }
                            if ($matching) {
                                $result = ($result) && $this->remove($id);
                            }                       
                            break;


After changing this the function works as expected.

- - - - - -

a third parameter to the clean function would be fine to affect if AND or OR is used by CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG and CLEANING\_MODE\_NOT\_MATCHING\_TAG

No it works as expected

when you use "$cache->clean(Zend\_Cache::CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG, array('tagX', 'tagC'));" you want to clean cache records which are tagged with tagX **AND** tagC

if you want to clean cache records which are tagged with tagX **OR** tagC, you have to do (two lines)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "$cache->clean(Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_MATCHING_TAG, array('tagX')"; "$cache->clean(Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_MATCHING_TAG, array('tagC')";


It's a choice (because you can do AND and OR). If we choosed your solution, it would be impossible to make an AND
