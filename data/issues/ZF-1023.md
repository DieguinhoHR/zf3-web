ZF-1023: Response::prependBody()

### Description

It would be nice to have prependBody() to complement the existing appendBody(). This helps reduce the total code needed in the bootstrap for prepending a header, such as headers that depend on the results of the action dispatched.

Example: prepending a doctype tag or an xml tag.

You can do this with a workaround already:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $body = $request->getBody();
    $request->setBody($header);
    $request->appendBody($body);


I prefer the named segments issue/proposal you already brought up for this sort of thing, but I'll think on it some more.

Yes, I agree on both counts.

However, getBody() has a side-effect of merging array elements - unecessary step and not performanc-friendly ;)

If there is not enough time for the segments issue/proposal, I was hoping this tiny addition would make it into ZF 0.9, but I also prefer the segment naming approach.

Assign Zend\_Controller issues to Matthew.

This patch is superseded by ZF-1024.

This proposed patch was a much simpler approach than ZF-1024, and was proposed in the even that ZF-1024 could not be implemented in time for ZF 0.9.

Since a patch has been committed for ZF-1024, this issue is no longer relevant.
