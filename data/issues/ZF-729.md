### Description

I do not seem to be able to delete calender events if I have used the ClientLogin authentication method. It does work with AuthSub however. I have tried with my own code and also the demo that was provided.

I can't find any mention in the Gdata Calendar or Protocol documentation that suggests there is an incompatibility between AuthSub and ClientLogin with respect to delete requests. I just tried a delete of a calendar entry with both AuthSub and ClientLogin, and I dumped out the Zend\_Http\_Response object. But I see that the response is different when using the two authentication methods.

Here's the response when using AuthSub. This successfully deletes the calendar entry:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Http_Response Object
    (
        [version:protected] => 1.1
        [code:protected] => 200
        [message:protected] => OK
        [headers:protected] => Array
            (
                [Cache-control] => private
                [Content-length] => 0
                [Date] => Fri, 12 Jan 2007 18:39:47 GMT
                [Content-type] => text/html
                [Server] => GFE/1.3
            )
    
        [body:protected] => 
    )


Here's what is returned when using ClientLogin. This does not delete the calendar entry:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Http_Response Object
    (
        [version:protected] => 1.1
        [code:protected] => 200
        [message:protected] => OK
        [headers:protected] => Array
            (
                [Content-type] => application/atom+xml; charset=UTF-8

                [Content-length] => 1898

                [Server] => GFE/1.3
            )

    )

I have committed a fix in revision 2711 in our subversion repository. The problem was in a place where the Http Client used by the ClientLogin authentication did not correctly set the 'strictredirects' property, so the redirect of the DELETE was being converted into a GET request. This returns a status of 200, but of course does not actually delete the calendar entry.

With the fixed code, the CalendarDemo-ClientLogin.php script works, with no modification. So any PHP code using Zend\_Gdata should be able to take advantage of this fix with no code change.
