### Description

Hi there again, I've got another error. My default route is here: <https://gist.github.com/758515e55ae3fb397350>

$params['controller'] = 'my-controller'; $params['param1'] = 'value1';

$params['action'] = 'myaction';  
 $url1 = $this->url()->fromRoute('default/wildcard',$params); // => OK returns /my-controller/myaction/param1/value1

$params['action'] = 'index';  
 $url2 = $this->url()->fromRoute('default/wildcard',$params); // => KO returns /my-controller/param1/value1 (index action is missing)

I think that I resolved this bug earlier, can you please verify if it still exists?

No further reaction since over a month, closing the issue, as it was probably solved.
