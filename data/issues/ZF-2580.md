ZF-2580: Provide easy access to schema and table name for insertion into SQL query strings

### Description

There should be an easy method for retrieving the schema and table name from a Zend\_Db\_Table instance. It should be a string, properly formatted with quotes, for quick insertion into Zend\_Db\_Select and raw SQL queries. I was thinking this method might be called getSchemaName() â€” unless someone can think of something more concise?

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_\_toString() should proxy this method to make things even more fluent.

I've come up with a solution which works in both these scenarios: \* $query = "SELECT \* FROM $table" \* $select->from($table)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Get a quoted SQL expression which references this table by name & schema.
     *
     * @return Zend_Db_Expr
     */
    public function getSchemaName()
    {
        if ($this->_schema !== null) {
            $ref = array($this->_schema, $this->_name);
        } else {
            $ref = $this->_name; 
        }
        
        return new Zend_Db_Expr($this->getAdapter()->quoteIdentifier($ref));
    }
    
    /**
     * Get a quoted SQL expression which references this table by name & schema.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->getSchemaName()->__toString();
    }

Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join() needs a slight modification to properly support this.

             }
     
    +        if ($name instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Abstract) {
    +               $name = $name->getSchemaName();
    +        }
             if (empty($name)) {
                 $correlationName = $tableName = '';
             } else if (is_array($name)) {


I plan on testing this further, but is there any other use cases that should be accounted for?

Please categorize/fix as needed.

No action on this issue for too long. I'm reassigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

Whats wrong with using $table->info('schema')? I dont think we'd want to support the automatic quoting of schema on return since we cannot infer that it will always be used for injecting into a select statement. I am gonna close as wont fix. Please reopen if you'd like and we can reevaluate.
