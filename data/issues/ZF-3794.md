### Description

Error message for Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception for "Unclosed quotation mark after the character string" displays the user-submited data in a non-secure way, allwing cross-site scripting on error messages.

Exploit code needs to be free from single or double quotes (esaped in the erreor message) or spaces but it's still exploitable like this :

param='

which gives the following :

( ! ) Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 20018 Unclosed quotation mark after the character string ''. [20018] (severity 5) [(null)] in /usr/local/lib/php/ZendFramework-1.0.2/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php on line _227_

Scheduling for 1.6.0GA. One thing to note: you should never, never have display\_errors on in a production system. When display\_errors is off, you will not display this error.

Note : message in exception directly comes from PDO

This is not an issue within Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception itself. The problem you are experiencing is due to your application printing the exception message to the browser.

Generally speaking, applications should send exceptions to a log file or some similar place during production. Since XSS only affects the web, solving this problem inside Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception itself doesnt make alot of sense since Zend\_Db\_Statements can be used in any environment, not just web. Also consider that you could be filtering all of your application exceptions before they are displayed on the screen.
