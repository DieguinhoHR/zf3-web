ZF-1506: Unused Code: setHttpResponseCode ever set isRedirect in Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">        if ((300 <= $code) || (307 >= $code)) {
                $this->_isRedirect = true;
            } else {
                $this->_isRedirect = false;
            }

Maybe the "or" should be an "and", but so it will never use the else-block, because every Code is higher then 300 OR lesser than 307 ;)

In my case my 404-page will not be rendered by the viewRenderer, because 404 set isRedirect and viewRenderer will not render, wenn isRedirect is true.
