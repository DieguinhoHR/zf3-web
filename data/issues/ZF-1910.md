### Description

From the manual: "The Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Null is a stub that does not write log data to anything. It is useful for disabling logging or stubbing out logging during tests."

I would recommend removing Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Null, and instead making either Zend\_Log\_Writer or Zend\_Log configurable with an "enabled" boolean.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [config.ini]
    log.enable = true
    
    [test.php]
    $config = new Zend_Config('config.ini');
    $log = new Zend_Log(new Zend_Log_Writer, $config->log->toArray());


Alternatively, individual writers can be configurable, or both.

Patching in a value for enable/disable of logging is far easier than changing the actual object type to disable logging.

Changing to 'Unassigned'

This is something that should be addressed by a general refactoring to make Zend\_Log more configuration-driven. Because the extent of those changes would require a new proposal, we'll track it in the proposal process. In the meantime, this is relatively easy to implement in application-level code.
