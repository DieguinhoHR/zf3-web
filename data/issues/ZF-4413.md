ZF-4413: Zend\_Config\_Xml does not require Zend\_Config\_Exception everywhere
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-29T05:32:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-29T10:44:44.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_Config\_Xml, and passing a none existing file to the constructor, you will get a fatal error: "PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Config\_Xml' not found in ..."

How to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    set_include_path('library');
    
    require_once 'Zend/Config/Ini.php';
    $config = new Zend_Config_Xml('foobazbar');


The condition on line 67 to 69 is missing the require\_once 'Zend/Config/Exception.php';

Your example requires Zend\_Config\_Ini, but you use Zend\_Config\_Xml .... ?

Either wrong test case or wrong bug.

Sorry, this issue had already been solved. See ZF-4324. I tested it in 1.6, and not in trunk. The test case had a pasto in it as well, but that doesn't matter anymore.
