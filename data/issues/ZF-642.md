### Description

As discussed with Martel, modify MVC components to add accessors to set and retrieve a front controller instance. This would eliminate static calls later, and also allow pasing the front controller into the view helpers and filters, giving them access to the entire MVC environment.

Moving to 0.8.0 for fix; need to discuss more.

This has been done for the router and dispatcher in revision 3004; should it also be done for the action controllers?

In discussion with Martel, will also add to response object, plugin broker and plugins, and action controller.

Zend\_Controller\_Front is a singleton class, and, as such, is accessible from any other piece of code via Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance().

Furthermore, because the $\_instance property storing the singleton instance is protected, by overriding the getInstance() method, you can effectively extend the class and still maintain access to the singleton via Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance().

As an example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Front_Controller extends Zend_Controller_Front
    {
        public function getInstance()
        {
            if (null === self::$_instance) {
                self::$_instance = new self();
            }
    
            return self::$_instance;
        }
    }
    
    $front = My_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    echo get_class($front); // 'My_Controller_Front'
    
    // later...
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    echo get_class($front); // 'My_Controller_Front'


One might argue that static methods do not perform as well as object methods; however, the number of calls to retrieve a front controller instance are likely to be very few, and thus would have little impact on performance.

Finally, if desired, one can simply push the front controller instance into the chain via setParam():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $front->setParam('front', $this).
