### Description

Please see this bug, i think it's a regression bug [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7013?focusedCommentId=49379)

Accessing google calendar my error log gives me include\_once(Zend\\Gdata\\Calendar\\Extension\\EventQuery.php) [<function.include-once>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\\www\\www\\gestionale\\library\\Zend\\Loader.php : 146

include\_once() [<function.include>]: Failed opening 'Zend\\Gdata\\Calendar\\Extension\\EventQuery.php' for inclusion (include\_path='C:\\www\\www\\gestionale\\application/../library;C:\\www\\www\\gestionale\\library;.;C:\\php\\pear') in C:\\www\\www\\gestionale\\library\\Zend\\Loader.php : 146 but the application works anyway.

I am using Windows 7 environment, so it is not a case sensitive problem

Could you provide some code which reproduces your issue?

There is not Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_Extension\_EventQuery class in the framework. There is, however, a Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventQuery class.

Could you please provide a use case example? A small snippet of the framework code without a file name and line number doesn't really help narrow down where the problem is coming from.

You can try the following code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    \Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata');
    \Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin');
    \Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_Calendar');
    $this->_service = \Zend_Gdata_Calendar::AUTH_SERVICE_NAME;
    $this->_client  = \Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient(USER, PASS, $this->_service);
    $this->_client->setConfig(array('keepalive' => true));
    $this->_service = new \Zend_Gdata_Calendar($this->_client);
    $this->defaultQuery = $this->_service->newEventQuery();


It was reported on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8438715/google-calendar-zend-loader-errors)

I did some digging.

In Zend/Gdata/App.php version 1.11.11, lines 1047 to 1058:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1046             foreach ($this->_registeredPackages as $name) {
    1047                  try {
    1048                      // Autoloading disabled on next line for compatibility
    1049                      // with magic factories. See ZF-6660.
    1050                      if (!class_exists($name . '_' . $class, false)) {
    1051                         require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    1052                         @Zend_Loader::loadClass($name . '_' . $class);
    1053                      }  
    1054                      $foundClassName = $name . '_' . $class;
    1055                      break;
    1056                  } catch (Zend_Exception $e) {
    1057                      // package wasn't here- continue searching
    1058                  }   
    1059             }


The class relies on the loader to throw a Zend\_Exception if the file / class it tries to load doesn't exist, or just suppresses the error with the `@` symbol.

Simplified, I have the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    set_error_handler('errorFunction');
    
    function errorFunction($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline)
    {
        throw new ErrorException($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
    }


This clearly doesn't honour the error suppression, and produces the above mentioned error.

This can be fixed for a lot of users by also catching the `ErrorException` and doing nothing with it, just like the `Zend_Exception`.

The simpler fix would be to not throw (non-fatal) E\_NOTICE raises as (fatal) ErrorException. That said, I don't see any problem with catching and ignoring ErrorException here, as chances are that if the file being loaded has errors we're not going to want to use it anyway.

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2012-06-04T13:02:11.000+0000

I've attached a fix and unit test that implements the suggested workaround. Personally, I would prefer that end users not throw E\_NOTICE as an exception, but that's just me. I'll leave it up to the maintainer of Zend\_Gdata or the CR Team to decide if the patch should be applied to the next release.

Not throwing an exception for notices makes sense, but I see in the ZF2 code they cover all their bases just by catching the base Exception class.

It might be a better (simpler) solution than the one I proposed.

Patch applied on trunk (25062) and release-1.12 (25063)

This error still exists in 1.12.1 Zend\_Gdata
