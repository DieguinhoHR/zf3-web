### Description

When doing a query over a collection of more than 100 items and you call isLast() in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb\_Page instance it returns FALSE all the time due to a bug in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb (see ZF-11193).

The error is located at file Zend/Service/Amazon/SimpleDB/Page.php line 84:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return (null === $this->_token);


Should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return empty($this->_token);


I used the empty because when we pass the info on line 405 of SimpleDB.php we are casting the token to a string. The default value of NULL in the constructor of Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb\_Page never is set and then the comparison between empty string and null is FALSE;

What happens with collections of < 100 items? Is the behavior the same, or should we introduce branching logic?
