### Description

Currently I don't see a way to change the HTTP status code using a response object of Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract. (Btw. why is the HTTP specific headers handling in ...Abstract. I expect it in ...Http)

Mayby we can abuse a "Status" header line. This could look like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __toString()
    {
      if (!headers_sent()) {
        foreach ($this->_headers as $header) {
          if (strtolower($header['name']) == 'status')
            header($header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value'], null, (int) $header['value']);
          else
            header($header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value']);
        }
      }
      //...


Use case: ```

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.

HTTP headers are in the abstract as we realized that most apps will be written for the web, but may be re-tooled later for other environments; by having the header() handling in the abstract, we ensure interoperability between both web and non-web environments (non-web environments may choose to simply ignore them or implement them as empty methods).

I like the idea of using the Status keyword, and will implement that shortly.
