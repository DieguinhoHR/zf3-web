### Description

setBodyText, given a string representing the mail body creates an instance of Zend\_Mime\_Part. getBodyText returns this instance from which (if I'm not mistaken) only the encoded content can be recovered. It would be good to have a method to recover easily the original text given to setBodyText.

Assigning to Matthew. Scheduling for fix in 0.7.

I've added a flag to each of getBodyText) and getBodyHtml(); pass true to either of these, and you will receive the content of the MIME part containing the text or html.

One difference, however: the content will be MIME encoded. As we don't have methods in Zend\_Mime for easy decoding of a single MIME part, this will have to be a separate issue.
