-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-07-24T02:45:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-16T14:48:53.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

There is no translation for missing messages

MISSING\_MESSAGE => 'missingMessage';=> "Field '%field%' is required by rule '%rule%', but the field is missing"

NOT\_EMPTY\_MESSAGE => 'notEmptyMessage'=> "You must give a non-empty value for field '%field%'",

You can set them in options. But it would be nice , to have automatic translation like in Zend\_Validate classes

This improvement is no change of Zend\_Translate therefor this component is deleted from the components list to change.
