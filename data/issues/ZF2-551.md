### Description

(sorry for my english :) )

For example, I have the Insert object as follows : [columns:protected] => Array ( [0] => Email [1] => Password [2] => Name [3] => FirstName ) [values:protected] => Array ( [0] => myaddress@gmail.com [1] => monmotdepasse [2] => Name [3] => My first Name )

Then I apply : $insert->Password = "mynewpassword",

So I have :

[columns:protected] => Array ( [0] => Email [1] => Password [2] => Name [3] => FirstName [4] => Password )

 
    [values:protected] => Array
        (
            [0] => smelous@gmail.com
            [1] => monmotdepasse
            [2] => Mélous
            [3] => Stéphanie
            [4] => mynewpassword
        )


So I have now 2 columns "Password" and if I try to apply this query, I have this error message :

File:

 
    /library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Driver/Pdo/Statement.php:216


Message:

 
    SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1110 Column 'Password' specified twice


Thank you very much :)
