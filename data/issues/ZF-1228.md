The classes should be consistent to Coding standard 3.2.

Entry should be the directory and Abstract, Atom and so on should be in this directory.

Thomas has volunteered to do this work. Thanks very much Thomas.

What I would recommend is to create classes Entry/Abstract, Entry/Atom, Entry/Rss, but also keep the old names for backward compatibility. They can be simple extends relationships, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @deprecated since 1.0.0
     */
    class Zend_Feed_EntryAbstract extends Zend_Feed_Entry_Abstract
    {
    }

Actually Zend\_Feed\_EntryAbstract would still be declared as an abstract class.

Fixed as with SVN 4733.

Old Entry\* classes are depreciated and will be deleted before Release 1.0. This issue will stay opened until the old classes are deleted.

Y'e old classes now throw an E\_USER\_NOTICE if they are initialized.

They will be deleted with the release of 1.0RC2.
