### Description

Move URL view helper business logic to a new router method.

This will:

1. Keep business logic in appropriate place
2. Allow similar parts of the framework to run from one codebase (url view helper, url action helpers)
3. Router level assembly should be able to use current path\_info parameters

What's the status of this? Doesn't the assemble() method do this for us already?

Closing as Won't Fix \* Issue description is vague \* Existing router provides logic separation via assemble
