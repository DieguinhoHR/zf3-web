### Description

If you try to add an error to a Zend\_Form\_Element\_MultiCheckBox element an php warning will occur: {quote}Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in ........\\library\\Zend\\Form\\Element.php on line 2101{quote}

- - - - - -

You can reproduce the error by executing this little snippet:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_MultiCheckBox('someVar');
    $element->addMultiOptions(array('hello', 'world'))
            ->setLabel("Hello world")
            ->setRequired(false)
            ->addError('someError');

There has been a bug in addError some time ago, which affected Zend\_Element::addError ([\#ZF-3852](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3852)). Don't know if this is a help for anybody.

The codeblock of the library is the following:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if ($this->isArray() || is_array($value)) {
        $aggregateMessages = array();
        foreach ($value as $val) {
            $aggregateMessages[] = str_replace('%value%', $val, $message);
        }
        $messages[$key] = $aggregateMessages;
    }

The problem seems to be the if-clause. isArray is true, but $value is an empty string, when i run my snippet from above. So the source tries to iterate a string, which does not work and the php-warning for the for-each-loop is thrown. I changed the if-clause to make an AND instead of an OR and it does work:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if ($this->isArray() && is_array($value)) {
        $aggregateMessages = array();
        foreach ($value as $val) {
            $aggregateMessages[] = str_replace('%value%', $val, $message);
        }
        $messages[$key] = $aggregateMessages;
    }

So now, has $value to be an array if we want to loop. It does work, but i don't know if i break something different, but i can't image it, because value HAS TO BE an array for iterating.

This also breaks when using addErrorMessages() So there is no good way to display errors with this field.

See also: ZF-5603

When using addErrorMessages() the bug is in Zend\_Form\_Element::\_getErrorMessages().

When we add error with Zend\_Form\_Element::addError() the following is executed:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Add an error message and mark element as failed validation
    *
    * @param  string $message
    * @return Zend_Form_Element
    */
    public function addError($message)
    {
       $this->addErrorMessage($message);
       $this->markAsError();
       return $this;
    }


Let's take a look at markAsError() function:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $messages       = $this->getMessages();
        $customMessages = $this->_getErrorMessages();
        $messages       = $messages + $customMessages;
        if (empty($messages)) {
            $this->_isError = true;
        } else {
            $this->_messages = $messages;
        }
        return $this;


The problem is in \_getErrorMessages function. The resulting $message var, in case of Multi field will look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $messages = array(
        0 => array(
            0 => 'My custom errormessage',
            1 => 'My custom errormessage',
            2 => 'My custom errormessage'
        )
    )


It's structure is unknown for Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormErrors, therefore there are errors.

I strongly suggest to give full control over the method of validating Multi elements! As for now validators are run on each and every selected value, but there is no way to validate THE WHOLE FIELD, nor give it a GLOBAL SINGLE custom error message. Current architecture does NOT allow i.e. to create a Zend\_Validate\_Count which would throw error if less (or more) number of fields have been selected.

This patch resolves the problem.

added new patch with unit tests.

current Zend\_Form trunk is defect, test with 1.9.2 final, it's working with no side effects.
