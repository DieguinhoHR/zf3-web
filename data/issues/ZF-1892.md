### Description

A not existing column in a combined key cause wrong delete operations.

The "\_getPrimaryKey()" method in the class "Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract" must throw an exception if the count of found columns is not equal to the count of defined primary key columns. The method should not return only one column. If a delete operation is triggered more than one row will be deleted.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _getPrimaryKey($useDirty = true)
    {
            $primary = array_flip($this->_primary);
            if ($useDirty) {
                $array =  array_intersect_key($this->_data, $primary);
            } else {
                $array = array_intersect_key($this->_cleanData, $primary);
            }
            if (count($primary) != count($array)) {
                 // --> throw Exception
            }
            return $array
    }
