Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

I need the caching of arrays/objects too. Zend\_Memory uses Zend\_Cache for swapping, it can't be too hard to implement, or?

Maybe arrays and objects could be serialized in Zend\_Memory\_Value to allow correct calculations of memory usage and unserialized on access.
