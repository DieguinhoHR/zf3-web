### Description

Currently, the manual is build using docbook. This can be a serious hassle for those willing to contribute to the manual. We will be making the change to move from docbook to wiki.

The English manual will be used for testing, and if everything works out well, a full conversion for each language will follow.

_Why switch to wiki?_ \* Make smaller edits easier, and possible by at least everyone on the documentation / translation teams, possibly including all CLA signers. \* Reduce the learning curve and effort required to make edits to the manual and translations. \* Allow anyone to comment on each section, but with comment moderation, so that the manual can evolve more quickly and with more flexibility than the current process. \* Need notification system for edits

We will maintain the ability to translate docbook to wiki, and wiki to docbook, thus avoiding any loss of capabilities.

The foundation has been made, and the wiki manual pages get updated every 30 minutes. Plans have changed for making changes in the wiki itself until we have a solution for exporting the wiki format back to DocBook.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
