### Description

Extending behavior of Zend\_Db\_Select for rendering a query to a string, or supporting RDBMS-specific syntax, requires rewriting the whole \_\_toString() method.

What I think we need to do is make it easier to extend Zend\_Db\_Select by breaking \_\_toString() down into separate methods for each section of the statement, and allow setting of the class returned by select() in the adapter.

Then for situations such as DISTINCT ON support, the solution would be the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyExtendedSelect extends Zend_Db_Select 
    {
         public function distinctOn(array $columns)
         {
             $this->_parts[self::DISTINCT] = $columns;
             return $this;
         }
    
         protected function _distinctToString() {
             if (is_array($this->_parts[self::DISTINCT])) {
                 $sql .= " DISTINCT ON " . /* serialize columns here */;
        } else if ($this->_parts[self::DISTINCT] === true) {
                 $sql .= " DISTINCT";
             }
         }
    }

I wrote a prototype implementation of this refactoring. It's in the ZF Laboratory svn repository:

Resolved in trunk r8084

NOTE: The method names are simply:-

\_renderFrom() \_renderWhere() ...etc..

(the 'toString' seemed superfluous)
