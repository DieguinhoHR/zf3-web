-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-02-14T07:26:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-26T12:56:06.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.4 (26/Feb/08)

### Description

Formats in Zend\_Locale xml data files do not respect typographic rules. e. g. in cs (cs\_CZ) locale, behind every period there should be a space:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    
    insted of current 
    


the same way for date/time: Medium date format should be d. M. yyyy with spaces, Medium time format should be H.mm:ss - with a period between hour and minutes.

For other languages, someone else has to state typo rules, those described are valid for cs and, hopefully, for sk

The data files are legal owned by unicode. If there are any problems or errors within them please go to <http://www.unicode.com/cldr> and tell them about.

You could also look into 1.5.0PR and see if the data is fixed with the latest version from unicode which will be integrated in the next version of ZF.
