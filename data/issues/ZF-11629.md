### Description

Hi.

On the page for all available resoure plugins: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.available-resources.html)

The example for "Translate" application resource.

It says data : path to translation.

whereas it should be content : path to translation.

Otherwise it's not clear which option to use. Also, the option "scan" is never explained.

Greetings, Rene

For details on the options for Zend\_Translate you should look at Zend\_Translate's documentation

Hi Thomas,

I know, I just think it'd be helpful for beginners. Though, I think the data/content issue should be addressed.

Greetings, Rene

According to Line 84:86 of Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Translate it looks like either one will work.

Fixed in ZF2 with [GH-369](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/369)
