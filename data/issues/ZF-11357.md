### Description

Hi,

I am extending Zend\_Soap\_Client and overriding it's \_\_call method just to allow me to do some mundane data preparation before I call the SOAP method but I keep getting an Exception from the server. If I make the same call without overriding the \_\_call it works fine. I don't understand why overriding the \_\_call method is causing this problem. I've checked that the data and the SOAP client object in both cases are exactly the same but it just doesn't seem to work when overriding \_\_call. Any ideas?

Code that doesn't work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __call($method, $data) {
    
        $timestamp = date('c');
        $otherData = array(
            'timeStamp' => $timestamp,
            'apiVersion' => $this->apiVersion,
            'clientSoftwareVersion' => $this->clientSoftwareVersion,
        );
        $requestData = array_merge($otherData, $data[0]);
    
        return parent::__call($method, $requestData);
    
    }


Code that works:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function feeLookup($data) {
    
        $timestamp = date('c');
        $otherData = array(
            'timeStamp' => $timestamp,
            'apiVersion' => $this->apiVersion,
            'clientSoftwareVersion' => $this->clientSoftwareVersion,
        );
        $requestData = array_merge($otherData, $data);
    
        return parent::feeLookup($requestData);
    
    }


Exception that I get from the server:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SoapFault: java.util.EmptyStackException


Thanks Ziad
