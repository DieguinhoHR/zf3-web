### Description

Would it be possible for Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route to provide a getDefault($name) method?

It makes the most sense in an application I'm working on to forward by route name. This means that in my extended Zend\_Controller\_Action class I have the following function declaration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    final protected _route(Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Interface $route, 
                           array $parameters = array())


Normally this would just be a wrapper for \_forward, but I'm using additional routing information beyond controller and action names. Anyway, for this to be useful, obviously Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::getDefault() has to exist.

I can extend it in the meantime, but this seems like useful functionality that's pretty basic to implement. Thoughts?

Two new methods added to route classes: - getDefault($name) - getDefaults()
