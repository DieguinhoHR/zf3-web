### Description

The Constructor for the Zend\_Translate is only calling the setAdapter method. Look how the parameters are passed and compare with the expected parameters in setAdapter.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     /**
         * Generates the standard translation object
         *
         * @param  string              $adapter  Adapter to use
         * @param  array               $options  Options for this adapter to set
         *                                       Depends on the Adapter
         * @param  string|Zend_Locale  $locale   OPTIONAL locale to use
         * @throws Zend_Translate_Exception
         */
        public function __construct($adapter, $options, $locale = null)
        {
            $this->setAdapter($adapter, $options, $locale);
        }
    
    
        /**
         * Sets a new adapter
         *
         * @param  string              $adapter  Adapter to use
         * @param  string|array        $data     Translation data
         * @param  string|Zend_Locale  $locale   OPTIONAL locale to use
         * @param  array               $options  OPTIONAL Options to use
         * @throws Zend_Translate_Exception
         */
        public function setAdapter($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array())
    


Due to this: - is not possible to pass options to the adapters at the time of the translation object creation. - it is not possible to create a Zend\_Translate object without feeding at the same time $data. - since you have to feed in data first and eventually afterwards set the options for the adapter the $data is parsed first with false options

To prevent the creation of a translation object without the possibility of translation you MUST give minimum one source at creation...

This is expected behaviour and decreases possible problems.

Your point one and three are identical... Btw: The deletion of the existing translation source is unneccessary at time of the object creation because at this time there is no existing source avaiable.

Changed the contructor with SVN 5809. After review it will be added with 1.0.1

    <pre class="highlight">
    -       public function __construct($adapter, $options, $locale = null)
    +       public function __construct($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array())


I agree this would have been the best way to design this constructor arguments, but this is a problem now because this change breaks backward-compatibility. My understanding is that this is not okay after 1.0.

Why do you believe it breaks backwards compatibility ???

The internal name of the variable is not breaking this. I could also name it like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($adapter, $options, $locale = null, array $adapteroptions = array())


As you can see here it does not break the compatibility:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    -    public function __construct($adapter, $options, $locale = null)
    +    public function __construct($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array())
         {
    -        $this->setAdapter($adapter, $options, $locale);
    +        $this->setAdapter($adapter, $data, $locale, $options);
         }


I just renamed the second argument because it then has the same named arguments as the internal called "setAdapter" method. As you see the second argument is passed as second to setAdapter as before the change which does not break the compatibility.

I would see a problem if the arguments would have changed their position. But this has not happend.

If you believe the internal name of the argument breaks the backwards compatibility I can also rename it as described above.
