### Description

<http://api.search.yahoo.com> should be changed to <http://search.yahooapis.com/> .

Additionally, I would suggest to move all the following pieces of code into a common method and store base URI in a PHP constant. The code will be more readable and easy to update.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $this->_rest->getHttpClient()->resetParameters();
            $this->_rest->setUri('<a href="http://search.yahooapis.com">http://search.yahooapis.com</a>');
            $response = $this->_rest->restGet('/SiteExplorerService/V1/inlinkData', $options);

The API domain isn't actually constant despite it not changing much at all. i.e. Local search is an exception.

I'll check my local copy (with the new domains) doesn't break anything and if no-one objects I'll make the change.
