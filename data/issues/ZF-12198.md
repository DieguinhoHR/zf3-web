ZF-12198: Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket does not work with IPv6

### Description

In Zend\_Uri\_Http.php, line 231, brackets surrounding an IPv6 are explicitly stripped.

The problem is, nothing puts them back when making the actual connection, leading to invalid ip:port combinations. For example, it should be [::1]:80, but is instead ::1:80

To work around it for now, I patched Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket.php to conditionally wrap the $host variable in brackets on lines 195 and 269. I did it in a decidedly non-Zendy way, but it works.
