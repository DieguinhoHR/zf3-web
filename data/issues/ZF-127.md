### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/150>

I'm having trouble getting the framework to work on IIS, due to what appears to be the requirement for mod\_rewrite.

There was a note in Chris Shiflett's phparchitect tutorial:

One of the TODO items for Zend\_Controller is to remove the mod\_rewrite dependency. In order to provide an example that works with the preview release, this tutorial uses mod\_rewrite.

When is the mod\_rewrite dependency going to be addressed and does anyone have any hacks in the meantime (without having to buy a 3rd party replacement for mod\_rewrite for IIS)?

Thanks.

Hello!

Your problem effectively is a duplicate of #2 (IN TRAC)

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
