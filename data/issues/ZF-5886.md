ZF-5886: Queries against xml document with xml prolog fails

### Description

I was testing generated atom feeds with Zend\_Test and I noticed that when the xml prolog (<?xml ... ?>) is included, like in every Zend\_Feed, the query fails. The fault is of the underlying DOMDocument class, but I think the prolog can be stripped before creating the DOMDocument.

Failing test for an atom feed that cannot be parsed.

Solution: load as xml the document to see if it's valid, but do the parsing as an html document with xml prolog stripped out. This patch pass the tests of Zend\_Dom including new test of zf-5886-test.patch (and also Zend\_Test tests, runned because dependent on Zend\_Dom).
