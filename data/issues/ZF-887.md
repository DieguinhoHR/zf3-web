### Description

Some RDBMS brands, such as MySQL and MS SQL Server, support SQL queries that have no FROM clause. They have a select-list and can accept ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses, but not WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING.

Fixed in revision 3320.

Note that if you have no FROM clause specified, the WHERE, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses are silently ignored. No error or exception is generated.
