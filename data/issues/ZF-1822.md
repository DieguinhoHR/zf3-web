ZF-1822: Multi-line argument for Zend\_Db\_Select::order()
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-08-07T09:52:35.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:28:49.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.2 (25/Sep/07)

### Description

If an expression defined on multiple lines is passed to Zend\_Db\_Select::order() and its set explicitly to ASC or DESC eg:

ACOS( COS(field1) \* SIN(field2) ) DESC

Then it gets added tio the query as ") DESC". Only the last line is matched on the regex on line 721.

If you change the pattern from "/(._)\\s+(ASC|DESC)\\s_$/i" to "/(._)\\s+(ASC|DESC)\\s_$/si" with the addition of the s modifier, it seems to fix the problem.

Precise Version is "Zend Framework Release Candidate 1.0.0 (build 5541)"
