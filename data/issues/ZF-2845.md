### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormReset doesn't allow for being disabled. It is commented with //always enabled

but I'm not sure why. Another odd comment in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSubmit: says // ignore disable/enable, always show the button.

but allows for disable. So that comment should be removed. The following would take care of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormReset:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       public function formReset($name = '', $value = 'Reset', $attribs = null)
        {
            $info = $this->_getInfo($name, $value, $attribs);
            extract($info); // name, value, attribs, options, listsep, disable
    
            $xhtml = 'view->escape($value) . '"';
            }
    
            // add if disable
            if ($disable) {
                $xhtml .= ' disabled="disabled"';
            }
    
            // add attributes, close, and return
            $xhtml .= $this->_htmlAttribs($attribs) . ' />';
            return $xhtml;
        }


I assume that would be sufficient in the current code.

All of the Zend\_View\_Helper\_? in respect to disabling needs to be addressed. The overall scheme seems to want to disable based on seeing the attribs['disable'] key while disregarding any corresponding value. This is an issue if you disable all the elements in a form and then later wish to enable an individual element. Also, Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement has some disable code in \_getInfo that seems to complicate things unnecessarily.
