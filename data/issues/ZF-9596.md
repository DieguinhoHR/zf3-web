### Description

As written here: [http://rssboard.org/rss-specification/…](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#ltimagegtSubelementOfLtchannelgt), there's an optional 'image' tag that can specifies an image file for the feed.

A way to set this image is missing (there's no setImage method for the feed).

I have a first implementation for this currently in trunk/release branch. Really just need to finalise rendering tests tomorrow before I resolve this issue ;). See r22097 for the updated source code to date (lots of it!).

See r22102 for last batch of changes.

Added:

1. Image support parsing for Zend\_Feed\_Reader
2. Image support for Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0 in Zend\_Feed\_Writer
3. Implements all required and optional elements for RSS 2.0 (only a URI is required or used for Atom 2.0)
