### Description

I'm trying to work with the ZfcTwig (<https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcTwig>) module in one of my applications. Everything works, except for mixing up template types.

When trying to use a viewhelper (from a module) which requires phtml files, it fails:

$vm = new ViewModel(); $vm->setLayout('my/viewfile.phtml'); $this->getView()->render($vm);

It can then not find "my/viewfile.phtml" for some reason. I'm pretty sure that the reason for this is the fact that the suffix gets set to .twig in ZfcTwig.
