ZF-10074: Zend\_Mime improperly quoted printable encodes lines with zeros at the end

### Description

If you have a line which is one character longer than the limit that ends with "0", Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable() will strip the character due to implicit numerical conversion.

example line: "\\t\\t\\t\\tyour own goal! Use those 90 minutes being active yourself. A 90" quoted result with a 74 character limit: "=09=09=09=09your own goal! Use those 90 minutes being active yourself. A 9" expected result: "=09=09=09=09your own goal! Use those 90 minutes being active yourself. A 9= 0"

To fix this you need to do an explicit comparison in the while($str) loop:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    -        while ($str) {
    +        while ($str != '') {

This is a major bug and it's still not fixed in trunk.

A test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

         {
             $content = str_repeat("\x88\xAA\xAF\xBF\x29\x88\xAA\xAF\xBF\x29\x88\xAA\xAF", 4);
    


The suggested fix by Chad works correctly.

Patch with fix + unit tests attached. Implemented unit test using provided test cases: \* ZF-10074, by [~sk-lt] \* ZF-11866, by [~interrobang]

Fix suggested by OP resolves the issue, and all unit tests in the Zend\_Mime and Zend\_Mail suites pass after patch is applied.

Unless there is a demonstrable case where this fix breaks backwards-compatibility, I recommend inclusion in next mini-release.
