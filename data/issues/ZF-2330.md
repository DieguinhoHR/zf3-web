### Description

Once unit testing for each file of the component reaches 80% LOC coverage and there exists satisfactory DocBook documentation for the APIs, the Zend\_Db\_Table query enhancements need to be promoted to core (i.e., moved to trunk with unit tests and documentation integrated).

Besides the above, I'm not aware of any. Maybe Simon can give us a status report?
