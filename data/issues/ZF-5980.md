ZF-5980: Zend\_Cache\_Core method visibility
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-10T08:27:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-12-07T10:31:05.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Hi,

Zend\_Cache\_Core doesn't permit to add custom functionality due to all it's private method/property declarations.

Say I want to create my own Zend\_Cache\_Core:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Test_Cache_Core extends Zend_Cache_Core
    {
        public function add($data, $id, ....)
        {
            $id = $this->_id($id);  // This call will fail because Zend_Cache_Core::_id is declared as private
            [....]
        }
    }


Here I can't use Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_id(). Is there any reason for these methods to be private? If you want these methods not to be overridden you could just declare them as 'protected final'

Here is a list of methods I want to use but that are declared as private:

- Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_id()
- Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_validateIdOrTag()
- Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_validateTagsArray()
