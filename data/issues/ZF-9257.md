### Description

Some­times you need to check if request is dis­patch­able. The most com­mon place where you can meet this need is in con­trol­ler plug-in. I have met that I need to test if request is dis­patch­able when I have imple­men­ted my App\_Controller\_Plugin\_Acl for ACL check­ing based on ZF pro­posal. So ACL test is run before request will be dis­patched. Of course I don't want to run ACL checks for requests that are not dis­patch­able. But that plug-in relayed on Zend\_Controller\_Disptcher\_Interface::isDispatchable() method which checks only if controller's class exists.

So I propose to add another action method to check whenever method exists or not, into the dispatcher or at least into the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Plugin\_Abstract as I did in my application extended abstract class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    < ?php
    
    /**
     * Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract
     */
    require_once 'Zend/Controller/Plugin/Abstract.php';
    
    class App_Controller_Plugin_Abstract extends Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract
    {
        /**
         * Return whether a given request (module-controller-action) exists
         *
         * @param Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request Request to check
         * @return boolean Whether the action exists
         */
        protected function _actionExists(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
        {
            $dispatcher = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getDispatcher();
    
            // Check controller
            if (!$dispatcher->isDispatchable($request)) {
                return false;
            }
    
            $class  = $dispatcher->loadClass($dispatcher->getControllerClass($request));
            $method = $dispatcher->formatActionName($request->getActionName());
    
            return is_callable(array($class, $method));
        }
    }


Of course it's just an example, but it shows my idea. According to Nabble's archives I'm not the only one who need this ;))

While I understand the point behind this, the actual location where an action is determined dispatchable is within a controller. The dispatcher actually calls the controller's dispatch() method; while by default this will use the Action() convention, does not have to. In fact, you can even trap action calls via \_\_call() to do custom dispatching (something I've done a number of times).

Taking away this flexibility is not something we plan to do; if anything, we'll likely make it more flexible in 2.0 (action controllers will act basically like plugins, and simply define \_\_invoke()).

The above plugin will work for most use cases, but since it doesn't work for _all_ use cases, we likely will not adopt it.

Well, I was not proposed to add this like an additional plugin, I just proposed to extend existing Abstract class, to have this method. About \_\_call() methods, resulting decision can be extended, to handle such situation, so return will become like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return ( is_callable(array($class, $method))
             || is_callable(array($class, '__call')) );


The main reason why I needed this method was to decide do I need to do real action of some plug-in (Acl in my case) or not, as I don't want to run any Acl logic on non-existing actions.

But I respect your opinion, and don't insist on my proposal adoption. Anyway, as we live in a free world, I can use my proposal for myself :))
