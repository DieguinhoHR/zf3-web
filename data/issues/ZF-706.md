### Description

Prior to ZF 0.6.0 (eg 0.2.0) I could specify the id of hidden fields like:

$this->formHidden($name, $value, array("id" => "theId"));

When moving to ZF 0.6.0 from 0.2.0, the resulting html no longer has the id attribute, which breaks my javascript code.

I have looked at some ZF code briefly and it seems that the function Zend/View/Helper/FormElement::\_getInfo is unsetting the id field when creating the $info array, and the \_hidden function does not use the $id after extract()'ing that variable, so the id gets lost.

I have temporarily hacked my copy of ZF 0.6.0 to include the id, it also affects formCheckbox, which is also losing the id. I do not know if there are any other cases.

I have not marked this issue as a bug as I dont know if this is by design, but it's certainly breaking my code (that worked on 0.2.0) and I see no reason why I cannot specify an id for a hidden field.

Resolved in version 2856.

This is still very much broken.

Given my current version of ZF (svn Revision 1546) + the patch here, this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     
      $xhtml .= $this->formHidden("line[" . $n . "][id]", 
                 $line->id,
                 array("id" => "id_" . $s_l)) . "\n";
      $xhtml .= $this->formHidden("line[" . $n . "][type]",
                 $line->type,
                 array("id" => "type_" . $s_l)) . "\n";
      $xhtml .= $this->formHidden("line[" . $n . "][location]",
                 $line->location,
                 array("id" => "location_" . $s_l)) . "\n";


results in this output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


You can see that the "id" attribute is picking up the value assigned to "name".

It looks like this may be happening in FormElement::\_getInfo() near the top (line 80, or so).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _getInfo($name, $value = null, $attribs = null, 
            $options = null, $listsep = null)
        {
            // the baseline info.  note that $name serves a dual purpose;
            // if an array, it's an element info array that will override
            // these baseline values.  as such, ignore it for the 'name' 
            // if it's an array.
            $info = array(
                'name'    => is_array($name) ? '' : $name,
                'id'      => is_array($name) ? '' : $name,
                'value'   => $value,
                'attribs' => $attribs,
                'options' => $options,
                'listsep' => $listsep,
                'disable' => false,
            );

Oops, sorry, looks like a misfire on my part. Someone else made an unannounced change in the config that changed the zf library path. Not nice.
