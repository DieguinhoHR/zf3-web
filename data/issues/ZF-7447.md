The problem was due to missing files that had no fallbacks in the manual.xml.in -- in particular, line 691 (). Commenting out that line allowed me to build the docs.

I'll be pushing up a new tarball of them for download, as well as publishing them on the site, in the next few hours.

Thank you for your investigation. I've forgotten to commit that file. I committed it (at r17393), so next time you don't have to comment out line 691 again.

Japanese docs updated on online manual, and updated manual tarball now available as well.
