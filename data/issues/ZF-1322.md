Zend\_Log related issue, assigned to Mike.  
 Must previously be accepted by the devteam for inclusion.

Changing to 'Unassigned'

Personally, I would move the count() out of the try block and have it as the first if (). Then clear the events after the e-mail gets sent. That way if someone called shutdown and then added more events they would get sent as well.

Also, maybe add optional header and footers would be nice too. That way you can add more then just a log of events. My need would be to make a table with other descriptions. I'll try to add a screenshot of what I typically e-mail. I'll also try to write an update to this patch for these features.

Example of what e-mails look like from my error logs. If the optional header and footer is added, I can turn the list of events into a HTML table.

Ok, here is what I've put together. Changes since the original patch:

- Removed shutdown check, rather checks for events
- Removed the try/catch block, Zend\_Mail will not throw exceptions anyway
- Changed mail property access to protected (better support for extending the class)
- Changed $mail to $\_mail (seems to be the "Zend" way for naming protected properties)
- Added support to add a header and footer
- Added support to change body type to HTML
- Added header, footer, and html properties as public, shutdown() can deal with improper values

Also, I removed my thought about multiple shutdowns, it's unlikely to happen anyway.

    class Zend_Log_Writer_Mail extends Zend_Log_Writer_Mock

        protected $_mail;

        public $html;
        
        public function __construct(Zend_Mail $mail, $header = '', $footer = '', $html = false)
        {
            $this->_mail = $mail;
            $this->header = $header;
            $this->footer = $footer;
            $this->html   = $html;
        }
        
        public function shutdown()
        {
            // Check for events
            if (!empty($this->events)) {
                
                // Start body, add previous content
                $body  = ($this->html ? $this->_mail->getBodyHtml(true) : $this->_mail->getBodyText(true));
                
                // Add header, cast as string in case non-string set
                $body .= (string) $this->header;
                
                // Add each event and apply the format
                foreach ($this->events as $event) {
                    $body .= $this->_formatter->format($event);
                }
                
                // Add footer, cast as string in case non-string set
                $body .= (string) $this->footer;
                
                // Determin e-mail type and add body
                if ($this->html) {
                    $this->_mail->setBodyHtml($body);
                } else {
                    $this->_mail->setBodyText($body);
                }
                
                // Send e-mail
                $this->_mail->send();
            }

    }

Should you may be a little more careful with the "html" data member?

For example, if I set the "html" data member to some random object, won't that cause the setBodyHtml() call to barf somewhere along the way?

Maybe do an is\_scalar() check before that "if ($this->html)" check in shutdown()? That or cast it to a string as you do with "header" and "footer".

Though, personally, I'd tend to prefer getHtml() and setHtml() instead of public data members.

 

 

Posted by Brian DeShong (bdeshong) on 2008-06-23T15:13:27.000+0000

Ah, nevermind about my previous comment. It's a non-issue due to the ternary expression for setting $body above.

 

 

Posted by Ryan Panning (panman) on 2008-06-24T05:56:47.000+0000

I had thought about that but decided it shouldn't be a big deal. If like you say, the html property is set to an object, the if statement should just count it as true. The value is not actually used anywhere.

I also like to force getters and setters but it also seems to be the "Zend" way to keep things rather open. After all, PHP is supposed to be very flexible with their data types. This is an example of why it really doesn't matter. It's the users fault if they set html to anything other than boolean. [End rant] :)

 

 

Posted by Brian DeShong (bdeshong) on 2008-06-24T06:12:18.000+0000

Eh, personally, I tend to agree with making "header", "footer", and "html" public data members. I'm by no means a Jedi Master on Zend Framework's preferences when it comes to these types of decisions, but for the sake of a clear interface, I'd prefer to see the getters and setters rather than have willy nilly access to the public data members.

Quick, rough stat from trunk: out of 1,081 \*.php files, I see that only 86 have public data members, which would lead me to believe that this isn't a common practice. A large portion of those 86 come from Zend\_Form and Zend\_Service.

Again, this would just be my personal preference for the sake of a clear interface.

 

 

Posted by Ryan Panning (panman) on 2008-06-24T07:49:37.000+0000

Actually, I'm glad they don't use public members throughout the framework. I like how you added the stats in there. :) I am very new to ZF and just started to work with it. The log was the first thing I am working on and this is what was missing.

Also, digging into HTML in e-mail a bit more, I wonder if setting a HTML body and text body would be a nice feature. Then set the $\_mail->setType() to Zend\_Mime::MULTIPART\_ALTERNATIVE. That way the e-mail client can choose which to use. Of course the HTML would have to be striped for the text body. Or is this getting into more than is worth? :D Will attach a new patch with this feature. Are these patches close to what you were thinking?

 

 

Posted by Brian DeShong (bdeshong) on 2008-06-24T07:50:01.000+0000

Also, I see that this issue tracker ticket was opened in May 2007, while I proposed Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Mail in January 2008.

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Log_Writer_Mail)

Maybe there's some overlap here; just wanted to point out the parallel thinking going on in this area.

 

 

Posted by Ryan Panning (panman) on 2008-06-24T07:52:27.000+0000

Changes since my last patch:

- Removed html data member
- Added feature to auto add html body and text body
 


 

Posted by Ryan Panning (panman) on 2008-08-06T07:13:36.000+0000

New file uploaded, changes since first file:

- Changed E-mail Template to Zend\_Layout
- Removed Dependency of Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Mock

What is the diff in functionality between this patch and the proposal? I'd like to coordinate efforts, if possible.

 

 

Posted by Ryan Panning (panman) on 2008-12-04T13:39:45.000+0000

Nothing from what I can tell, just coded a little differently. The latest proposal skeleton class has the same features, and more. At least between the patch that I created, Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Mail-Layout.txt.

 

 

Posted by Brian DeShong (bdeshong) on 2008-12-04T13:40:59.000+0000

Hey Wil,

Good question! I'll summarize the main differences below. My proposal:

1) ...allows for two formatters -- one for the plaintext entries, and one for the HTML entries. This allows you to end the HTML entries with, say, a "  
" or any other appropriate line ending, rather than forcing the user into ending with line break tags.

2) ...allows for the message subject to be appended with the summary of errors per-error level, if the caller provided "subject prepend text."

3) ...catches Zend\_Mail exceptions and re-throws them at the proper level of abstraction

Originally, the class in this big report extended Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Mock, which I did not agree with. As in the revised version of this bug report, it, too, now extends Zend\_Log\_Writer\_abstract.

I also never actually saw the second file attached to this bug report until today, so I didn't notice some of those similar decisions. There is quite a bit of overlap between the patches here and my proposal, though personally, I tend to think that mine's a bit more "ready for primetime" as the proposal is now "Ready for Recommendation."

Let me know if you'd like any further feedback or thoughts. Thanks for taking the time to consider these two options!

Reassigning to Brian, since he has a proposal here: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Log_Writer_Mail)
