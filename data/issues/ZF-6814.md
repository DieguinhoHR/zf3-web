### Description

Hi All,

I just followed the zend framework tutorials and tried the example. But It doesn't work. So I traced the bug till it reached the line 772 " $metadata = $this->\_db->describeTable($this->\_name, $this->\_schema); " in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Apparently, it calls a abstract method "abstract public function describeTable($tableName, $schemaName = null); " , here the $tableName is guestbook and $schemaName is null. My logging information stopped at this line. I think an exception was thrown out. but I cann't trace further because it's abstract.

My question is where the implementation of this abstract describeTable() or where we overwrite this method. Thanks in advance.

It seems to be tutorial's issue.

I think you could run the example successfully if you would specify the schema in factory method of the Zend\_Db.
