### Description

Its impossible to extend Zend\_Application with additional plugin loader paths or plugins from configuration.

You would have to change the code that initializes Zend\_Application to mainipulate the PluginLoader.

However for re-use you dont always wan't to use the "\_init" syntax, but add your own classes.

I propose to add a new options namespace:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    bootstrap.pluginloader.doctrine2.prefix = "Zend_Doctrine2_Application_Resource_"
    bootstrap.pluginloader.doctrine2.path = "Zend/Doctrine2/Application/Resource"


Inside Zend\_Application then one would add the additional paths to the plugin loader bootstrap.

Actually, you _can_ provide additional bootstrap resource plugin paths:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    pluginpaths.Zend_Doctrine2_Application_Resource = "Zend/Doctrine2/Application/Resource"


Does this not work for you?

This doesn't seem to work with namespaced (PHP 5.3) classes. I could be missing something but I have tried the following:

pluginPaths.core\\bootstrap\\resource = SOURCE\_PATH "/library/core/bootstrap/resource"

<?php

namespace core\\bootstrap\\resource; use \\Zend\_Application\_Resource\_ResourceAbstract as AbstractResource;

class Whatever extends AbstractResource {}

So, as I suspected...I was doing something wrong.

this: pluginPaths.core\\bootstrap\\resource = SOURCE\_PATH "/library/core/bootstrap/resource"

should be (ending backslash): pluginPaths.core\\bootstrap\\resource\\ = SOURCE\_PATH "/library/core/bootstrap/resource"

pluginPaths.Zend\_Doctrine2\_Application\_Resource = "Zend/Doctrine2/Application/Resource"

works perfectly
