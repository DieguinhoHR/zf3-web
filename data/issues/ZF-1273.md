### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached should be names Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcache...

As is uses a memory cache and not "it is memory cached". Otherwise the other classes should be names equal like Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_APCed or \_Filed and this would be nonsense.

This is not a case of changing a verb to its past participle form.

In this case the class name refers to a specific technology product called "Memcached". See <http://www.danga.com/memcached/>

The memcached product runs as a daemon and therefore it's spelled with a 'd' at the end, like httpd, ftpd, named, etc.

The Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached class utilizes the PHP memcache extension. See <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.memcache.php>

If any change should be made, it should to rename the PHP extension. It should be called "memcached" instead of its current "memcache". :-)

And I just found out what was the problem for jan and me... the translated manual spoke about memcache... so someone erased the "d" ;-) I will fix this in my next commit.

Thanx bill for your response.
