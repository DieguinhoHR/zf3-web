### Description

We have documentation for the general Zend\_Filter and Zend\_Validate interfaces, but no docs for specific classes.

This is a request to add sections to the manual (e.g. Zend\_Filter-Classes.xml and Zend\_Validate-Classes.xml) to document each of the supported filter and validate concrete classes.

Thanks to [~andries] for committing [SVN r5104](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=5104) as first documentation for the filter classes. Initial documentation for the validation classes is coming soon.
