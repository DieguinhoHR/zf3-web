ZF-7963: Zend\_Acl::isAllowed() fails on all privilegs after a privilege has set up

### Description

The following code does not behave as I do expect:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl = new Zend_Acl();
            
    $acl->addResource('profile');
    $acl->addRole('user');
            
    $acl->deny('user', 'profile', 'edit');        
    $acl->allow('user', 'profile');
            
    var_dump($acl->isAllowed('user', 'profile'));


outputs: {quote}false{quote}

I would expect that 'user' is allowed to access 'profile'. Is there a bug? If I investigate the $acl object I see that index ["allPrivileges"] is set to type "TYPE\_ALLOW" And if I comment out the line with the deny on the edit privilege I get true. I think it is quite strange...

This is not odd. When you ask "$acl->isAllowed('user', 'profile')" you are asking if the user has access to the profile regardless of the privileged. The answer to this is "no", since there is at least once privilege the user doesn't have access to: "edit".

When using privileges, this: $acl->isAllowed('user', 'profile') is like saying this: $acl->isAllowed('user', 'profile', '\*'), where \* is a wildcard.

Ralph, thank you for your answer.

But on my logic if I use $acl->allow('user', 'profile') it should override any denies on ('user','profile'), isn't? Following your logic I guess $acl->allow('user', 'profile') should mean $acl->allow('user', 'profile','\*'), and it definitely should override the previous denies with any privileges.

What is wrong with my assumption?
