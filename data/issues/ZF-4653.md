### Description

Hello, i integrate zend lucene in my symfony application and i try to searching word... i have see that if i try to search a single character whith a wilcards (for example: a\*) zend search lucene broke... I try to understand if this is only my problem or if is a zend\_search\_lucene problem, and i've try on your zend framework site: <http://framework.zend.com/>

if you search "a\*" the result is a blank page.... [http://framework.zend.com/search/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/search?query=a*&language=en&type=all&x=17&y=19)

in a devzone too: <http://devzone.zend.com/search/results?q=a>\*

This is because default behavior of Zend\_Search\_Lucene throws an exception if you search with wildcard character not followed by 3 non wild card characters.

You should catch this exception and handle it.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    // Fail
    $results = $index->find("a*"); //At least 3 non-wildcard characters are required at the beginning of pattern.
    
    //Fail
    $results = $index->find("aa*"); //At least 3 non-wildcard characters are required at the beginning of pattern.
    
    //SUCCESS
    $results = $index->find("aaa*");

Works as designed. Exception is thrown due to 3 non wildcard characters before wildcard.
