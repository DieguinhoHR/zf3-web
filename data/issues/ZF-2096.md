### Description

I recently met that situation. Impossible to get anything from my cache while things looked all right... ?

I noticed that the disk where cached filed are stored was full.

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File should use some kind of disk\_free\_space() uses to figure out if it is possible to write data safely. And if not, an exception should be thrown.

Isn't this more an issue for a low level disk storage class rather than the cache class in particular?

I agree with Steven.

And I suppose that Zend\_Cache save() method return (silently) false in such cases.

If you don't want to check result values from Zend\_Cache methods, you can also set the logging directive to on and use Zend\_Log mechanism to throw an Exception at a given error level
