This unfortunately does not care of the problem. Please correct the class or give a specific solution. Functionality was tested on Zend\_Server 5.2 and 5.3. On Windows XP or Gentoo. Why is this functionality does not work. How can you let something like this, especially since this problem occurs in almost all versions of Zend Framework.
