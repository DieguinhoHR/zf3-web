### Description

A new option should be added to allow parsing of all subdirectories from a given one for source files.

Mainly this is intended to allow old gettext structures to be used within the gettext adapter without the need to extend it.

So additionally to the "scanDirectory" option the new option "scanSubDirectories" allows the directory to be named like

/_/"locale"/_/... which means all found source file in that sub-directory are included in this locale.
