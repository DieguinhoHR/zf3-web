### Description

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $string   = str_repeat('foobarblahblahblah baz bat', 4);
    $header   = $this->getMock('Zend\Mail\Header\UnstructuredInterface');
    $expected = "=?UTF-8?Q?foobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20bat?=\r\n"
              . " =?UTF-8?Q?foobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20bat?=";
    
    $test = \Zend\Mime\Mime::encodeQuotedPrintableHeader($string, 'UTF-8', 78);
    $this->assertEquals($expected, $test);


Expects:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    =?UTF-8?Q?foobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20bat?=
     =?UTF-8?Q?foobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20bat?=


Actual:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    =?UTF-8?Q?foobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20?=
     =?UTF-8?Q?batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20batfoobarblahblahblah=20baz=20?=
     =?UTF-8?Q?bat?=

The word bat is concatenated with foobarblahblahblah so is correct move the word to a separate line
