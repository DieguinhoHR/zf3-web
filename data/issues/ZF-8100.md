### Description

Hi,

I have a process which will check for a file on a remote server.

The domain given to me already has the www subdomain stripped but the problem I have is when domain.com is not accessible but <www.domain.com> is.

This is what I've tried, but it has failed on the 3rd line and does not process anything after: {quote} $url='<http://domain.com>'; $client = new Zend\_Http\_Client($url, array('maxredirects' => 0)); $response = $client->request('GET'); if (!$response) : $url='<http://www>.' . $messagebody['url']; $client = new Zend\_Http\_Client($url, array('maxredirects' => 0)); $response = $client->request('GET'); endif; {quote} The error I get is: bq. Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception' with message 'Unable to Connect to <a>tcp://xxxxxx.xxx:80</a>. Error #0: php\_network\_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known' in /home/sites/ZendFramework/ZendFramework-1.9.4/library/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php:213

Unless I'm missing something, this is the expected behavior.

If the address is not resolvable (as in this case, at least according to the error message), there's nothing Zend\_Http\_Client can do (it's not a 404 error - it's not in the HTTP level).

The best practice is to wrap your code in a try / catch clause:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $url='<a href="http://domain.com">http://domain.com</a>';
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client($url, array('maxredirects' => 0));
    try {
      $response = $client->request('GET');
      if (!$response) :
      // ...
    } catch (Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Exception $e) {
      // handle the error
    }
