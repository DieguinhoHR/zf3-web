### Description

Hi,

I'm trying to use the sorting mechanism of Zend\_Search\_Lucene from following documentation: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.searching.html#zend.search.lucene.searching.sorting)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open(path/to/lucene);
    $list = $index->find("12","id", SORT_NUMERIC, SORT_DESC);   


Result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception' with message 'Wrong field name.' in /home/httpd/tools/library/Zend-1.7.5/Search/Lucene.php:935


When I watch on that line and print some output like these

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!in_array($fieldName, $fieldNames)) {
       echo "


    ";
        print_r($fieldName);
        echo "

    ";
        die();
        throw new Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception('Wrong field name.');
    }
    
    result:
    SORT_NUMERIC

SORT\_NUMERIC isn't a field but a sorting type...

Note: Searching with following code works (without sorting)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open(path/to/lucene);
    $list = $index->find("12");

'id' is not actually a field in terms of index structure and currently not supported for result set sorting. But it's good idea to add it.

This is still an issue in v1.8.0PR. Any idea when this will be fixed?
