### Description

When you add an object of Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup to the Zend\_Form it will not remove the elements in Zend\_Form. When rendering the form, it will render the elements twice. (in the decorator FormElements of Zend\_Form and the in the decorator for the Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup)

testcase: (it will render the element `test` twice)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $oForm = new Zend_Form();
    $oForm->addElement('text','test');
            
    $oDisplayGroup = new Zend_Form_DisplayGroup('bug',$oForm->getPLuginLoader('decorator'));
    $oDisplayGroup->addElement($oForm->getElement('test'));
    $oForm->addDisplayGroups(array($oDisplayGroup));
    echo $oForm;


solution: add following code in \_addDisplayGroupObject in Zend\_Form (it will remove the elements from the ordering in Zend\_Form, so they won't be rendered)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($group->getElements() as $element) {
        unset($this->_order[$element->getName()]);
    }

Can you detail:

- What are your expectations? In other words, when you perform X, you expect Y to happen.
- What actually happens? In other words, when you perform X, you expect Y to happen, but instead Z happens.

Your report presents a solution, but it doesn't clearly state what the problem is. It's entirely possible that it's by design, but we cannot be certain until we have this information.

Thanks!

Issue ZF-11729 is a duplicate of this and is resolved/fixed.
