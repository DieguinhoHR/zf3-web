ZF-5873: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector kills the session

### Description

In the redirectAndExit() method in the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector class the session is closed. This causes problems when the session needs to be available in a function that is registered as a shutdown function.

An option should be available so the session is not closed automatically.

The following patch implements an option that be be used to skip closing of the session. The default is to close it. The patch has been made against revision 14153 of [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/Redirector.php).

This patch adds a test method that tests the setting/getting of the new option. The patch is made against the same revision as the other patch.

That sounds good to me. We already talk about this on the ML and agree with this new behavior. Letting default to do the close to avoid the php writing session bug on redirect.

cogo nice work. Just a reminder, since this implements some new functionality, please do not merge to the 1.7 release branch; the fix will need to wait to release until 1.8.
