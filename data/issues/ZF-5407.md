### Description

This is a clone of issue #1850 ... which I'm sure will annoy a few people but hopefully it'll get some attention since that issue was first reporter over a year ago, plus I couldn't comment on it. It's flagged as "Trivial" for Priority which isn't appropriate considering it breaks some important functionality.

It's not specific to IIS (as #1850 states), but rather all cookies.
