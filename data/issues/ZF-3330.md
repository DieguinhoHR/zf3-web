### Description

There's probably no need to keep identical \_\_toString() methods in Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle and its parent Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Standalone classes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->toString();
    }


Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle::\_\_toString() can be removed.
