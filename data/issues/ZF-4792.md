That's a good idea. I have some schemas in french , also, UML sequence diagrams are very nice for such a task.

Thorsten Ruf has published a great diagram that should be perfect for this improvement: [http://nethands.de/download/zenddispatch\_en.pdf](http://nethands.de/download/zenddispatch_en.pdf) We are currently waiting for his CLA before adding it to the documentation.

CLA is already signed and approved.

@Thorsten, yep, aware of that. Trying to determine how we're going to drop it in. It's larger in width than the current diagram, but we don't want to shrink it, either.
