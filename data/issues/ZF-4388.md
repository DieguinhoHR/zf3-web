### Description

I created a form with a File element which is set to not required

After submitting the form i received Validation Error "File '' not found"

In Zend\_File\_Abstract on line ~580 if ($this->\_options['ignoreNoFile'] and (isset($fileerrors['fileUploadErrorNoFile']))) { unset($fileerrors['fileUploadErrorNoFile']); }

Here it is still continuing to validate; After changing this to if ($this->\_options['ignoreNoFile'] and (isset($fileerrors['fileUploadErrorNoFile']))) { unset($fileerrors['fileUploadErrorNoFile']);

 
                      break;
                    }


Validation was working as expected.

I didnt find where to add a new Comment so i am editing this issue. I am using the Zf trunk.

class Form\_Profile extends Cms\_Form { public function init() { $Language = Zend\_Registry::get('language');

 
        /* Create Form Elements */
        $UploadLogo         = $this->createElement('file', 'UploadLogo');
    
        /* Add Labels */
        $UploadLogo             ->setLabel($Language->label->UploadLogo);
    
        $UploadLogo->setDestination('./upload/company_logos/image')  
                                 ->addValidator('Count', false, 1)     // ensure only 1 file 
                                 ->addValidator('Size', false, 102400) // limit to 100K
                                 ->addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif');  // only JPEG, PNG, and GIFs    
    
        /* Add Elements to Object */
        $this   ->addElement($OldImage); 
    }


}

Cms\_Form is extending the Zend\_Dojo\_Form Language is just an ini file where i am keeping my messages and config is also ini

In the controller i am using

if ($this->\_request->isPost()) { $formData = $this->\_request->getPost();

 
        if ($form->isValid($formData)) { // here i am getting the message "File '' not found"
            .... processing the data
            if($form->UploadLogo->receive()) {
               ....  saving the file to database changing the name etc....
            }
         }


}

file not found is comiing as a validation message after submitting and not uploading a file

Added setRequired(false);

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $UploadLogo->setDestination($this->CONFIG->paths->company_logo)
                       ->addValidator('Count', false, 1)     // ensure only 1 file
                       ->addValidator('Size', false, 102400) // limit to 100K
                       ->addValidator('Extension', false, $this->CONFIG->images->allowed_images)
                       ->setRequired(false);


After calling isValid receiving the Validation Message "File '' not found";

The ignoreNoFile option is set on the Adapter as expected but it is continuing to Validate and assigning error messages in the Zend\_File\_Adapter\_Abstract

ignoreNoFile does not work for ZF 1.6

Please give code for reproduction

setRequired is a option of Zend\_Form. Zend\_File\_Transfer does not know what you set to Zend\_Form. If you know that a file can be optional you have to set the option "ignoreNoFile" on the adapter.

I see no problem at all.

When you add a

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ->setRequired(false)


to the file element the validation is ignored as it's expected.

The file element even adds the "ignoreNoFile" Option for you on the adapter. Just add this single line to your code and all works perfect

Works on my side with your code and the additional line. It returns no validation failure.

Maybe simply a broken file ? Update your repository and look again.

Closing issue due to non-response.
