ZF-9191: allow recursive loading of config file
-----------------------------------------------

### Description

With Zend\_Application you can load additional configuration files via

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    config.subconfig = "subconfig.ini"


Currently it is not possible to load a sub sub configuration file. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    config.subsubconfig = "subsubconfig.ini"


configuration file subsubconfig.ini will not be charged.

It would be interesting to implement this recursive loading.

I have quick workaround for this. bq. $application = new Zend\_Application( APPLICATION\_ENV, APPLICATION\_PATH . '/configs/application.ini' );

// Workaround for 2-level recursive including of config files $application->setOptions($application->getOptions());

$application->bootstrap() ->run(); It includes at least subsubconfig file, but not subsubsubconfig files... you will have to call $application->setOptions($application->getOptions()); on time for each sub config file level greater than one.
