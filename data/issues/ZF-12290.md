ZF-12290: Broken matching of a route in case of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain and custom chain separator

### Description

In case when there is defined a chain with custom separator routes using view helper are generated correctly but they are not handled by router. This is mostly because of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route uses always standard url delimiter ('/'). In that case it would have to be delimiter defined in chain function. Sadly chaining routes is the only way to make translation of routes in case of custom format or URL's (where Route\_Regex is used).

This bug occurs with this simple code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $firstRoute  = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('foo');
    $secondRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('bar', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index'));
    $chainedRoute = $firstRoute->chain($secondRoute, '-');
    $router->addRoute('example', $chainedRoute);


Using Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url helper for generating the url in partial:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->url(array(), 'example');


Will output foo-bar

After using this url in browser it's not valid. Expected is calling the IndexController:indexAction(), but it forwards to ErrorController with message that foo-bar controller does not exist.
