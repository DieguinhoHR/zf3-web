ZF-6749: Multiple values with the same key for a Zend\_Rest\_Client call doesn't work
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If you have the following example of a REST call, the Zend\_Rest\_Client won't accept multiple values for the key (in this case "label").

[http://www......./service?label=1&label=2&label=3](/service?label=1&label=2&label=3)

It appears that the code stores the key/value pair in an array and therefore only one value for a key is allowed.

Isn't this default http behaviour?

Arthur, do you expect the label would be past to REST server as combined string, '1,2,3' ?

Dolf - I'm not sure. It's not clear to me.

Satoru - yes, something like that or better yet an array.

If you do:

$rest = new Zend\_Rest\_Client("http://localhost/"); $rest->restGet("/", array("q" => array(1, 2, 3)));

this results in a request for:

[http://localhost/?q[0]=1&q[1]=2&q[2]=3](http://localhost/?q%5B0%5D=1&q%5B1%5D=2&q%5B2%5D=3)

If the server is PHP, then $\_REQUEST["q"] will equal array(1, 2, 3). If the server isn't PHP, and you need some other array serialisation format like "q=1,2,3" or "q=1&q=2&q=3" I think you're out of luck, because restGet() will only take an array as its second parameter.

One solution would be to change restGet() to accept a string as the second argument, in which case you could construct it yourself. But in that case you don't get much benefit over using Zend\_Http\_Client directly.

According to RFC 2396 Appendix A, there's no requirement for a URL's parameters be unique, so "?q=1&q=2&q=3" is valid.
