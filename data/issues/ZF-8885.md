### Description

system: Windows 7 x64 Ultimate RC2 PHP 5.2.11 (built: Sep 16 2009 19:32:02) ZF version from trunk rev#20444

Steps to reproduce:

zf create project sample zf create action info index //error but zf create action info Index //correct

then zf create controller stock zf create action info stock // error zf create action info Stock // correct

such behavior seems to be confusing. If first char was changed while controller creation, why we can't do this in other case

Set component to "Zend\_Tool", affected version to "Next Minor Release," and assigned to Ralph.

This seems to be working in 1.10.11. I am unable to reproduce the issue. The following not was disptached to the screen when index and stock were supplied.

Note: The canonical controller name that is used with other providers is "Stock"; not "stock" as supplied Note: The canonical controller name that is used with other providers is "Index"; not "index" as supplied

While it makes sense after you think about it, there is no mention of case sensitivity in the documentation that I could find. This affects many places of Zend\_Tool.

zf create project test

cd test zf create module admin

zf create controller Index -m Admin //Fails because the module was initially created as "admin" not "Admin" Note: PHPUnit is required in order to generate controller test stubs. An Error Has Occurred  
 A controller directory for module "Admin" was not found.

zf create controller Index -m admin //Works
