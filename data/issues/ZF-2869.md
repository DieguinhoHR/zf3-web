ZF-2869: Adding Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setPost() would be big help for unit testing

### Description

Sample unit test code, which tests login controller:

$front = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $request = new Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http('<http://localhost/login>'); $request->setParams(array('login' => 'admin', 'password' => 'test')); $front->setRequest($request); $front->dispatch(); $this->assertFalse($response->isException());

Problem is when I make check in LoginController whether if data was sent via POST, because it won't see data set by $request->setParams(). Checking whether data was sent using POST is essential in web applications, and not being able to simulate post request makes in unit testing a bit hard. Using Zend\_Http for requests is not a solution because response context is lost, I would just get response body.

Cheers!

This issue is obsolete, functionality provided in 1.6.0 by Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase.
