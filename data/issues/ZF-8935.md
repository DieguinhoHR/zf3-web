ZF-8935: Zend\_Http\_Client does not support parts with empty filenames
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client::encodeFormData() does not permit you to specify a part with an empty filename (i.e. one that looks like 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="..."; filename=""'). If you pass '' as the fourth argument, it'll just chop off the '; filename=""' part. This issue caused an ASP/IIS application that I was fetching from to break, as it was expecting the '; filename=""' part to be present in the request.

I am attaching a patch that fixes this, so that if you specify '' as the fourth function argument, it'll include the '; filename=""' part, whereas specifying null will cause the '; filename=""' part to be left off.
