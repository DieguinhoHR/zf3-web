### Description

Zend\_InfoCard seems to be expecting the enc: prefix for the <http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc>\# namespace, even when the submitted XML token assigns a different prefix (such as xenc: ) to that namespace. This causes Zend\_InfoCard to fail to parse a submitted information card token from card selectors other than Microsoft Cardspace.

Since there are several other card selectors available has there been any movement on this fix? Besides the enc (to xenc) issue there are others related to the namespaces.

Fixed in r24374 and ZF2 hotfix branch.

Sorry for the long wait! It only needed a quick patch to register the namespace for XPath so the default prefix was not relied on.
