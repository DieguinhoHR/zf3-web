### Description

This is my code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $this->data['Birthday'] = "19760213T12:00:00";
    
        $locale    = new Zend_Locale('de_DE');
        $bday_date = Zend_Locale_Format::getDate(
                        $this->data['Birthday'],
                        array(
                            'date_format' => 'yyyyMMdd h:m:s', //Zend_Locale_Format::STANDARD,
                            'locale' => $locale
                        )
        );


This is the result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(6) {
      ["date_format"] => string(14) "yyyyMMdd h:m:s"
      ["locale"] => object(Zend_Locale)#176 (2) {
        ["_Locale:private"] => string(5) "de_DE"
        ["_Codeset:private"] => NULL
      }
      ["year"] => string(8) "19760213"
      ["month"] => string(2) "12"
      ["day"] => string(2) "00"
      ["hour"] => string(2) "00"
    }


I tried all variations in the format part - I can't get it to work.

(As of "Affects Version" - we are on SVN from 2 days ago.)

Zend\_Locale\_Format is not able to normalize non localized dates.

The SQL Format you gave is not a localized date... it's already normalized. I am not sure for what you need the output from Zend\_Locale\_Format for your code, but you should use Zend\_Date which is able to work with the SQL format if you are in need to work with this format.

PS: The Zend\_Locale\_Format::STANDARD is NOT yyyyMMdd h:m:s as mentioned in your example !!!

Just fyi: I didn't mention anything. I just commented it out and forgot to not copy it over to Jira.

I understand that the date is not a localized date - fine, I am not sure why though I provided an exact string (yyyyMMdd h:m:s) to match/parse and it does not work. Should it not work regardless, or what's the catch here? For sure I'll look into Zend\_Date.

The date I provided is not an SQL date, it's supplied by the API of Apple's Addressbook.

Also, did you still implement a fix (1.0.0 RC3)?

The reason is simple...

Localized dates always have a sort of seperator within them... a blank, a colon or something else...

yyyyMMdd does not have a seperator nor is it localized. Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate() is not meant to seperate every date string into it's parts. It was created as helper-function for Zend\_Date. But Zend\_Date has this abilities to seperate automatically.

I tried to make an improvement for this as this is an additional feature and not a problem in my eyes. But it's not that easy... changing it to allow non-seperated localized dates breaks several other tests.

Not sure if this can be solved until RC3.
