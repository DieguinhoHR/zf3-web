### Description

When using the new RewriteRouter and trying to do a redirect by calling $this->\_redirect('/controller/action/') the redirect method should check if a RewriteBase is set and prepend it to the URL. It could look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Redirect to another URL
     *
     * @param string $url
     */
    final protected function _redirect($url)
    {
            if (headers_sent()) {
                throw new Zend_Controller_Action_Exception('Cannot redirect because headers have already been sent.');
            }
            
            // add RewriteBase when RewriteRouter is used
        $router = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRouter();
        if ($router instanceof Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter) {
            $url = $router->getRewriteBase() . $url;
        }
            
        // prevent header injections
            $url = str_replace(array("\n", "\r"), '', $url);
            
            // redirect
            header("Location: $url");
            exit();
    }


There should also be some checks with trailing slashes.

Assigning to Matthew, lead on Controller components.

With the new MVC, Response object may pull the BaseURL out of Request for redirection purposes. I personally would like to see a flag (as a second parameter for example) where user can choose whether to compute a relative redirect (using baseURL) or to craft it from scratch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function redirect($url, $clean = false) 
    {
       ...
       if (!$clean)  {
          $base = $this->getRequest()->getBaseURL();
          $url = $base . $url;
       }
       ...
    }

Functionality added in revision 1901. New prototype is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _redirect($url, $code = 302, $prependBase = true);


If $prependBase is true and the $url is relative, prepends the base URL as found in the request object to the $url prior to redirecting.
