### Description

I have not seen any feedback on my compromise solution suggested below. We should come to a resolution on this issue, before the approaching release of 0.7. <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-735>

I am not in favor of automatically using default values for the session names, since various issues have been identified with that approach. I would like to push for a solution _requiring_ the developer to explicitly specify either a value or explicitly choose to use the default from php.ini, as follows:

Zend\_Session\_Core::setOptions( array( 'id' => $uniqueZfId, 'name' => Zend\_Session\_Core::PHP\_INI\_SESSION\_NAME // or // 'name' => $uniqueZfId ));

If these two options are not set before the session is started, an exception would be thrown.

Is everyone comfortable with requiring these two options? Does anyone have an alternative that helps detect/prevent collisions of sessions between ZF apps on the same domain, allows Zend\_Session\_Core to use php.ini's session name, and does not automatically default to a potentially unexpected value?

At the same time, I see great value in requiring the developer to assign a unique id to each ZF application that uses Zend\_Session, so that Zend\_Session\_Core can automatically detect collisions between ZF apps using Zend\_Session. This might be somewhat controversial, and I'm hoping for feedback. Thoughts?

Cheers, Gavin

The "normal" situation with ext/session leads to all sorts of problems for some. The alternatives discussed in this thread mostly relate to ways to minimize the risks of defaults that can easily lead to non-obvious problems in practice. I still believe requiring ZF developers to explicitly set the session.name (and save\_path, if they are using the default save handler) offers the best alternative.

While has suited the needs of the procedural programmer in the past quite nicely, I feel like it on its own falls short when it comes to OOP applications, and modules that wish to consume it. To get a broader understanding of where sessions fit in the web-application world, I looked towards other projects like rails and django to see how they attacked the problem.

In context of Zend\_Session (and most session implementations), we are specifically talking about the session name, or cookie name and the data location.

It would have all the required options in one place to make it easy (is it just these two?). And there is always setOptions() for very specific needs.

Over the last couple weeks, nobody has voiced a preference on this, other than "status quo".

So, even though I believe a strong case can be made that best practice calls for the developer specifically choose a correct, unique session name (session.name php.ini setting) for each ZF app, at this time we are not going to force the developer to set this. Instead, we will default to using the value from php.ini, replete with the problems that all PHP apps have when they do so, including security issues when two or more PHP web applications share the same session name and the same domain name.
