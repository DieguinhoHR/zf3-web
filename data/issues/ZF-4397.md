### Description

Hi,

It would be very useful to have a possibility of having this while using with AJAX requests, i.e. when AJAX request is invoked then two fields are set in $\_SERVER: HTTP\_REFERER and [HTTP\_X\_REQUESTED\_WITH] => XMLHttpRequest

and HTTP\_REFERER contains the original page URI that is in browser. This is useful when I am having tabs that are being fed with HTML AJAX output and I want to render the proper viewscript basing on the page that I am really on (and not on the request itself where I don't have the information about the controller/action that is requesting by AJAX)

A sample implementation in the Controller's init():

 
    if (isset($_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"])){
      preg_match('#<a rel="nofollow" href="http://[^/]+/">http://[^/]+/</a>([^/]+)/([^/]+)/(.+)#',$_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"],$matches);
      $params = array();
      foreach ((array)split("/",$matches[3]) as $val){
        if (isset($param)) {
          $param[key($param)] = $val;
          $params[] = $param;
          unset($param);
        }else {
          $param = array($val=>null);
        }  
      }
      $this->origRequest["controller"] = $matches[1];
      $this->origRequest["action"] = $matches[2];
      $this->origRequest["params"] = $params;
    }
