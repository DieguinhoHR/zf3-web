ZF-8409: Zend\_Filter\_StripTags strips '<' in text
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-11-27T06:09:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-28T18:38:40.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.7 (11/Jan/10)

### Description

When using the Zend\_Filter\_StripTags it will strip starting from a single '<'.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $text = 'This is an example. Bla < 300';
    $filter = new Zend_Filter_StripTags();
    $filteredText = $filter->filter($text);
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($filteredText);


The result:" string(24) "This is an example. Bla "

Why is the < (and the part after) removed? It isn't a tag.

This is expected behaviour and even tested to get sure it is done this way.

Only &gt; or &lt; is allowed.

Closing as non-issue

May I ask why?

So i first have to replace all the &, <, > (not tags) before using striptags?

Sven, StripTags is intended to strip anything that could be interpreted as an HTML tag. Since "< 300" could be an unclosed html tag, the logical action is to strip that character and everything that follows.

To protect against user input containing HTML, you are better off to store the raw input (without implementing the StripTags filter) and then escape via [htmlentities](http://us3.php.net/htmlentities) when later displaying that content.
