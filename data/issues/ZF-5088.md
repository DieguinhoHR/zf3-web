Hi, Alberto.

You can login SVN repository? There is Zend\_Form-Introduction.xml in 2 places for version 1.7.x

1) [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/documentation/manual/es/module_specs/Zend_Form-Introduction.xml) .

2) [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.7/documentation/manual/es/module_specs/Zend_Form-Introduction.xml) .

I hope it will help You.

Hi Satoru.

I don't have acces to the SVN.

I have the translation from trunk, is the more recent. This is wrong?

Hi, Alberto.

It is correct. You can translate from English version in trunk. [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/documentation/manual/en/module_specs)

The English version in trunk is master document.

Hi, Alberto.

Sorry if you have already known in following.

If you want to release new document from 1.7.2, you should also commit to branches/release-1.7/documentation/manual/es/module-specs .

But If you want to release from 1.8 (or bigger), you may only commit to trunk/documentation/manual/es/module-specs .

Have a good days!
