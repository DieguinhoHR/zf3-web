ZF-5910: Zend\_PDF Date Metadata Has Extra Apostrophe

### Description

Zend\_PDF recommends an extra apostrophe in the Date metadata fields. This extra apostrophe does not exist in the official PDF standard.

According to the latest PDF standard, this is the format of CreationDate and ModDate:

D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm

HH followed by APOSTROPHE (U+0027) (') shall be the absolute value of the offset from UT in hours (00-23) mm shall be the absolute value of the offset from UT in minutes (00-59)

...The APOSTROPHE following the hour offset field (HH) shall only be present if the HH field is present. The minute offset field (mm) shall only be present if the APOSTROPHE following the hour offset field (HH) is present...

...For example, December 23, 1998, at 7:52 PM, U.S. Pacific Standard Time, is represented by the string D : 199812231952-08'00

Whereas the Zend\_PDF Documentation says: D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm' HH followed by ' is the absolute value of the offset from UT in hours (00-23). mm followed by ' is the absolute value of the offset from UT in minutes (00-59).

I don't know what the Zend\_PDF documentation source is, but I guess it's an older version of the PDF standard.
