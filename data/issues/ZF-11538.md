### Description

I am working with zend studio. I am using zend firefox toolbar for debug. Everything worked fine until today. At a certain debugging session I was asked unexpectedly to select local debugging resource. After selecting local debugging resource and setting a breakpoint on a function I started getting the following faulr response from the server:

Class "servicesEP" does not exist: Plugin by name 'ServicesEP' was not found in the registry; used paths:

Please note that if I do not set breakpoint the application works correctly and I do not get any error messages.

My first question is? Why this error message My second question is: is there a way to change the setting to local resouce zend debugger is now pointing? I tried to reset the project, restart zend studio and restart the machine but no way.

This is the second time I report a bug regarding this error: The first time Igot this error deploying an application to a server, but unfortunately the problem was not solved.

Hi, paolo anghileri.

I recommend You to ask Zend Technology how to fix. This issue is not Zend Framework issue, I think.
