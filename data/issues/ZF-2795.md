Works for me OK on windows with 5.2.4. Maybe ext/json missing?

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-03-04T12:48:01.000+0000

No, ext/json is enabled on the system of the issue description.

Strange... Can you reproduce it with 5.2.x?

Running it on 5.2.5 I get no such failure; all tests pass.
