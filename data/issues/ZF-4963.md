ZF-4963: Zend\_Locale::isLocale evaluates int 0 to a locale
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-11-17T08:41:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-21T05:57:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.1 (01/Dec/08)

### Description

When the function isLocale is called from within the Translate view helper it will evaluate an integer 0 to a locale thus causing the vsprintf to fail when utilizing this to be sent for evaluation.

This broke BC between 1.6.2 and 1.7.

Reproduction: in a view script $this->translate('something %s', 0); which will now throw an exception because 0 became a locale due to the Zend\_Locale::isLocale handling. This might be more of a bug in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate more than anything. Please see the view helper fix below.

Likely in the view helper itself, it should call strict since it is evaluating the result (patch):

0, 1 and '' are no longer accepted as locale for validation.
