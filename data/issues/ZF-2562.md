### Description

Currently, Zend\_Form has only concrete classes. For issues of composition and extendibility, we should have one or more interfaces which can be used to create alternate implementations.

The interfaces became too bloated and complex to be usable. While there were a finite number of methods required for each, there were also issues with multiple interfaces interfering with each other (e.g., Iterator, Zend\_Form\_Interface), and the fact that Zend\_Form itself implemented all but the Element and DisplayGroup interfaces in order to keep the current API.

Closing as "Won't Fix".
