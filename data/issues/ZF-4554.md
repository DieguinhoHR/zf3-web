### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_GdataOnlineTest::testPostRetrieveEntryAndDelete is failing on my machine:

 
    <pre class="highlight">testPostRetrieveEntryAndDelete(Zend_Gdata_GdataOnlineTest)
    Zend_Gdata_App_HttpException: Unable to read response, or response is empty
    library/Zend/Gdata/App.php:483
    library/Zend/Gdata.php:201
    library/Zend/Gdata/App.php:610
    library/Zend/Gdata/App.php:541
    library/Zend/Gdata/App.php:159
    library/Zend/Gdata.php:169

I'm tracked the breakage to r11768. I'm currently attempting to isolate the cause.

Attaching packet capture.

This part is interesting:

 
    <pre class="highlight">No.     Time        Source                Destination           Protocol Info

It seems that my client begins a request, the server ACKs, and then nothing happens for 20 seconds until my client sends a FIN.

(172.19.246.207 = me, 209.85.133.191 = remote server)

Alright, it seems that there's a problem has to do with the Content-Length HTTP header.

If, in Zend\_Http\_Client, I change:

 
    const CONTENT_LENGTH = 'Content-Length';


to:

 
    const CONTENT_LENGTH = 'content-length';


then the test passes. (This would be a partial revert of r11768.)

Moving to component Zend\_Http\_Client.

The problem was that Zend\_Http\_Client's internal header's array is indexed by lowercase header names, regardless of the actual header. The changes in r11768 were looking up headers using a non-normalized name, which would always fail.

Fixed in r11857.

Fixed also for the 1.6.2 (r11880).

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
