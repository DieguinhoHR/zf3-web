### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper uses request URI as cache id. It generates an exception.

cache id is generated at library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper.php:157

The exception came from Zend\_Cache\_Core "Invalid id or tag '/mycontroller/myaction' : must use only [a-zA-Z0-9\_]"

Patched in SVN - it's actually an issue with Zend\_Cache\_Core but cannot be refactored at this time. Instead the ID is now encoded to hexadecimal (hexdec()) to bypass the ID check and converted back using pack() on the other side.
