### Description

In current online manual, it is written: {quote}setImgDir($imgDir) and getImgDir() allow you to specify the directory in which captcha images are stored. This defaults to "./images/captcha/", which should look _relative to the bootstrap script_.{quote} (source: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.captcha.adapters.html#zend.captcha.adapters.image))

When I created './images/captcha' relative to bootstrap script (ie. /application/images/captcha), it did not solve the problem. However when I created './images/captcha' relative to public folder (ie. /public/images/captcha), it worked and captcha got generated.

=> default path does not seem to be relative to bootstrap script but to public folder

By default it's relative to the current directory, which usually would be bootstrap directory unless it was changed since bootstrap. I'd recommend to set the directory explicitly if unsure.
