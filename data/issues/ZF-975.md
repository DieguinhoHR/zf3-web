### Description

The rowCount() method in the Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli class assumes that rowCount() should return the number of rows in a result set. This method is intended to also return the number of rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

Please use mysqli\_affected\_rows() instead of the metadata row\_num from the result set of a SELECT.

Implementation is complete in revision 3639. All Zend\_Db unit tests pass using the Mysqli adapter.
