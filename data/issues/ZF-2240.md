ZF-2240: Zend\_Config\_Xml can't find extended nodes (possibly only when empty)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-11-26T21:22:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:14:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.3 (30/Nov/07)

### Description

When using a file such as this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>

and loading it with Zend\_Config\_XML:

// Add Routes from config files $router = $front->getRouter(); $router->addConfig( new Zend\_Config\_Xml( 'config.xml', 'development' ), 'routes' );

it produces an exception: exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Exception' with message 'No route configuration in section 'routes'' in /example/zend/library/Zend/Controller/Router/Rewrite.php:129

Running:

%svn update -r 6838 zend/library/Zend/Config

clears up the issue so the problem was introduced in revision 6906.

Looking at the source it my be due to the changes in the \_toArray() method which assumes a node with no children is a string. My node has no children. Though this probably won't be the normal case I would think it should still work.

This is a better patch. the last one causes NOTICE errors:
