### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector is used for all about HTTP redirection ( aka Location header and 30x codes) However, the HTTP protocol defines a header that can be used to delay the Refreshness of a client. Here is a simple PHP example :

header('Refresh: 3; url= <http://www.mysite.com/mypage/> ');

Redirector should be given a way to use that.
