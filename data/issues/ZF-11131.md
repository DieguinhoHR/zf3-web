ZF-11131: autoloaderNamespaces in application.ini throws warnings
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If autoloaderNamespaces is added to application.ini, then the following warning is thrown:

Warning: Missing argument 2 for Zend\\Loader\\StandardAutoloader::registerNamespace(), called in /home/jsuggs/bbm/lib/Zend/Application/Application.php on line 319 and defined in /home/jsuggs/bbm/lib/Zend/Loader/StandardAutoloader.php on line 155

The method for defining namespaces to be autoloaded will either have to be updated to either: 1) Manually specify the directory 2) Have the application "guess" based on assumptions that namespace will be in the library directory with the same name

$autoloader->registerNamespace($namespace, APPLICATION\_PATH . '../lib/' . $namespace);

I think I would personally prefer the explicit option, but that does make the process a little more cumbersome.

Note this is a ZF2 issue only. Got a pull request out there to possibly close this: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/144>
