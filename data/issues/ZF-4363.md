### Description

Each term within an index has a list of matched documents. This list may be large enough and it may take a long time to load it.

This list also has some additional subindex known as "skip data". This info allows to check directly if some document matches specified term.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene should generate this info while indexing and store within the index.

I believe this was implemented for 1.7. If not, please reopen, Alex.
