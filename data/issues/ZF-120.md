### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/137>

Most of the methods used in creating the front controller allow you to chain methods together like the following example:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()
        ->setRouter(new My_Controller_Router())
        ->setControllerDirectory(My_App::path('app') . '/controllers')
        ->registerPlugin(new My_Controller_Plugin_Credentials())
        ->dispatch();


...except that 'setRouter' does not return an instance of the Zend\_Controller\_Front, breaking the chain. Would suggest that line 134 of Zend\_Controller\_Front is changed from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $this->_router = $router;
    
    ...to...
    
                $this->_router = $router;
                return $this;

MVC implementation in incubator (current SVN and 0.2.0 release) resolves this issue. All setters return $this.
