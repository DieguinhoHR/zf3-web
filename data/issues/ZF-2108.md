### Description

Now , following pattern is used for UTF-8 since ZF-1483. '/[^\\p{L}' . $whiteSpace . ']/u';

In Polish it may be suitable, but in Japanese the pattern is uncomfortable.

I think it seems like some language should have own pettern. The ZF-1248 may be better idea, i think. But I will propose a solution as next best in following.

if (!self::$\_unicodeEnabled) {

 
    $pattern = '/[^a-zA-Z' . $whiteSpace . ']/';


} else {

 
    if (extension_loaded('mbstring')) \{
    
        /*for example, Japanese, Chinese, Korean.*/
    
        $pattern = '/[^[:alpha:]' . $whiteSpace . ']/u';
    
    } else {
    
        /*for example, Polish, Czech  */
    
        $pattern = '/[^\p{L}' . $whiteSpace . ']/u';
    
    }


}

I mistook in the discription. I correct in following. ^\\p{Ll}\\p{Lu} is more better.

I change the title from "Ll and Lu should be used in Zend\_Filter\_Alpha." to "Different pattern may be needed for some language in Zend\_Filter\_Alpha."

I make test pattern for Zend\_Filter\_AlphaTest.php . I hope this will be useful.

What is the status of this issue and what action do we want to take on it?

I offered a solution in the file attachments, but it does not be discussed or applied.

Did this make it in to 1.5.0?

 

 

Posted by old of Satoru Yoshida (yoshida@zend.co.jp) on 2008-03-21T20:29:04.000+0000

No , I thought it into 1.0.5 if 1.0.5 is scheduled. But I find now it into 1.5.0 . So, I change list box of Fix Version to 1.5.0.

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-04-02T09:03:03.000+0000

Yes, these changes made it into 1.5.0 with SVN r8732 (see Fisheye or All tab).
