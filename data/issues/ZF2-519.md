ZF2-519: Unable to use persistent HTTPS connections with \\Zend\\Http\\Client\\Adapter\\Socket

### Description

When I use the following setup, I expect, that after the connection is opened on the first request, it is reused for the next ones.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new \Zend\Http\Client('<a href="https://example.org/">https://example.org/</a>', array(
        'persistent' => true, 
        'ssltransport' => 'ssl'
    ));


Instead, the connection is closed and new one is opened. The problem is in the socket adapter's connect() method - the part that checks if the new connection's host corresponds to the host we're already connected to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    190:         if (($this->connected_to[0] != $host || $this->connected_to[1] != $port)) {
    191:             if (is_resource($this->socket)) {
    192:                 $this->close();
    193:             }
    194:         }


(see [http://apigen.juzna.cz/doc/zendframework/â€¦](http://apigen.juzna.cz/doc/zendframework/zf2/source-class-Zend.Http.Client.Adapter.Socket.html#190))

The stored value is "ssl://example.org" which compared to the $host value "example.org" is always false, so the current connection is then closed.
