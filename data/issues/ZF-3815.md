### Description

Zend framework docs says: [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.quickstart.html#zend.form.quickstart.create)] "You can set additional HTML attributes for the

<

form> tag by using the setAttrib() or setAttribs() methods. For instance, if you wish to set the id, set the "id" attribute: <?php $form->setAttrib('id', 'login'); ?>"

This code does work but generated form will be like this:

<

form id="" ...> because: Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Form::render() overwrites $attribs['id']: $attribs['id'] = $form->getId();

Then $form->getId() gets into play, which in this situation runs line: $id = $this->getFullyQualifiedName();

then $this->getFullyQualifiedName(); which does: return $this->getName()

and finally, $this->getName(): return $this->getAttrib('name');

So "login" value of "id" attribute is overwritten and ignored.

I fixed an issue with this earlier this week. Please verify the subversion revision that you used to reproduce the results so I can determine whether or not the issue still exists.

I have just tested this bug under snapshot ZendFramework-20080529-9566 and it seem to be fixed :-)
