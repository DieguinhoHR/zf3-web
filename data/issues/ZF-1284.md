Your point 9 was reproduceable due to CLDR update and fixed with SVN 4521.

But 10 and 11 are not reproduceable. Please give details on OS PHP Version BCMath installed Standard locale

for 12 please add a new issue related to Zend\_Mail

Ubuntu 6.06 PHP 5.2.1 No bcmath $ locale LANG=en\_US LC\_CTYPE="en\_US" LC\_NUMERIC="en\_US" LC\_TIME="en\_US" LC\_COLLATE="en\_US" LC\_MONETARY="en\_US" LC\_MESSAGES="en\_US" LC\_PAPER="en\_US" LC\_NAME="en\_US" LC\_ADDRESS="en\_US" LC\_TELEPHONE="en\_US" LC\_MEASUREMENT="en\_US" LC\_IDENTIFICATION="en\_US" LC\_ALL=

Actually I am not able to reproduce the point 11.

I have manually tested with linux (redhat community server) and got same outputs as expected by the unit test.

Can you please verify with the actual svn if the issue is still there... If its not working please give me the output of the following code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend_Locale.php';
    $result = Zend_Locale_Format::getDate('July 4, 2007', array('locale' => 'en_US', 'date_format' => null));
    print_r($result);


so I can see what your system is expecting as output.

Thanks

None of those issues is happening anymore (rev 4823). So I think, this issue can be closed (whatever the fix was).

Fixed somewhere between SVN 4519 and 4835. Thanks Sebastian for testing.
