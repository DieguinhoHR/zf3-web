ZF-9252: SqlSrv driver doesn't handle tablename.fieldname in order by clause when using limit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-24T06:01:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-02-24T08:14:02.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Consider:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $select = $table->_select();
                $select->limit('tablename.fieldname DESC');
                $result = $table->fetchRow($select);


Results in the logical SQL of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "table".* FROM "tablename" ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" DESC


The fetchRow() causes a limit to be added, so the SqlSrv driver creates this SQL:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM (SELECT TOP 1 * FROM (SELECT TOP 1 "pages".* FROM "tablename" ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" DESC) AS inner_tbl ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" ASC) AS outer_tbl ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" desc


which is invalid T-SQL code as tablename is not in scope. The correct SQL should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM (SELECT TOP 1 * FROM (SELECT TOP 1 "pages".* FROM "tablename" ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" DESC) AS inner_tbl ORDER BY "inner_tbl"."fieldname" ASC) AS outer_tbl ORDER BY "outer_tbl"."fieldname" desc


Also, for the case where no offset is required, it can be simplified to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT TOP 1 "table".* FROM "tablename" ORDER BY "tablename"."fieldname" DESC


where the 1 is the $count passed into limit()
