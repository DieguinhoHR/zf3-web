You can turn on short\_tags in your php.ini, apache configuration, or .htaccess file. In your php.ini, use the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    short_open_tag = On


Within your apache configuration or .htaccess, use the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    php_flag short_open_tag On


Regardless, you can also always use long tags: "<?php" and "<?php echo" will _always_ work, even in your phtml files.
