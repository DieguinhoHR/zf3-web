ZF-1896: App\_FeedEntryParent::getLink() should search 'rel' values using a map
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-08-30T14:56:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:25.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_App\_FeedEntryParent::getLink() allows users to specify a 'rel' value which is to be searched for and retrieved. Currently this is accomplished by iterating over every entry in $\_link and checking to see if there's a match, which is an O( n ) operation. Performance could be improved by treating $\_link as a map rather than as an array, reducing complexity to O( log( n ) ).

Since we don't usually store very many links this probably won't make a big difference and I haven't done a performance analysis, but it should be an easy fix.

This issue was misfiled as PRIMITUS-4 back in June, moving to ZF instead.
