### Description

Within the wikification the top and bottom links can only jump to the next and the previous chapter.

It would be better if the links could also jump to the next section.

Example: Chapter a Section 1 Section 1 Section 2 Section 2 Chapter b

Not you can only jump from a to b Better would be if you could jump : a1 -> 1 -> b. Jumps should always jump from one page to the next page of the documentation not the next chapter.

As soon as you click on a chapter, you are able to navigate within this chapter to it's child pages. This is standard behaviour.

Close issue?

I meant another thing...

Go to this page [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/DOCDEVDE/1.+Zend)

On the bottom and the upper page you have a link bar.

It shows home and a link to the next or the previos page.

BUT: On this page I shows that the next page is 10. Json... It should be 1.1 Zend loadFile()

All pages do only show the link to the next chapter or the next page in the same hierarchy. 1.1 -> 1.2 1 -> 2

But in my opinion it should link to the next page instead of the next of the same hirarchy.. 1 -> 1.1 -> 1.x -> 2 and not 1 -> 2

From the chapters-header page I will not get to the chapters-child page but only to the next chapter-header page.

So far i have not found a plugin for confluence that allows this.

not currently supported by any known Confluence plugin.
