ZF-1320: Rowset::current() should return null instead of an error

### Description

If you call current() on a Rowset with no rows, or if you call current() when the Rowset iteration key is beyond the count of the Rowset, it throws an error about undefined offset.

The reason is that it's referencing the protected $\_data array by the current $\_pointer offset, and this may not exist.

Please correct the current() method to return null when requested for an invalid row. This makes it similar to fetchRow() which returns null if no rows match the conditions.
