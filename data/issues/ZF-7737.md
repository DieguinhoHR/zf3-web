### Description

In Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract

public function quoteInto($text, $value, $type = null, $count = null) { if ($count === null) { return str\_replace('?', $this->quote($value, $type), $text); } else { while ($count > 0) { if (strpos($text, '?') != false) { $text = substr\_replace($text, $this->quote($value), strpos($text, '?'), 1); } --$count; } return $text; } }

In the line "if (strpos($text, '?') != false) {", it should be !== and not !=, since position returned can be 0. Else, $table->select()->where('? = id', 123); //sample taken from forum in which I first wrote about this which is valid, won't work.

Nothing fancy, but I think it could affect some people =)

Patch applied to trunk and 1.9 release branch. In the future, please create your patches from the root of your ZF installation to ensure we patch the correct files. (There are many "Abstract.php" and "TestCommon.php" files!)
