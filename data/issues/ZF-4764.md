### Description

Why did the Zend\_Server\_Abstract have to change? I know this is part of performance issue fixing, but this shouldn't change the backwards compability of the abstract class!

Rather create a new Abstract class that inherits from the old one.

additionally the change also removed that strange lower() static function in the abstract class which is not used by any Zend component anymore but nevertheless COULD be used by a 3rd party. It has to readded to the class until 2.0 for BC reasons!

I will re-instate the missing public methods to Zend\_Server\_Abstract. However, a couple of notes:

- Prior to the recent refactoring, the only class that extended it from within ZF was Zend\_Rest\_Server. All functionality present in it was specific to that implementation.
- The currently coded functionality actually _is_ shared now, between both the XmlRpc and Json server implementations. I plan to refactor Zend\_Rest\_Server to make use of it in the future
- All old methods and properties that have been removed will be marked as deprecated, and the methods will now trigger an error (E\_USER\_NOTICE) noting this.

Honestly, I've heard of _nobody_ building on Zend\_Server\_Abstract, and I suspect it's because it simply had no value previously.

BTW, the new implementation offers the ability to create Zend\_Server\_Definition objects -- which make it trivial to perform the actual implementation of servers, as well as to share server definitions between different protocols.

I havent heard of anyone building on Zend\_Server\_Abstract either.

Due to no obvious reason Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover extends Zend\_Server\_Abstract. I want to change that but will wait for the 2.0 release to make that BC change.

$magic\_methods protected member and lowerCase() static method re-added as of r12300, but marked as deprecated.
