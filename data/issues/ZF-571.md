### Description

RFC821 Section 3.1 and RFC2821 Section 3.3 define the format of the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO SMTP commands:

 
            MAIL <SP> FROM:<reverse-path> <CRLF>
            RCPT <SP> TO:<forward-path> <CRLF>


The current Framework places a space character between the "colon" and the "less-than" characters:

 
        $this->_send('MAIL FROM: <'.$from_email.'>');
        $this->_send('RCPT TO: <' .$to. '>');


SMTP library developers need to do things better and cleaner than the next guy. There are ISPs that are starting to block (quite a large amount) of spam based on these syntax checks.
