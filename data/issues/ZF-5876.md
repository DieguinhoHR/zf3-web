### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     public function setMethod($method = self::GET)
     {
    -    $regex = '/^<a href="">www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt</a>" rel="nofollow">^\x00-\x1f\x7f-\xff\(\)<>@,;:\\\\"\/\[\]\?={}\s]+$/';
    -    if (! preg_match($regex, $method)) {
    +    static $methods = array('CONNECT', 'DELETE', 'GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS', 'POST', 'PUT', 'TRACE'); 
    +    if (!in_array($method, $methods)) {
             /** @see Zend_Http_Client_Exception */
             require_once 'Zend/Http/Client/Exception.php';
             throw new Zend_Http_Client_Exception("'{$method}' is not a valid HTTP request method.");
         }
     
    -    if ($method == self::POST && $this->enctype === null)
    +    if ($method == self::POST && $this->enctype === null) {
             $this->setEncType(self::ENC_URLENCODED);
    -
    +    }
         $this->method = $method;
     
         return $this;


If this is not wanted, then at the minimum I'd make regex a static.

Also, is the client supposed to speak [WebDAV, or would that be subject of another component?

In that case, we'd also need:

- PROPFIND
- PROPPATCH
- MKCOL
- COPY
- MOVE

I'd need the latter for my CouchDB class as well, so I'd propose adding them to the static array.

Anyway, assign back to me if you have no issues with the commit.

set component

Since the HTTP RFC clearly allows _any_ method as long as it doesn't contain any disallowed characters, and is not limited to the default methods mentioned in the RFC or any extended methods (the WebDav methods are just one kind of extension), I am staying with the regex. After all this is an HTTP client, and should support any server extension as long as it is HTTP-compliant.

I did drop the $regex variable as it was not needed, and fixed the coding standard issue also fixed in your patch.

Thanks!

Won't really fix - but $regex dropping and coding standard issue fixed in CS-17011
