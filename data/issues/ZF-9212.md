Please give something which is reproducable. Just a "xxx needs" or "xxx should be" is not enough.

If you attach this Validator to Zend\_Form like:

(...) 'validators' => array (new Zend\_Validator\_Postcode('pl\_PL')), (...)

And write in form for example string "hello" it shows error like:

"'' is wrong formated postcode"

Message in Zend\_Validator\_Postcode is set to "'%value%' is wrong formated postcode"

And as you can see in this weak example that %value% is not set in isValid() method.

Sorry for this not formal code but I`m out of office now.
