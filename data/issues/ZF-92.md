### Description

Below is a diff between a modified version of Zend/Search/Lucene.php and the original from 0.1.3. The differences add a feature to Zend\_Search\_Lucene::find() to allow an offset from the start of the result set and a maximum returned result set size to be specified without breaking backward compatibility. I've found that it substantially reduces processing time in cases where only a portion of the result set is desired.

find() needs to retrive full result set to order it by score.

From the other side each $hits entry is only <docID, score> pair. All other document attributes are retrieved from index "by request". Thus it's not necessary to limit result set.

With best regards, Alexander Veremyev.

This improvement will not increase performance actually, but only will complicate API.
