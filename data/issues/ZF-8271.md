### Description

This constant is provide a value for PDO attribute: PDO::ATTR\_ORACLE\_NULLS (available with all drivers, not just Oracle): Conversion of NULL and empty strings.

This constant is passing to the driver, but will not working properly because PDO::NULL\_TO\_STRING has a different value. Maybe this PDO attribute has been changed between php versions.

As a simple workaround I am using PDO::NULL\_TO\_STRING instead of Zend\_Db::NULL\_TO\_STRING, but in my opinion it is a problem and potentially affect all of Zend's PDO equivalent constant. Maybe It would be nice found a general solutions to this kind if problem (keeping contants up to date and compatible).

Not sounds a serious problem but I spent 2 hour debugging to find a reason to some weird errors in my app. :)

Can you provide some code that demontstrates the issue? Perhaps a schema and a reproduction case would help understand the issue here.
