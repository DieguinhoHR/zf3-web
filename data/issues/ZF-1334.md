### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">$row = $this->_getTable()->fetchRow($where);
            
    if (null === $row) {
            require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Row/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception('Cannot refresh row as parent is missing');
    }
    
    $this->_data = $this->_getTable()->fetchRow($where)->toArray();

Here, you do two time the same database query

```

and I don't see the reason, you don't change anything between. In $row you have already the correct result.

There is the same issue in the \_\_construct method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    105: if ($table = $this->_getTable()) {
    106:         $info = $this->_getTable()->info();
    107:         $this->_primary = (array) $info['primary'];
    108: }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_getTable()


Here it isn't so important.
