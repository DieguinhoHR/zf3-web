### Description

I'm not certain I'm using it correctly, but it seems that subDate() is returning the wrong value.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $dayOne = new Zend_Date('12/22/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');
            $dayTwo = new Zend_Date('12/25/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');
    
            var_dump($dayOne->getIso()); //prints: string '2009-12-22T00:00:00-06:00' (length=25)
            var_dump($dayTwo->getIso()); //prints: string '2009-12-25T00:00:00-06:00' (length=25)
    
            $dateDiff = $dayTwo->subDate($dayOne);
            var_dump($dateDiff->getIso()); //prints: string '-1-12-06T00:00:00-0600' (length=22)
        var_dump($dateDiff->get(Zend_Date::DAY_OF_YEAR)); //prints: string '339' (length=3)

I don't know what you want to archive but running the first example you gave I see no failure:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dayOne = new Zend_Date('12/22/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');
    $dayTwo = new Zend_Date('12/25/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');


Now we have ONE = 22.Dec.2009 TWO = 25.Dec.2009

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump($dayOne->getIso()); //prints: string '2009-12-22T00:00:00-06:00' (length=25)
    var_dump($dayTwo->getIso()); //prints: string '2009-12-25T00:00:00-06:00' (length=25)


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateDiff = new Zend_Date($dayTwo->subDate($dayOne));


Now you substract ONE from TWO which means: DAY: 25 - 22 = 3 MONTH: 12 - 12 = 0 YEAR: 2009 - 2009 = 0

So the calculation would be 3.0.0 As there is no month 0 the month is corrected to 12 of previous year This means 3.Dec.-1. Because you also took timezone into account and because the months differ between their days (30 <> 31) we have the result you got.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump($dateDiff->getIso()); //prints: string '-1-12-05T18:00:00-0600' (length=21)


As described before

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump($dateDiff->get(Zend_Date::DAY_OF_YEAR)); //prints: 338


Well... the 5.Dec of the year -1 before christ is the day 338 of this year.

The question is:

"What do you want to do"

My goal was to get an accurate difference in days between two days. Calculating this manually with sub() (or by substracting timestamps) and dividing by 86400 will not take into account DST, for example.

But substracting a date from another date will not return the difference. This returns of course only another date.

Timestamps do take DST and timezone into account.

From the mailinglist/manual/API:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $one = new Zend_Date($date1);
    $two = new Zend_Date($date2);
    
    $one->subDate($two);
    $days = $one->getDayOfYear();


But works only when the dates do not differ more than one year.

Closing as non-issue. subDate works as expected.

Thomas, your code appears similar to mine (I took my code from a post you made to the mailing list about a year ago) and does not seem to work for 12/22/2009 and 12/25/2009 or a number of other dates less than one year.

If I set:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $one = new Zend_Date('12/22/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');
            $two = new Zend_Date('12/25/2009', 'MM/dd/yyyy');
            $two->subDate($one);
            $days = $two->getDayOfYear();


Which returns a value of 339 when I print $days->get(Zend\_Date::DAY\_OF\_YEAR);

Sample values of $days: 12/25/2009 - 12/24/2009 = 1969-12-03T18:00:00-06:00 (335) 12/25/2009 - 11/25/2009 = 1969-01-02T18:00:00-06:00 (0) 12/25/2009 - 10/25/2009 = 1969-02-01T18:00:00-06:00 (30) The values are off by a month.
