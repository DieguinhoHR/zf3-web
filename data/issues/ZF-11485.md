### Description

(Sorry for my english)

On Iphone and Ipad, are not displayed by the browser!

If I want to validate a form, with a not required file element within,

I expect a successful validation, although the file element value is empty But the validation failed with the message : "File 'myfile' exceeds the defined ini size".

If I validate this form with an Iphone/Ipad, in PHP, the global var $\_FILES will be an empty array, but the Zend\_Validate\_File\_Upload validator, used by Zend\_File\_Transfert\_Adapter\_Http, will detect this as a oversized file upload failure.

To reproduce this error on firefox, we can create a simple form

=== $form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->addElement('File', 'myfile'); $form->addElement('Submit', 'submit'); $form->setEnctype(Zend\_Form::ENCTYPE\_MULTIPART);

$form->setAction($targetUrl);
=============================

and use firebug to delete the element. And submit the form.

The target url must try to validate the form :

if($form->isValid($\_POST)) { echo 'ok'; // Processing and exit } var\_dump($form->getMessages());

One thing you can do in ZF >= 1.11 is use Zend\_Http\_UserAgent and check to see if the client supports xhtml\_file\_upload (which none of the iOS devices do, currently).

Check out the docs online for how to set it up: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.user-agent.html)

Actually there is no way for Zend\_File or Zend\_Form to recognise if the attached agent supports file uploads or not

I see no way how an solution to this problem could be done when an i\* agent behaves like an oversized upload

Feel free to reopen as soon as there is an solution on how this could be recognised

This issue is very bad...

Even the file element has setRequired(false), the form is not validated...
