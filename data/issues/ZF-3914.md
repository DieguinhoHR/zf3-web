### Description

with the current implementation of dojo helper one should call

$this->dojo()->requireModule("module1")->requireModule("module2")->requireModule("module3")->requireModule("module4");

It would be nice to have a multiple require command, something like:

$this->dojo()->requireModule(array('module1', 'module2' , 'module3', 'module4'));
