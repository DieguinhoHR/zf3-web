ZF-9267: 1.10.2 Command Line Tool Bug
-------------------------------------

### Description

I dropped in the new library. I was working with 1.9.4 and I dropped in 1.10.2. My application is working fine as far as I can tell but when I attempted to use the command line tool to create a new action for one of my controllers, I received the error below.

Command: zf create action myaction mycontroller

Error: Controller Mycontroller does not exist.

I reverted back to 1.9.4 and the command worked flawlessly (save for the annoying extra tabs it places in my code). Is it because 1.10.2 expects controllers to have the first letter be a capital letter? If so, why the change from the behavior from 1.9.4? And if so, does this mean that I now have to change all the names of my controllers?

Thanks,

~Matt

Does anyone have any idea why this may be happening?

Matt this isn't a bug I don't think. What is happening is that Zend\_Tool appends controller to the end of your controller name. The correct way to use the command would be

Action you want to create indexAction Controller to create the action in MyController

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    zf create action index my

Oh.. maybe I should be more clear.. I was attempting to create a new action on a controller I all ready had before I upgraded.

for instance:

zf create action view calendar

My choice of example was poor.
