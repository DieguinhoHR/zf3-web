### Description

The current \_\_construct method looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     public function __construct($server, $httpClient = null, $introspector = null)
     {
         if ($httpClient === null) {
             $this->_httpClient = new Zend_Http_Client();
         }
     
         if ($introspector === null) {
             $this->_introspector = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client_ServerIntrospection($this);
         }
       
         $this->_serverAddress = $server;
    }


It would make sense if when I pass Zend\_Http\_Client to the \_\_construct of Zend\_Xmlrpc\_Client, that the object is used. I know that there is a setHttpClient() method (aka the workaround), which is why I marked this as an improvement and not a bug.
