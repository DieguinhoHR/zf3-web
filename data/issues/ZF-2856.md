### Description

It would be nice if a UNION method was eventually added to Zend\_Db\_Select. If I get a bit (ha, that'll happen), I'll try to write a patch for it if nobody gets to it first.

Maybe a method of Zend\_Db\_Adapter?

$sql = $db->union(array($sel1, $sel2, $sel3));

I write $sql because it wouldn't be a Zend\_Db\_Select instance... i.e. I can't call a where() _after_ the union...

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Actually, I do think this belongs to the Zend\_Db\_Select as it is part of constructing a query and you can also manipulate the 'having', 'order' and 'limit' clauses.

I'm testing a prototype now and will release to the incubator when the unit tests have been written.
