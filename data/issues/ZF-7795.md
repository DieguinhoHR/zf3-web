### Description

There's no way to create the layouts-directory or a default layoutscript with Zend\_Tool. Because these have to be created manually, the project is not completely manageable with Zend\_Tool anymore.

Assigning to Ralph. Directory created should be application/layouts/views, with file layout.phtml.

Can be closed since enabling layout works already. Only the disable part does not work yet.

zf enable layout
