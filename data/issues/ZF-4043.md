### Description

There doesn't _appear_ to be definitive list of all the input validators available with Zend\_Form elements. The documentation should list all the validators, their parameters & a couple of brief examples of what they do/don't accept

There is documentation for these; you're just looking in the wrong place. \* [Validators](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.set.html) \* [Filters](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.set.html)
