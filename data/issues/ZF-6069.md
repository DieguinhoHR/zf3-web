ZF-6069: Wrong header encoding
------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-19T10:51:43.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-09-18T02:37:30.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Mail::\_encodeHeader() does not work correctly for some combinations of charset and string length.

As described in RFC 2047: <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2047.html> An 'encoded-word' may not be more than 75 characters long, including 'charset', 'encoding', 'encoded-text', and delimiters. If it is desirable to encode more text than will fit in an 'encoded-word' of 75 characters, multiple 'encoded-word's (separated by CRLF SPACE) may be used.

This CRLF SPACE was added only for the message itself, but not including meta prefix and postfix (charset, encoding) as it should. Try to send a mail using charset="utf-8" (1. constructor parameter for Zend\_Mail) and a subject like this:

Neue Nachricht im Stat@las: RE: RE: Nachrichten im Postausgang l√∂schen

You'll get

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    =?utf-8?Q?Neue=20Nachricht=20im=20Stat@las:=20RE=5F=20RE=5F=20Nachrichten=20im=20Postausgang=20l=C3=B6sche= n?=


As you can see, there's a whitespace at the end of this string. This is in fact a CRLF created by Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable($value) in \_encodeHeader() after exactly 76 chars:

Neue Nachricht im Stat@las: RE: RE: Nachrichten im Postausgang l=C3=B6sche= n

The following bugfix works, but I think it's not that beautiful:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _encodeHeader($value)
        {
            if (Zend_Mime::isPrintable($value)) {
                return $value;
            } else {
                $quotedValue  = Zend_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable($value, 9999); // do NOT add CRLF now
                $quotedValue  = str_replace(array('?', ' ', '_'), array('=3F', '=20', '=5F'), $quotedValue);
                $encodedValue = '=?' . $this->_charset . '?Q?' . $quotedValue . '?=';
                $encodedValue = wordwrap($encodedValue); // add CRLF now
                return $encodedValue;
            }
        }


(sorry, missing new lines here in code, no idea how to fix that)

wordwrap() is used instead of chunk\_split(), because it may destroy an entity occurence at position 76 of the string.

Which version was used to get this bug?

It seems it is not 1.8, which includes a bugfix for these problems. Can you verify this problem still occurs?

Veryfing the code in the bug comment I saw that this snippet is from a version < 1.8 of Zend Framework, however the Mail HEader encoding Bug was fixed with 1.8.2 or something, so please upgrade to that specific version and re-open the issue if this is still occurring.
