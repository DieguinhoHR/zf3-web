### Description

I am trying to send extra parameter to links of paging. I am using Zend Paginator. currently link is

/user/list/page/2

I want to send additional parameters as well

/user/list/address/a/page/2

Here is the detail of my code:

//In Controller: $page=$this->\_getParam('page',1); $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($rowSet); $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(50); $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);

$this->view->clientList = $paginator; $this->view->paginator=$paginator; //In View: <?php echo $this->paginationControl($this->paginator, 'Sliding', 'pagination\_control.phtml'); ?>

I want to pass the parameters from text field of search as extra parameters to my link.

Please help me on this problem. Thanks.
