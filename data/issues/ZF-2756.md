ZF-2756: setOptions in Zend\_Translate constructor
--------------------------------------------------

### Description

Please, let me know if I'm wrong but I think that "$options" passed to "Zend\_Translate" constructor are not automatically set to the adapter object. I mean, they're used to instanciate the adapter BUT its "\_options" property is not set with this value. So if I want to use some particular options in a new translate object (and its adapter) I must call both methods (constructor and setOptions) with the "$options" array. Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $options = array('separator' => '|');
    $this->_translate = new Zend_Translate($this->transl_adapter, $file, $language, $options);
    $this->_translate->setOptions($options);     // $options Â¿again?

You are wrong. :-)

Why should a factory class itself set a private property of another class ? Zend\_Translate creates a new adapter passing the options parameter to the constructor of the created class.

Well, maybe I didn't explain properly: it should be the "Zend\_Translate\_Adapter" constructor who saves the "$options" array it receives.

Look at the code I wrote: don't you think it's stupid to call "setOptions" if you just created the object with the same "$options"?

Well, maybe you wrote "Zend\_Translate" and also your example states "Zend\_Translate" ? ;-) ;-) Btw: Quite confusing, as noone knows what $this->transl\_adapter is...

I'll have a look at it

Behaviour changed with SVN-8452

Well, I was working with Zend\_Translate. You can understand the problem... if you want to.

Maybe $this->transl\_adapter is a property for the translate adapter I'd like to use. It doesn't matter which one.
