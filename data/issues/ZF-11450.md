ZF-11450: Extending Zend\_Log\_Writer and their factory-methods

### Description

If there is any need to extend a writer, for example Firebug to add functionality from FirePHP, you can set a writerNamespace property, e.g.

in an ini-property file:

firebug.writerNamespace = "My\_Log\_Writer" firebug.writerName = "Firebug"

The Zend\_Log::getClassName method works fine, it will recognize the namespace given in $config array, but then call\_user\_func calls the factory method from Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug and the code there:

public static function factory() { return new self(); }

returns a Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug instance instead of My\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug.

So the factory method must be overridden to take some effect.

solution for php5.3 compatibility is to use return new static, for php5.2 support there is no potential but override the factory method.
