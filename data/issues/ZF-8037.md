### Description

source: Zend/Translate/Adapter.php code: if (strpos($directory, DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR . $this->\_options['ignore']) !== false) { // ignore files matching first characters from option 'ignore' and all files below continue; }

bug on win platform, because project uses tmx scan and this folder: d:.work...\\languages

resolution: DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR to '/' or if ($this->\_options['ignore'] != '') {}

Any why should this code be unlogic ?

Simply look into the manual to know how this option works. Just because you don't read, it does not mean that it does not work as expected.

Manual: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.additional.html) {quote} All directories and files beginning with this prefix will be ignored when searching for files. This value defaults to '.' which leads to the behavior that all hidden files will be ignored. Setting this value to 'tmp' would mean that directories and files like 'tmpImages' and 'tmpFiles' would be ignored as well as all subsequent directories {quote}
