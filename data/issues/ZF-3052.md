### Description

viewScript and helper are set as attributes to elements when source is rendered... I see sample solution -> Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Image::$\_attribBlacklist  
 But only there it is implemented. Should be done for all Elements.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $el = new Zend_Form_Element_Select('el_name');
            $el->viewScript = 'index/ba.html';
            $el->setDecorators(array(
                                    array('ViewScript', array('class' => 'form element')),
                                    //array('ViewHelper', array('helper' => 'formSelect'))
                                    ));
    
            $form->addElement($el);


output:

While I can see this as nice when validating against w3c, there are applications where having arbitrary attributes can be useful -- dojo and other JS toolkits utilize custom attributes to configure elements.

Any solution such as this (whitelisting or blacklisting) should be configurable -- i.e., it can be either on or off by default, with methods or configuration options to toggle the behavior.

Tentatively scheduling for next minor release. Will require significant amount of work to make form decorators/view helpers comply with w3c specifications, and the benefit, while nice, is one that is negligible.

Well then, perhaps postpone this for later. Maybe not worth so much work if little benefit - never thought of applications needing arbitrary attributes. I just thought of this as bug and from my point of view wasn't so much work. Of course you have much better overview in Zend\_Form and the like. I see no votes here so I guess best option is don't touch at all for now.

Too many moving parts. Some parts can be fixed on a case-by-case basis, but a sweeping change to blacklisting would break too many other areas at this time.
