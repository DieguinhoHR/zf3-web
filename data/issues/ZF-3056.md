ZF-3056: Using() methods will only prepend joining table to columns
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When joining multiple tables, it becomes impossible to use Using() methods. This is due in part to Using() actually just being converted to an ON clause.

Example:

$select = $this->select()->setIntegrityCheck(false) ->from('users') ->joinUsing('user\_bugs', 'user\_id') ->joinUsing('bugs','bug\_id');

echo $select->\_\_toString();

this outputs something like:

SELECT \* FROM users JOIN user\_bugs ON users.user\_id = user\_bugs.user\_id JOIN bugs ON users.bug\_id = bugs.bug\_id

The problem is, users.bug\_id does not exist. It will do this for any join, and forces you to use the join() method rather than Using() because it will only prepend the first table to the field name.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

The use case you're describing is not intended for joinUsing - the column must exist in both the primary table and target table for this method to be applicable. Otherwise, you can simply revert to the JoinXXX methods.
