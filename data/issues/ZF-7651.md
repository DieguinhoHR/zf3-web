ZF-7651: Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db - ability to get DB connection object as parameter

### Description

Currently we can pass to the Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db only array with connection options. I have tried to use SQLite to store queue's messages, could not do it, bacause I could not set _host \_, \_username_ and _password_ options (these options do not necessary for SQLite).

It will be easier to work with Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db if we can pass $db object directly instean of options array.

Here is sample code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($options['type'], $options);
    
    $queue = new Zend_Queue('Db', $db);

Justin,

If a 'db' key/value is passed via driverOptions, then that will be used instead of attempting to connect to a database.

Is this good with you?

Could you please write up some test code to test this functionality? You may want to use a SQLLite database.
