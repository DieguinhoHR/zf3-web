Partial fix for non-5.3 issues. Only was running the MySqli and sqlite tests.

Also include adjustments to the tests because many of the tests were being skipped with 'too many connections', so added in the tearDown closing the DB connection.

Had an issue with: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Pdo\_MysqlTest::testTableFetchallCanHandleWhereWithParameritizationCharacters Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: no parameters were bound but it went away when I started looking for it.

This patch still leaves the error: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_SqliteTest::testAdapterAlternateStatement Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 no such table: zfbugs

tested on Debian Lenny

View\_Helper\_Currency tests should now pass on trunk and branch.

I am actually not able to reproduce the other issues on Zend\_Date/Zend\_Validate. And I am missing some informations to reproduce. Your file for Windows-Tests is also stripped.

Note: Is it possible to output the SVN release where unittests have been made from? Because there is no note and some of the mentioned classes like Zend\_Validate\_Barcode have been undertaken several changes in the last days.

I will attach my todays result for AllTests on Windows (5.2.11) with default installation and default config file in a few minutes
