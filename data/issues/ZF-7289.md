### Description

I came across valid usecases some time ago which gave me 2 rows in a table with both the same username. Zend\_Auth didn't like this, and gave me some ambiguity error. Imho Zend\_Auth makes an assumption here that should be left up to the developer. Therefore I propose to add a flag by which the developer(s) can either disable or enable this check.

Can you supply some kind of script or api that demonstrates the issue?

Create a sample database. Insert two user accounts with the same username, but different passwords. Attempt to log in as one of them. Await Error: "More than one record matches the supplied identity."

Users of our system do not interact with each other, there's no reason to force username uniqueness. Yes, we are catching duplicate passwords :).

In my opinion this isn't something what Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable should implement.

One question: What message do you show if on user would like to change it's password to the same as one of the other users with the same name? -> Sorry, your given password is already defined by an other user. !??!?!?!?!?

I think you have do write our own adapter (out of zf) if this functionality is a must have for you.

that's not the point, the point is that zend\_auth shouldn't contrain me, at least not unoptionally (as of now, that is English).

implemented this issue into the Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable.

usage:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $authAdapter->setAmbiguityIdentity(true);


can also be used fluently.

I think that is best apply in Minor release. Too can be mentioned this feature in the manual.

Greetings, Ramon
