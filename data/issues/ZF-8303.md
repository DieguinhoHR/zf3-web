### Description

Hi,

That's just a naming convention, but id's generated by fieldset decorator are looking like that:

fieldset-name. So the element name is appended

Instead of this the rest of decorators are actually prepending the name of the element:

name-element name-label aso.

That's just a small naming convention mistake, but should be fixed anyway...

Patch and unit test added.

This will break any CSS that currently selects on fieldset-name.

Add migration notes for 1.12 or we accept the current behaviour and close this ticket?!

I would say to add it on 1.12 series.
