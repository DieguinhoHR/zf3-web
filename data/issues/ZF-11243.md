### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract toArray method isn't always called when calling toArray on the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract. Currently there's a TODO in the code that states this issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">`
    
    When calling toArray on the rowset, shouldn't we be instantiating the row class and calling the toArray method on it?
    
    Here's an updated version of the method up for discussion:
    


/\*\* \* Returns all data as an array. \* \* Updates the $\_data property with current row object values. \* \* @return array \*/ public function toArray() { if (!$this->\_rows && $this->\_data) { foreach ($this->\_data as $i => $data) { $this->\_loadAndReturnRow($i); } }

 
    // @todo This works only if we have iterated through
    // the result set once to instantiate the rows.
    foreach ($this->_rows as $i => $row) {
        $this->_data[$i] = $row->toArray();
    }
    return $this->_data;


} ```

Thoughts?

By iterating and loading rows, there is a chance memory might increase. I wonder if this should be optional behavior?

Is there something you're missing by not instantiating a row object?

I needed the rows to be initialized because when I call toArray on the rowset, I want it to call toArray on each row as well. In my implementation, I had the toArray for each row producing a custom array representation of the row.

Thoughts?

TMHO the proposition is wrong, it'll fail if some rows but not all have already been loaded with \_loadAndReturnRow, \_rows would be set but incomplete, here's an improved version.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function toArray()
    {
        foreach ($this->_data as $i => $data) {
            $row = $this->_loadAndReturnRow($i);
            $this->_data[$i] = $row->toArray();
        }
        return $this->_data;
    }


I agree that the current behavior is unexpected, the user of the class shouldn't care wether or not rows have been accessed.

I suggest to simply iterate over rows registered in the \_data array, at first glance this has no overhead.
