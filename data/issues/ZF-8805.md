### Description

The documentation implies that the following is possible:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filter = new Zend_Filter_Encrypt(array(
        'adapter' => 'openssl',
        'private' => '/path/to/mykey/private.pem'
    ));


The problem is that all arguments handed to the adapter, will be used as public key.
