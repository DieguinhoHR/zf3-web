### Description

It would be nice if Zend\_Config\_Writer would skip section names if instructed to do so.

I am using Zend\_Config\_Ini for my testing, development and staging environments but I create a single Zend\_Config (array) for use in my production environment.

The change is really simple, write() should have an extra parameter:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    public function write($filename = null, Zend_Config $config = null, $exclusiveLock = null, $useSectionName = true)


and instead of just checking if section name is a string

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
            if (is_string($sectionName)) {
                $data = array($sectionName => $data);
            }


we could check for the $useSectionNames as well:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
            if (($useSectionName) && (is_string($sectionName))) {
                $data = array($sectionName => $data);
            }


If it will help I can provide patch files for these changes.

Hi, can I expect this issue to be resolved. What can I need do to make this happen?

Is it necessary to explain the use case, submit patches, create tests?

Regards!

I will add a new ini writer for exactly this issue.

Added and documented a new config writer "SimpleIni" which writes all data into the global INI namespace.
