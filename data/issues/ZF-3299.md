### Description

If the OpenID Consumer is integrated in an environment with its own Session handling a Zend\_Session\_Exception is thrown (Consumer.php Line 756). I have this Problem with the Integration in the Symfony Framework. In 1.5.1 everything seems to work, the Subversion version fails.

The change which causes the Problem seems to be here:

[http://zendframework.com/fisheye/browse/…](http://www.zendframework.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/OpenId/Consumer.php?r1=8064&r2=9194)

Maybe an abstraction layer to access the session should be introduced, so that the OpenId Consumer does not depend on the Zend Session handling.
