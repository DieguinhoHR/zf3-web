### Description

If destination directory is not set, Zend\_File should assume that the destination directory is the same one that is returned by PHP function sys\_get\_temp\_dir().

This way is you use Rename Filter for moving the file to the final location after the upload you do not need to call setDestionation() on the element.

In case you are rendering a form with a file element that doesn't have destination set throws: "Warning: Exception caught by form: "file\_element\_name" not found by file transfer adapter"

This is exactly what this component already does.

You are right. I had the ViewHelper decorator turned on. After I've removed it, the error was gone.
