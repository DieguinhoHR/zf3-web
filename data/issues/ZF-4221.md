### Description

Cannot instantiate Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha without assigning CAPTCHA adapter first. Somthing like this will not work because the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha calls the validator on it's constructor $cAdapter = new Zend\_Captcha\_Image(); $cAdapter->setFont(path...); $element = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha('Captcha'); $element->setCaptcha($cAdapter)

- - - - - -

public function \_\_construct($spec, $options = null) { parent::\_\_construct($spec, $options); $this->setAllowEmpty(true) ->setRequired(true) ->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator(false) ->addValidator($this->getCaptcha(), true); // FAILS..... }

You can pass a captcha in to the constructor, or via configuration details (using the short name of the captcha adapter and any options necessary to instantiate it).

The rationale is that the captcha adapter is necessary for both validation and rendering purposes. Moving the adapter verification outside the constructor makes the object less stable and requires much more complexity to ensure those locations where it is needed it is present.

While it would be possible to support this, it would be considered a BC break at this time. If you feel strongly about the issue, please re-open the issue and lay out a _strong_ rationale for introducing the break.
