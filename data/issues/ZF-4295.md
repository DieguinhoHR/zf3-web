ZF-4295: Zend\_Pdf\_Page::drawText() with UTF-8 strips multibyte characters
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

drawText() draws text without multibyte UTF-8 characters (lithuanian letters in particular). E. g. aąbcčd becomes abcd with ą and č skipped. (I hope this board supports those characters). Source text is encoded in UTF-8.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    drawText($myUtf8Text, $x, $y, 'UTF-8');

It strips them because of //IGNORE is passed into converting charset.

Problem is also that iconv throws notices whent converting from UTF-8 to CP1252

iconv() [function.iconv]: Detected an illegal character in input string in /Zend\_1.7.0/Zend/Pdf/Resource/Font/Simple.php on line 265

Standard PDF fonts support only Latin1 encoding (actually some superset of Latin1 encoding). To use non-Latin1 characters you have to use them with TTF fonts.

See [Using fonts](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.pdf.drawing.html#zend.pdf.drawing.using-fonts) and [Standard PDF fonts limitations](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.pdf.drawing.html#zend.pdf.drawing.standard-fonts-limitations) documentation sections for details.
