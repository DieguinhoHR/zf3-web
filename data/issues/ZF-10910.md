### Description

The code documentation for Zend\_Tool classes is quite poor at present.

- There are a lot of incorrect class descriptions that have been copy-pasted; for example virtually all the items under Zend/Tool/Project/Context/
- Many classes don't have a description at all, or much in the way of other comments for that matter.

Zend\_Tool isn't the only package with this problem of course, but it's especially noticeable because it's quite complex and its manual isn't very good either.

It would be great if someone who understands how the Zend\_Tool package works could go through and write useful class descriptions at least. This would help and encourage other developers to extend or solve problems with Zend\_Tool.
