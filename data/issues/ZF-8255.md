### Description

Almost all view helpers like "headScript" do not affect the original content when include via the view helper "action" due the cloning of the view instance in the action helper. It sounds all right to clone a view in order to not affect already assigned view variables but helpers like headScript, headMeta, ... should use the orginal view instance to perform alterations on the layout/view.
