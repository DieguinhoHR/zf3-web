I've run the tests both under PHP 5.2.10 and PHP 5.3.0, and cannot confirm the test failures; all tests pass for me.

What OS are you running, and what versions of PHP and PHPUnit? And can you try testing against current trunk? Many fixes to the testbed have been made since the beta was packaged.

I'm running Windows XP with PHP 5.3.0 an PHPUnit 3.4.0beta5. I haven't tried the current trunk but I will now do so.

I just checked current trunk, but output still is the same:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    1) Zend_Amf_AuthTest::testNoAcl
    Failed asserting that  contains "not allowed".
    
    2) Zend_Amf_AuthTest::testClassAclDenied
    Failed asserting that  contains "not allowed".
