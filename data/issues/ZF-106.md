### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/112>

In playing around with the Lucene\_Search tool, I ran into a PHP Fatal error when trying to load large amounts of data (actually, not all that much data, but around 200,000 varchar(100) text fields): PHP FATAL ERROR: Allowed memory size of 104857600 bytes exhausted (tried to allocated 119 bytes) in Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common/Text.php on line 65. and PHP FATAL ERROR: Allowed memory size of 104857600 bytes exhausted (tried to allocated 64 bytes) in Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentWriter.php on line 480.

I am curios if there are any known restrictions on the amount of data you can use when building the Lucene search documents?

Actually, this is just a limitation on the memory of my box for building a large index. So, it looks like I will have to create multiple segments to achive my needs. On the Lucene site, it indicates there should be an ImageWriter->optimize() function to help optimze indexes, yet if I call this on the Zend\_Search\_Lucene object, it appears as if this is not a valid method. Is this scheduled to be ported over?

another one of the memory related issues, assign to the version where you think these will be fixed. I put it in 0.3.0 as a placeholder.

This was the same ticket from [ZF-88](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-88) that was ported over by the Alexander Veremyev, aparently this was ported over after that, closing duplicate.
