### Description

Actualy it's not possible to validate an url contains an ipv6 host with Zend\_Uri, like <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt>

This affect many others componements, like Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter, that could run fine if validation passed.

Code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Uri.php';
    
    var_dump(Zend_Uri::check('<a href="http://[::1]/foo.html">http://[::1]/foo.html</a>', 'Uri'));

I would propose to use Zend\_Validate\_Hostname for the hostname part, I think running the zend\_validate\_hostname unittests on zend\_uri\_http would reveal more flaws.

Zend\_Validate\_Hostname does not detect IPv6 addresses with hex decimal f in them before r23900

Reproducing test case plus fix. Applying patch had no visible consequence w.r.t execution of test suite.

NOTE: Your ZF repo must be at r23900 or higher due to dependence on fix for ZF-11334
