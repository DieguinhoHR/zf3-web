### Description

error in browser: Fatal error: Class Zend\_Json\_Server contains 1 abstract method and must therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods (Zend\_Server\_Interface::getFunctions) in /myserver/library/Zend/Json/Server.php on line 32

Code to reproduce error: $json = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"api.sessionStart","params":["1","127.0.0.1","xyz","foo"],"id":"foo"}';

$client = new Zend\_Http\_Client("http://dev.kargo.com/json");

$client->setRawData($json); $response = $client->request("POST"); print $response->getBody(); print $client->getLastRequest();
