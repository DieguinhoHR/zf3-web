### Description

Google API expect specific method for each action. To create a new entry in blogger you have to use POST (HTTP), but if you want to modify this entry, you have to use PUT.

GData only allow post so you can't modify an entry for example in Blogger. This also affect the new Picasa API as you have to use PUT to update a photo.

This should affect other Google API.

The DELETE (HTTP) should also be allowed.

Proposal: Maybe the HTTP method should be an attribute of the method post of the class Zend\_Gdata (and maybe the method post should be renamed)

The GData component does allow for modifying an entry via retrieving an individual entry, updating it, and then calling the save() method on it. The same thing is true of the delete() method. (These two are located in Zend\_Feed\_EntryAtom).

It may be desirable to have a method put() and delete() in the Zend\_Gdata class which takes an entry and calls the put or delete method on it-- but this would only be for convenience and uniformity, and would not add functionality. As the delete method would not require anything beyond the edit URL for an entry, it could acceept either just the edit URL or an EntryAtom as params.

Zend\_Gdata has always supported updates to entries. Updating the entry object and performing $entry->save() updates the entry on the server by performing a HTTP PUT operation. $entry->delete deletes the entry from the server by performing a HTTP DELETE operation.

As of ZF 1.0PR1, Zend\_Gdata\_App (which each service inherits from) also supports performing the updates/deletes by passing an entry and/or URL.
