ZF-10436: Zend\_View\_Abstract private variables
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-09-08T14:13:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-09-09T06:37:12.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_View\_Abstract uses a number of private variables. It provides accessors for some (but not ALL) of those.

The private variables prohibit derived classes from manipulating those variables which would be fine if accessors allowed them to be changed.

Extending Zend\_View and Zend\_View\_Abstract is therefor effectively prevented in cases where one may want to do some advanced behaviour modification.

Changing the protection for the private variables will allow those classes to be extended while still preserving the protection against public access offered by the \_\_set/assign methods ...

This is a design decision that is clearly spelled out on the "Zend\_View\_Abstract" page ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.abstract.html)).

Zend Framework 2.0 will rectify this situation, but do not expect any changes before then.

Thank you for taking the time to respond but I disagree. I understand the whole rationale explained on the link you provided BUT it is perfectly possible to maintain the goals and protections set out in the manual AND allow derived classes to extend the base. This is a key OO concept ... Nonetheless ... For now I will just duplicate the class hierarchy then ...

I understand that you disagree. I also pointed out that we plan to rectify the situation for ZF2. We simply cannot at this time due as it would introduce BC breaks.
