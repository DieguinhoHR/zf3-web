ZF-795: Zend\_Measure failed type extraction
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-24T14:53:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.8.0 (21/Feb/07)

### Description

In Zend\_Measure the following code which begins on line 130 does not work as intended:

if (strpos($type, '::') !== false) { $type = substr($type, 0, strpos($type, '::')); $sublib = substr($type, strpos($type, '::') + 2); }

If your type is something like 'BINARY::KILOBYTE' for example, the expected output would be: $type = 'BINARY' $sublib = 'KILOBYTE'

However, the current code gives you $type = 'BINARY' $sublib = 'NARY'

because '::KILOBYTE' is removed from $type when it is assigned to the output from the initial substr() function call.

See official feedback on the proposal:

We are all voting to drop the Zend\_Measure class.

{quote}So from users eyes the changes are like this:

OLD: $unit = new Zend\_Measure($input,Zend\_Measure::TEMPERATURE); $unit->setType(Zend\_Measure\_Temperature::KELVIN);

NEW: $unit = new Zend\_Measure\_Temperature($input, Zend\_Measure\_Temperature::KELVIN); or $unit = new Zend\_Measure\_Temperature($input, 'kelvin'); {quote}

Fixed with SVN 3010 (Available in the I18N Branch)
