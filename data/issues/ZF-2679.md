### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Locale.php';
    
    $tmp = new Zend_Date(new Zend_Locale('en_US'));
    ?>

This script throws a Zend\_Locale\_Exception with message 'Autodetection of Locale has been failed!'

0 /libs/Zend/Locale.php(906): Zend\_Locale->\_\_construct()
===========================================================

1 /libs/Zend/Date.php(4444): Zend\_Locale::isLocale(NULL, true)
===============================================================

2 /libs/Zend/Date.php(172): Zend\_Date->setLocale(NULL)
=======================================================

3 /libs/Zend/Date.php(3261): Zend\_Date->\_\_construct(1203370195, 'TIMESTAMP', NULL)
=====================================================================================

4 /libs/Zend/Date.php(184): Zend\_Date::now()
=============================================

5 /www/date.php(5): Zend\_Date->\_\_construct(Object(Zend\_Locale))
===================================================================

line 184 of Zend/Date.php is $date = Zend\_Date::now(); and I think should be $date = Zend\_Date::now($locale);

this is a duplicate of <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2404>

This problem has already been reported several times.

The described workaround is eighter to set a locale with setlocale() if your environment does not provide one (which is the reason of Autodetection failed), or to fetch the exception which is also a standard behaviour on exceptions.

You could also use the trunk, 1.5RC or wait the 4 days until 1.0.4 is out. This problem has been solved about 4 months ago within the trunk.

And no, this is no duplicate of 2404.
