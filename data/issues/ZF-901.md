ZF-901: Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket::request causes infinite loop with HEAD request

### Description

This bug occurs when the Zend\_Http\_Client class is used to issue a HEAD request using the default Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket adapter class. The following conditions in the response headers must exist for the bug to have an effect.

- Connection header is present, but does not have a Close value (e.g. Keep-Alive).
- Transfer-Encoding header is not present.
- Content-Length header is present.

The bug's effect is that the adapter class falls back to a case where it expects to read in the Content-Length header's associated value worth of bytes. Since a server does not deliver a body for HEAD requests (being that is one of the defining characteristics of a HEAD request), the adapter class gets stuck in an infinite loop. Below is a code example utilizing a URL which exposes the bug.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require 'Zend/Http/Client.php';
    $http = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $http->setUri('<a href="http://www.technicat.com/writing/programming.html">http://www.technicat.com/writing/programming.html</a>');
    $response = $http->request('HEAD');

Thanks!

This should be fixed in HEAD. Please let me know if you still encounter issues.
