### Description

If is

$view->getScriptPath($param) leads on directory. Method returns path to directory. ANd directory is not script and it could be easily improved.

In protected function \_script($name) { ... foreach ($this->\_path['script'] as $dir) { if (is\_readable($dir . $name) && !is\_dir($dir . $name)) { return $dir . $name; } } ...

will resolve the problem.
