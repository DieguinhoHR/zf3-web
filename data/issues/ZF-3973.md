Zend\_Controller\_PHPDoc.patch is applied at SVN r11013, I think. Zend\_Dom\_PHPDoc.patch is applied at SVN r11013, I think. Zend\_Json\_PHPDoc.patch is applied at SVN r11177. I do. Zend\_Measure\_PHPDoc.patch is applied at SVN r11013, I think. Zend\_Wildfire\_PHPDoc.patch is applied at SVN r11176. I do.

This issue is all solved.
