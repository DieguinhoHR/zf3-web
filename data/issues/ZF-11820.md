ZF-11820: User parameters get lost by assembling routes other than the current route

### Description

There are several routes with wildcards defined in an zf application, e. g.

route A: @prepend/:action/\* (Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route) route B: @prepend/:id/:@action/\* (Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route)

If route A has matched for an request and route B should be assembled without resetting the user parameters, the assembled route B does not include the parameters from the current request. It seems only route A has collected the parameters during the matching proccess and so the wildcard from route B could not be filled with these parameters.
