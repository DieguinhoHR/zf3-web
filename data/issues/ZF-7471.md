### Description

When defining field rules for Zend\_Filter\_Input, default value cannot be array.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        $data = array(); // post no data
        $fields = array(
                'names' => array(
                    Zend_Filter_Input::DEFAULT_VALUE => array(1, 2, 3),
                )
            );
            $filters = array();
    
            $zfi = new Zend_Filter_Input($filters, $fields, $data);
            var_dump($zfi->getUnescaped()); // array(1) { ["names"]=>  int(1) }
            // names should be array(1, 2, 3)


In Zend/Filter/Input.php there is still /\*\* @todo according to this code default value can't be an array. It has to be reviewed \*/. Maybe it's time to get this fixed.
