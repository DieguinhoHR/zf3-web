ZF-6779: Sidebar overlays large tables
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Improvement Created: 2009-05-22T04:33:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:06.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

On pages such as [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.core-functionality.html) where large tables are used the sidebar (containing the index of ZF class names) overlays the table, making parts of the table unreadable.

This is happening on Safari 3 for Mac, Firefox 3 for Mac, and IE7 Windows. I am sure most browsers are affected.

I'd upload a screenshot if I could work out how to ;-)

This illustrates the overlay issue

One quick solution could be to write a 3rd party transformation script (hosted by anyone anywhere):

example.com/ZFTableToList

 <? function get\_page\_and\_convert\_any\_HTML\_tables\_into\_list($URL\_To\_ZF\_docs\_page\_to\_transform) { //pull page source //for each tbl found in source //convert each row into a list item //for each cell data prepend column header name return $string; } $output\_html = get\_page\_and\_convert\_any\_HTML\_tables\_into\_list($URL\_To\_ZF\_docs\_page\_to\_transform) echo $output\_html; ?> -- Then we can all just visit :

example.com/ZFTableToList?URL\_To\_ZF\_docs\_page\_to\_transform=[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.core-functionality.html)

to be able to see the table's data.

any keen community memeber can do this, i guess. (I would have done if i had the time)

not sure about copyright though. ;o)

ok...further to the last comment.

Done.

If you are having trouble reading the tbl use the html\_table\_to\_html\_list\_converter service to make it more readable: [http://industrystandardsoftware.com/online\_tools/…](http://industrystandardsoftware.com/online_tools/converters/html_table_to_html_list_converter.htm)
