### Description

I have used a Date validator in my form, which asks a time in format "HH:mm". If 'foo' is given, I will see an error message "'foo' is not valid" as expected. BUT I will also get an error ... _Zend\_Locale\_Exception: No date part in 'foo' found._

Sorry, not an issue... disabling the XDebug solved the problem.
