### Description

If there are more than one functions with same name but with different parameters, then all such functions listed in $client->getFunctions() have incorrect parameters.

For example [http://abslive3.timesgroup.com/clsReturnDataSet.soâ€¦](http://abslive3.timesgroup.com:8888/clsReturnDataSet.soap?wsdl) has two functions :

ReturnDataset(string $sql, string $TableName) and ReturnDataset(string $tName)

but both of these are listed as ReturnDataset(string $sql, string $TableName) and ReturnDataset(string $sql, string $TableName).

Besides this, call to $client->ReturnDataset(string $tName) seems to fail.

I don't think this is an ZF issue because we are using [SoapClient::\_\_getFunctions()](http://de2.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.getfunctions.php) to get this list of functions.

If this is a valid WSDL file - it's a PHP bug.
