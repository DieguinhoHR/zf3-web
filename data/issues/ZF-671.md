ZF-671: No baseUrl/pathInfo auto-detection in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2006-12-20T02:06:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

The default values that are returned when calling getPathInfo(), getBaseUrl(), etc. from Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http are empty strings rather than being auto-detected based on the actual request. This causes Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter->route() to try to match based on an incorrect value for $pathInfo. The attached patch fixes this.

Actually, the attached patch makes most tests fail, which means the fix is much more involved. I'll update once I get closer to a solution.

Thanks for fixing this. I have reviewed r2552 and while this seems to mostly fix this problem, it does seem to introduce a new problem in setBaseUrl(): it always sets $\_baseUrl to an empty string.

I have attached a patch that fixes this. I hope my understanding of what the existing code is supposed to do is correct. I have not run any of the tests with this patch yet so I'm not sure if it'd break anything. Note that I removed the strlen() and (false !== $pos) comparisons since the (0 === $pos) check makes them redundant.

What behaviour breaks by having $\_baseUrl be an empty string? I'm not sure that the fix you propose is needed, because I don't know what problem it fixes... (This isn't to bash you -- I just need more information)

If getBaseUrl() returns an empty string then getPathInfo() returns will contain the complete request URI. This means that, for instance, if you have a URI of /dir/action and mod\_rewrite passes this on to /dir/index.php, then getBaseUrl() returns "" and consequently getPathInfo() returns "/dir/action" instead of "/action". This does not seem right to me, and it causes Zend\_Controller routes to break unless I manually override $\_baseUrl.

What I'm seeing here is that your baseUrl should be set to '/dir'. What OS and web server are you running? It looks like Apache, so this should be autodetected. I'm going to write a few more tests to see if I can reproduce it or not.

I'm running Apache 2.0.52 with PHP 5.2.0 on Debian Linux 3.1.

Okay, I can reproduce this with the following test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testBasePathAutoDiscoveryWithPhpFile()
        {
            $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']     = '/dir/action';
            $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']        = '/dir/index.php';
            $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] = '/var/web/dir/index.php';
            $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
    
            $this->assertEquals('/dir', $request->getBasePath(), $request->getBaseUrl());
        }


I'll be attempting to fix this. In the meantime, you can always use setBaseUrl() manually to set the base URL properly.

Resolved in revision 2616. There were some subtle errors in the autodiscovery logic. Fixed this, and added an additional test for URLs of the form /dir/controller that resolve to /dir/index.php.

I've verified the fix in version 0.7.0 and it works fine now. Thanks a lot for getting this resolved!
