ZF2-264: ClassmapAutoloader returns void what cause problems with Doctrine ORM 2.2

### Description

The "autoload" function on Zend\\Loader\\ClassMapAutoloader always returns void, as opposed to the other autoloader implementations that return false or the return value of "include". I don't know if this is intentional, but it seems somewhat inconsistent and cause some issues with Doctrine ORM 2.2. In some cases Doctrine iterates over all registered spl autoloaders, checking for returns values to see if the autoloading was successfull. In this case it assumes that autoloading with the ClassMapAutoloader was unsuccessful because no value is returned and moves on to the standard autoloader. This causes a "Cannot redeclare class" fatal error if the loaded class has a classmap entry. If "autoload" returns a value the issue disappears.

Autoloader implementations are not supposed to return a value. The spl\_autoload stack actually does a class\_exists() check after each autoloader is run to see if the class is now in scope; if not, it moves on to the next autoloader until it runs out of autoloaders; the return value of the autoloader is irrelevant and ignored. As such, this is an issue in the Doctrine project, and not ZF.

The solution for Doctrine would be for it to loop over each callback, and run a "class\_exists($classname, false)" afterwards to test if the class now exists.

Ok, thanks for the fast answer. I'll post this issue to the Doctrine project.
