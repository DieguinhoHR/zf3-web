ZF-2457: Incorrect xml tag for database name in Zend\_Config\_Xml documentation

### Description

In the ZF Documentation for [Zend\_Config\_Xml](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.adapters.xml.html), the xml tag __ is used for the database name of the database you want to connect to. However, when using the example configuration file and passing the necessary configuration information to Zend\_Db::factory() using the toArray() method in the second parameter, it throws an error stating:

bq. "Configuration array must have a key for 'dbname' that names the database instance".

Changing the xml tag to __ solves this. It would be good for the documentation to have this correction, so that no one else (especially beginners) will get that error.

Fixed with [SVN 7335](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=7335). The changes will appear with the next publishing of the documentation with ZF 1.5.0 Preview Release.
