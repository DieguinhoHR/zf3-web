ZF-3159: Zend\_Filter\_Int and required fields

### Description

When Zend\_Filter\_Int is used in validating forms, a field that is set as required cannot assume a value of zero. 0 is a perfectly valid value, but it's evaluated as a "" because Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty casts to string every value, so the problem resides there). In general,when value the filter chain is applied, informartion on whether the user input was "" (non valid) or "0" (valid) is lost, so I think some validators has to work before the filters.

The problem has nothing to do with "0" being cast to a string in Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty. If you look closely, the actual value that is validated is the original $value variable that was passed in. On the other hand, "0" is considered an empty value in PHP, so what you probably want to do is use Zend\_Validate\_StringLength to ensure that the length is greater than 0.

Bookkeeping. Trying to assign all issues that are resolved to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be new, unreviewed ones.
