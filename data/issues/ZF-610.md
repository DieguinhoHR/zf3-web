### Description

According to RFC 2616 section 19.5.1 parameter values in Content-Dispositions should be quoted. This causes multipart/form-data POSTs to e.g. [https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS\_WEB/Sor/â€¦](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS_WEB/Sor/index.aspx?PageIndex=Search&SubmitType=Address) to break. The attached simple patch will fix this.

To clarify, Zend\_Http\_Client does not currently quote these values, which causes POSTs to the example site to break. Changing Zend\_Http\_Client to quote these values fixes this.
