### Description

Chapter 2. Zend\_Acl 2.1.1. Resources

The second sentence is missing some content, located where the asterisk is below.

A class need only implement this interface, which consists of a single method, getResourceId(), \* so Zend\_Acl to recognize the object as a resource.

Thanks!! Greg

There doesn't appear to be any missing content. Simply changing "so" to "for" makes the sentence readable.

Committed fix to trunk and merged into the 1.9 release branch.
