### Description

I was running the unit tests provided in the full distribution of ZF 1.9.1 earlier, and found the following piece of code in the tearDown function used by Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_StreamTest:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function tearDown()
    {
            $this->_amazon->unregisterStreamWrapper();
        $buckets = $this->_amazon->getBuckets();
        foreach($buckets as $bucket) {
    
                $this->_amazon->cleanBucket($bucket);
    
            $this->_amazon->removeBucket($bucket);
    
        }
    }


This seems Very Bad to me. I do not see a warning about it anywhere, either in StreamTest.php, or in TestConfiguration.php.dist, where one specifies the "test bucket" and login credentials. In the other cases that I looked through (though I didn't thoroughly examine all of the test cases), the tests only delete either the configured test bucket, or buckets they created.

Because it seems pretty severe (to me), I just upped the priority. Sorry if I'm wrong, but this has the potential to ruin a lot of users I guess.

I've changed it to remove only buckets prefixed with test bucket name
