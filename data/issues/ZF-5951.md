ZF-5951: Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http does not compare sent with configured realm in digest authentification

### Description

When doing digest authentification with different realms, the adpater does not check if the user supplied realm matches the configured one. So if one has authenticated once with a realm, the browser will send that realm along with the credentials. This validates just fine (real, username and pass are valid), which is a bug, as the realm does not match the configured one.

Bruce Lohr has supplied a working patch on the fw-general mailing list.
