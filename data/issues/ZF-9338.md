### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha should use its loadDefaultDecorators() method to add two captcha specific decorators instead of using its render() method for this purpose , as a result currently its impossible to disable captcha decorator ,currently if someone like to create its own captcha decorator has to create his own captcha element.

Decorating the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha seems almost imposible. Please fix this issue!

    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement('captcha', 'CaptchaName',
              array('captcha' => new Zend_Captcha_Figlet(),
                            'prefixPath' => array('decorator' => array('App_Form_Decorator' => 'App/Form/Decorator/'))));
    $form->render();
    echo '


    ' . var_export(array_keys($form->CaptchaName->getDecorators()),1) . '

    ';
    
    array (
      0 => 'App_Form_Decorator_Captcha',
      1 => 'App_Form_Decorator_Captcha_Word',

Closing as won't fix as the Decorators are probably going to be refactored in 2.0 - and until then the suggested workaround seems sufficient for me.
