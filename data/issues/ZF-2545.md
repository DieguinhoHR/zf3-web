### Description

\_\_toString() cannot actually throw exception

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($column) {
                        if (!isset($from[$table]) || $from[$table]['tableName'] != $primary) {
                            require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Select/Exception.php';
                            throw new Zend_Db_Table_Select_Exception("Select query cannot join with another table");
                        }
                    }


should actually be turned to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($column) {
                        if (!isset($from[$table]) || $from[$table]['tableName'] != $primary) {
                            trigger_error("Select query cannot join with another table", E_USER_WARNING);
                            return '';
                        }
                    }

It seems to me this masks the problem rather than fixing it. Wouldn't it be better to provide an explicit function for getting the SQL representation of the query, rather than using \_\_toString? This function could then throw exceptions, allowing the error to be dealt with properly, rather than merely returning an empty string, which leads to a confusing error message if, for instance, the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select object is passed to Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchRow().
