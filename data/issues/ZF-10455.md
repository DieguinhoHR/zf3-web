### Description

When using the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql, an incorrect number of rows are returned when specifying an offset with limit(). For instance, if you have a possible 26 rows in a result set, and you specify a limit of 10 with an offset of 20, you would expect to get back the last 6 rows. This is how the other DB adapters work. With the SQL Server adapter, you get back 10 rows.

This is also discussed in ZF-8148, particularly in the comment by Ankit Aggarwal: [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8148?focusedCommentId=37247&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_37247) The fix for bug ZF-8148 did not solve this issue.

Possible solutions for SQL Server 2000 and up are discussed at [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/216673/…](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/216673/emulate-mysql-limit-clause-in-microsoft-sql-server-2000)
