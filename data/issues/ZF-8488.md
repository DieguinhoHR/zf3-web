ZF-8488: Set flags on an array of messages: store() function in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap should support array

### Description

If I want to set flags for many messages, I have to call the store() function many times (hundreds, thousands). It would be nice if this function also supports an array as parameter, like fetch already does.

I will attach a patch which adds this functionality, I hope this helps.
