ZF-1309: Unable to clone Zend\_Pdf\_Page

### Description

This class does not implement \_\_clone() and copying pages fails. There's a hint that page cloning is done via constructor and not is implemented yet:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($param1 instanceof Zend_Pdf_Page && $param2 === null && $param3 === null) {
                /** @todo implementation */
                throw new Zend_Pdf_Exception('Not implemented yet.');


This missing bit is a serious issue if you try to do proper OOP. IMHO copying object belongs to clone keyword and \_\_clone() method. And if it's meant to be done by the constructor then at least \_\_clone() should throw an exception.

I see it's an important feature.

I think it should be done as one of the first Zend\_Pdf improvements.

Done.

Cloning mechanism is not used because we need access to the source object (that's of course possible to do this, but it complicates memory management).

Exception is thrown if clone keyword is used.
