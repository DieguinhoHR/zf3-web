### Description

On the constructor the class variable "$this->\_bigEndian" is hardcoded with a "1" value, on 64 Bits processors this convert the float values incorrectly because the method "writeDouble" execute a strrev($stream), with that all the float values are displayed as 0.40998789798-E123 for example

I detected that on the constructor is the following sentence:

$testEndian = unpack("C_", pack("S_", 256));

and following is: $this->\_bigEndian = 1;

that I believe that the intention is to detect the endian on the server but it was never used

I changed the line with $this->\_bigEndian = 1;

to

$this->\_bigEndian = $testEndian[2];

Please verify if the solution is correct, I tested on my both environments:

My Linux box running: Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.2.6

My Solaris Box 64bits: Apache/2.0.59 (Unix) PHP/5.2.9

Let me know if you need more details and If I can help documenting this

I don't know how your change will work correctly because on readDouble the byte order wasn't tested before reverting the stream. Additionally this will set bigEndian to 1 on little endian systems.

I tested on both environments little endian and big endian, we have been working that way for months and we didn't had a problem

I added a patch.

Can you run Zend\_Amf\_AllTests with the applied patch and test if this working for you please.

thx

Hi Marc, I have patched and executed the all tests for AMF and got no errors.

Great, Thanks Marc, there is anything else that I have to do?

I see that the patch was committed to trunk but there was no test case commit to trunk. Do you plan on committing a test?

Also thanks for the patch!!!

I have run AllTests with this patch on 64 and 32 bit system and everything passes. We should really add a patch for when it would fail so that people know to upgrade. I am going to promote the change to the next release.

Hi Wade,

This hadn't do anything with 32/64bit but with little/big endian systems.

I haven't got an big-endian (e.g Solaris, SPARC) system to test it by my self. But after viewing i think the tests didn't fail on big endian systems.

I personally don't have access to anything without intel inside so thanks for making the patch!
