### Description

(Zend\_Filter\_Dir , Zend\_Filter\_Basename). These classes do not have hardly any construct specific.

Was thinking about future implementation. Example of the Zend\_Filter\_Realpath ??? [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.8.4PL1/library/Zend/Filter/RealPath.php) [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Filter/RealPath.php)

if no could be deprecated and in the application make calls, for Zend\_Filter\_Callback

Can you please describe what you are suggesting ? Erasing Zend\_Filter\_Dir/Basename/Realpath in favor of Zend\_Filter\_Callback ?

You may have noted that Zend\_Filter\_Realpath provides options and additionally it does not only call realpath but it also other OS specific operations.

Also to note that for usability it's better to have $addFilter('Basename'); than $addFilter('Callback', false, array('basename')); even if this means to add 10 lines of code. ;-)

All of these filters predate the Callback filter, and as such cannot and will not be removed for reasons of backwards compatibility. Additionally, it's simpler to call a named filter ('BaseName', 'RealPath') than to call a Callback filter with arguments.

Thomas and Matthew, my sugestion Was erase Zend\_Filter\_Dir, Zend\_Filter\_Basename.

I noticed the rules used in the filter Zend\_Filter\_Realpath.

Understand perfectly, incompatibility caused by deleting these classes and ease the call today.

These classes the next versions may be implemented as something specific done Zend\_Filter\_Realpath.

Understand, thanks.
