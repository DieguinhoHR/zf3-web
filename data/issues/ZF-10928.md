### Description

I have implemented in ZF v1.10.x a small ACL with the code below. With ZF v1.10.x inhertiance of guest to administrator role worked, so that the administrator was allowed to open everything of the default module. With ZF v1.11.0 this behaviour is broken - and it still doesn't work in 1.11.1 and 1.11.2.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl = new Zend_Acl();
    $acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('guest'));
    $acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('administrator', 'guest'));
            
    $acl->addResource('default');
    $acl->addResource('gallery');
    $acl->addResource('admin');
            
    $acl->allow('guest', 'default');
    $acl->allow('guest', 'gallery');
            
    $acl->allow('administrator', 'admin');
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($acl->isAllowed('administrator', 'default')); // false - expected true

There was a problem in the ZF-1.11.0 but already was fixed in ZF-1.11.1 with ZF-10649. Now the your problem is a typo.

Your code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('administrator', 'guest'));


Should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('administrator'), 'guest');

You are right, this solves the problem.
