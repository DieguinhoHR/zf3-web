ZF-3948: I guess Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Array is incoherent

### Description

Sorry for my bad english..

I have tried to use Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Array, because I don't use Zend\_Db,

First I have tried this :

$paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory(range(1, ceil($nbPost / $postPerPage)))

if $nbPost = 195 and $postPerPage = 15 $paginator iterator will go from 1 to 10

but $paginator->count() will return 2

then I have tried this:

$paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory(range(1, $nbPost )); $paginator->setItemCountPerPage($postPerPage);

Great, it works..... but

if $nbPost = 20, count will return 2, no problem with that, but the iterator will go from 1 to 10..

Sorry if I have misunterstood this component.

Il have a little problem with the adapter Null, if I try $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory(1000000000000); $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(15); the iterator doesn't work, but the count will return the correct value.

range(1, ceil($nbPost / $postPerPage)) will create an array of 13 items, ranging from 1 to 13. With the default itemcount per page of 10, this will indeed evaluate to two pages. The count() method returns the number of pages, so that is correct.

The iterator will iterate over the items on the current page. So again, with the default of 10 items per page this is correct.

You probably should read the manual and the API docs again. :)

The Null adapter problem doesn't look familiar, I'll look into it.
