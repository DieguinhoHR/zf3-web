### Description

When generating the atom+xml feed to send to Google Base using Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase, no character encoding type can be specified or is sent with the request.

The Gdata API rejects my insert requests for Base that have UTF-8 encoding strings, with the error "There is a problem with the character encoding of this attribute." When I use iconv to convert to ASCII beforehand, it works.

Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0. The classes remain, but will throw a Zend\_Exception when instantiated.
