### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_App calls the Zend\_Http\_Client::setCookie method to set cookies on the client object for use in future requests. While the GData services send the cookies without any URL encoding, the setCookie method encodes the cookie values. This leads to future 'Cookie' headers being sent to the GData services with values the server cannot interpret.

Resolved in 5202 - Disabled the use of cookies in Zend\_Gdata\_App for the time being, until Zend\_Http\_Client supports setting raw cookie values which are not url encoded
