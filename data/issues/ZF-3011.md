### Description

The following script was used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Db2.php';
    $db = new Zend_Db_Adapter_Db2(
    array(
    'username'=>"LOUISA",
    'password'=>"*******",
    'dbname'=>"xxxxxx")
    );
    
    $db->insert("animals",Array("a"=>"Serg ","b"=>"Just a","c"=>"12345"));
    $v=$db->fetchRow("select * from animals where a='Serg '");
    var_dump($v);


It fails with the following result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [01-Apr-2008 07:37:45] PHP Warning:  db2_prepare(): Statement Prepare Failed in /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Db2.php on line 64
    [01-Apr-2008 07:37:45] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Zend_Db_Statement_Db2_Exception' with message '"animals" in LOUISA type *FILE not found. SQLCODE=-204' in /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Db2.php:72
    Stack trace:
    #0 /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement.php(109): Zend_Db_Statement_Db2->_prepare('INSERT INTO "an...')
    #1 /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Db2.php(199): Zend_Db_Statement->__construct(Object(Zend_Db_Adapter_Db2), 'INSERT INTO "an...')
    #2 /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php(395): Zend_Db_Adapter_Db2->prepare('INSERT INTO "an...')

    #4 /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/t1.php(10): Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract->insert('animals', Array)
    #5 {main}
      thrown in /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Db2.php on line 72


var\_dump() within Db2.php just before db2\_prepare call gives the following result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(54) "INSERT INTO "animals" ("a", "b", "c") VALUES (?, ?, ?)"


The following script works OK:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $conn = db2_connect("xxxxxx", "LOUISA", "*******");
    
    if ($conn) {
        echo "Connection succeeded.<br></br>";
    }
    else {
        echo "Connection failed.<br></br>";
        exit;
    }
    
    $r=db2_prepare($conn,'insert into animals (a,b,c) values (?,?,?)');
    $v=db2_execute($r,Array('a'=>'A1','b'=>'B1','c'=>'C1'));

Alex, how did you come to report this issue? Are you running DB2 on i5 somewhere?

Sergey Korolyov "serg at zend.com" (original reporter of the problem) has an access to DB2 on i5. We could ask him to make tests we need. Probably he can also provide an access to DB2 on i5 for us.

PS He also lives in SPb, but doesn't have a habit to work at nights :) So if you write him now, his respond will come with some delay

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

This was fixed in ZF 1.7.2 with the new i5 enabled adapter.
