### Description

Some people prefer to transform column names in the accessor methods of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row, for example to provide inflection syntax.

Please create a common protected method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract to transform the column name from the form it is specified in the application, to the form required by the database.

Call this method in the \_\_get(), \_\_set(), and \_\_isset() methods.
