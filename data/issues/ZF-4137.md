ZF-4137: Zend\_Date toString() method returns wrong month name
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-30T15:00:54.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-08-30T15:31:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_Date->set() to set the month to '2', it returns 'March' when using toString() method. If you use the constructor to set the month to '2' it will correctly return 'February'. It seems to be a bug only when using method set() to set the month.

Code used to reproduce error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
                
    $date->set(2,Zend_Date::MONTH);
                
    echo $date->toString('MMMM'); //Outputs 'March' !!!
    
    $date = new Zend_Date(2,Zend_Date::MONTH);
    
    echo $date->toString('MMMM'); //Outputs 'February'

Because this bugreport looked really unreal to me, I decided to test it for myself. And (unfortunately), I had the same results, so it's a 'bug confirmed'.

No, it's not a bug.

You wanted to set the 30.February, which does not exist. So now the set options comes to play.

Depending on what they are set eighter the date will automatically fixed, or the day will be truncated. Seeing your results I expect that you set it so automatically fix the date.

See the manual for the right usage and settings.

Not an issue... 30.February can not be set. New initiated dates will automatically be fixed.

For description:

$date = new Zend\_Date(); -> sets date to 30.August as this is todays date $date->set(2,Zend\_Date::MONTH); -> try to set the 30.february.. does not exist -> date will be fixed to 2. March echo $date->toString('MMMM'); //Outputs 'March' !!! -> just output the complete date to see your problem

$date = new Zend\_Date(2,Zend\_Date::MONTH); -> sets the date to second month of 1.1.1970. which should lead to 1.february.1970 echo $date->toString('MMMM'); //Outputs 'February' -> also here just try to output the complete date to see which was really set
