### Description

<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

Markdown is the main formatting tool used by Github. It is very popular for comments and things, and makes for really rapid content entry.

Sample PHP implementations exist, the most popular being PHP Markdown: <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>

It would be really great if ZF had something built in for parsing and handling Markdown formats. Zend\_Text\_Markdown seems like the appropriate namespace, but is obviously just an idea.

In version 1.10, is available [Zend\_Markup](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/en/zend.markup.html) that meets this need.

Zend\_Markup is being introduced in ZF 1.10.0, and currently contains Textile and BbCode parsers. I'm changing the component of this to Zend\_Markup, and assigning it to the Zend\_Markup lead, Pieter, to determine a schedule for inclusion.

This is something we are already planning on for one of the next releases. There are a lot of people who asked for Markdown support in Zend\_Markup, so we will definitely implement it in the future.

That sounds absolutely fantastic. Thanks for the hard work, guys. Sorry for not noticing Zend\_Markup before! I'll have to check it out.

If anyone could tell me, if it's allowed to use the PHP Markdown code (BSD license) from <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/license/> inside the Zend Markup module I would like to do the job.
