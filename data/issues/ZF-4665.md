ZF-4665: make itemCountPerPage available to view partials
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently the itemCountPerPage variable is not available in view partials which makes it hard to change from user controls. Adding the following single line in the \_createPages function would fix the problem:

$pages->itemCountPerPage = $this->getItemCountPerPage();

This was added earlier . You add the same code. Look at line 843

It's probably for the best if you let Jurrien and me handle bug fixes and improvements to Zend\_Paginator. We are actively maintaining this component and do a good job of resolving all issues in a timely manner. For example, we will ensure that the changes are made in an internally consistent way. Thanks! :-)
