### Description

It would be nice to have addRow and removeRow methods on rowsets so we can keep existing rowsets up to date.

Usage would be:

// Add row $rowset->addRow($row);

// Remove row $rowset->removeRow($row);

Care should be taken regarding "connection" of objects.

Rows and Rowsets both have a $\_connected property and there should be a synchronisation between them. I suggest that only connected rows can be added to a connected rowset and vice versa.

That make sense.

While this is a worthwhile feature request, the ZF team will not develop this feature, but if a community member would like to pick up and develop it, they may make an assignment of it.
