### Description

Given XPath-Expression:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    With this expression we only get paragraphs that are direct children of the body-element. This is not the case if we have text in tables / contentelements.
    
    I would change it to the following:


Like this we get all paragraphs that are descendants of the body-element.
