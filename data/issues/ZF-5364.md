### Description

Sorry that I have created a sub-task, but it wasn't possible to comment on the original issue - it seems that I am not allowed to comment issues. The issue: I would be very happy if the problem with the missing exception handling would be resolved in a similar way as in amfphp, i.e. that I could use something like "trigger\_error("your fault text here", E\_USER\_ERROR);" to raise a "eventFault" event in Flash, i.e. the second function passed in the Responder-object. And: Thanks for this great work regarding Zend\_Amf and AMFPHP!
