ZF-11233: Smtp transport doesn't check for timeout

### Description

The send method for smtp reuses an established connection for sending mail, but it doesn't check if the connection timed out.

Of course this only occurs when running a php script longterm, as in a daemon context.

My suggestion is to not only see if there's already a connection object, but also use the noop-function to check if it's still alive.

If not, the old connection has to be dropped and a new one has to be established.
