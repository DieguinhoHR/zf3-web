ZF-8557: Zend DB2 on I5 Metadata fails if using i5 Naming
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-12-16T09:15:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:55.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If you are using DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_ON on a i5 system and you do not hard code your metadata the describeTable function will fail as the hard coded SQL statement against QSYS2.SYSCOLUMNS, QSYS2.syskeycst and QSYS2.SYSCST contains invalid system sql. You need to replace the "." with a "/" in this scenario.

I think this issue should be categorized as improvement and trivial. Because You might be able to use also non-DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_ON when connection with DB2/400 driver.

It is possible to use DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_OFF with the DB2/400 driver. However, without DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_ON, the i5\_libl driver option is not valid. i5 system applications rely heavily on using a library list.

Given the current situation, to run an application on an i5 using a library list with DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_OFF, additional code must be written to do something like call a stored procedure that runs the ADDLIBLE command to add the required libraries to the library list. With DB2\_I5\_NAMING\_ON, using i5\_libl, you are currently required to hard code the metadata so the describeTable function doesn't fail using invalid i5 system SQL syntax.
