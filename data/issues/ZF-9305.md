### Description

Hi.

I develop on Windows and use the windows EOL (\\r\\n) in my editor. When using Zend\_Soap\_WSDL to produce the WSDL file (via Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover), the tag contains a URL encoded \\r.

The attached patch converts both \\r\\n and \\r to \\n.

It looks like this issue has existed since day 1 of this class (Revision 1152), so it can't be too much of a priority (or no one is using Windows and has noticed it!).

Regards,

Richard Quadling.

P.S. I've signed the CLA and I've think I can commit these patches myself, but I don't know want to do things willy-nilly. Please advise.

Normalize the EOLs contained in the tag of the WSDL file to \\n.
