### Description

[On mailing list](http://www.nabble.com/ZF-1.6RC1%2C-DB-adapters-and-Character-Set-td18768712.html) was discussed, where is the promised [Character set option for Db adapters](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1541).

I hope, it won't be fixed by removing this point from changes in ZF 1.6 ;)

It has been removed in RC2 :(

I'm closing this, because it was removed from 1.6 README and that means, that this is no longer an issue.
