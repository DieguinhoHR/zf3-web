ZF-818: Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http to support $\_FILES variable
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The request object facilitates and encapsulates access to global variables like $\_POST, $\_GET etc.

For some reason it does however _not_ support access to the content of the $\_FILES variable, which is used when uploading files via a form.

Of course a user can extend the Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http object to get that functionality, but I believe that in this case it should be part of the framework.

My personal thought on this is that $\_FILES should be wrapped in a Zend\_Upload (or similarly named) component. There are many issues, such as MIME types, file size, etc. that are specific to $\_FILES and should be encapsulated separately. Additionally, the controller request object's primary purpose is to provide access to the request environment to help with routing issues -- which controller and action to invoke. I cannot think of a situation where $\_FILES would (or should) ever help in this decisioning.

I encourage you to create a proposal for Zend\_Upload.

This should be proposed as a separate component, Zend\_Upload.
