Attached patch to "fix" these errors but I don't know whether this is a valid fix or only a workaround.

Jan, What version of PHPUnit do you use? On my ubuntu box with PHPUnit 3.4.9 and 3.5 session tests just hang should I include @runTestsInSeparateProcesses or @runInSeparateProcess annotations (actually, if I remember it correctly those annotations were used at some point in past - then with some phpunit update, great deeds were made to simulate the process using exec directly in tests). In any case, can you please confirm that you run the session tests, process finished ok, and those errors are gone (which will mean I have sth fishy in my box configuration)?
