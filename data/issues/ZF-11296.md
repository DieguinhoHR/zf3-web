### Description

From the beloved IRC: {quote} Fri, 14 Jan 2011 20:53:04 GMT Why does Zend\_Date tell me that's not right acc. to rfc 2822? Freeaqingme TZ names are marked as obselete in the RFC, and the +XX is preferred perhaps so might be expecting +0000 instead still, 90%of all webservers give the obs-zone <|thomas\_> Yes... RFC 2822 forces to have +/-0000 Timezone no hey, the RFC still says that it should accept obselete parts if its consistent zone = (( "+" / "-" ) 4DIGIT) / obs-zone that's what it says |thomas\_ obselete is still supposed to be accepted according to the RFC as long as its not mixed. (2 digit years while obselete, still accepted 4 also) <|thomas\_> But thats 822 so that datetime should be valid. |thomas\_, the obselete 822 standard is incorporated in 2822, and should still be regarded valid |thomas\_, do you want me to patch it? <|thomas\_> That seems not to be the only problem... the spec I had and integrated seems to be outdated or partitially false. Please add an issue. There are also other differences I have to check according to the ABN[F] I just read{quote}
