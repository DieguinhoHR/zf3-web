### Description

preg\_match() is too slow with unicode patterns

~1Mb of plain text is parsed word by word using '/[a-zA-Z]+/' pattern in ~1.5 sec

But! the same text parsing using '/[\\p{L}]+/u' pattern doesn't finish in 2 minutes!!!!

Hello, Alexander.

I think it is harmful for many languages to change the pattern. Arab, Czeck, Japanese, Polish, Russian...etc

Hi Satoru,

Yes. And this was an idea (to cover all languages by one pattern) :)

PCRE could be more effective on these patterns :( It needs only 8K (64K/8) bitmask structure to check if Unicode character is certain type (8K for each type). and it should be faster than '[a-zA-Z]' pattern

The problem is in the PCRE, but not in the UTF-8 part.

preg\_match() performance has linear dependency from overall string length (I really don't know why!): !performance1.jpg!

The core of problem is PHP pcre extension and PCRE interaction.

preg\_match() and preg\_match\_all() retrive matched pattern step by step using pcre\_exec() call.

If 'u' pattern modifier is used, pcre\_exec() checks if input data is a correct UTF-8 string. That happens for each matched pattern!

It's possible te set PCRE\_NO\_UTF8\_CHECK option to pcre\_exec(), but it needs PHP patch.

Identified as an issue in PHP, not Zend Framework. No mitigation is planned at this late stage in ZFv1's lifecycle.
