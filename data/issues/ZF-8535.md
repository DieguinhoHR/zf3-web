### Description

From my understanding of [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.metadata.caching.hardcoding) there is a performance increase if you Hardcode Table Metadata (when a fast cache system is not available). The problem is that this takes a while to hardcode. A tool is needed that can be pointed at a database and generate the needed Hardcoded Table Metadata. This could then be stored as a php file (or files). As databases do not change often, this tool could be run during development and re-run after every database change.

What could be wrong with improving performance AND saving developers time?
