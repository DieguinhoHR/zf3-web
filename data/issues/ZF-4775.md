### Description

The following "there exist a few instances and problems that toe the line upon which domain the fit within." should probably read "there are a few instances and problems that toe the line between which domain they fit within".

"there exist a" becomes "there are a" "upon" becomes "between" "the" should be "they"

Or it could be reqorded as so: "there are a few instances and problems where it is not clear which domain they fit within".

It's in the '3.2.3. Advanced Usage By Example' section of [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.adapter.dbtable.html)

Hi, Simon Corless .

Which do you mean as 'the' in the sentence?

The sentence 'that toe the line upon which domain the fit within' has two 'the' words.

Sorry about that! I mean... 'domain the fit within' should be... 'domain they fit within'

i.e. the second one!

I see, Simon Corless. I solved it in SVN r12292. Thank you!
