### Description

I am using ZF's svn snapshot version 11473;

I am trying to create 4 file upload form-elements with different numbers, for example;


        $image_2 = new Zend_Form_Element_File('image_2');
        $image_2->setLabel('Upload an image # 2')
                ->setRequired(false)
                ->setDestination('E:\apache2triad\htdocs\xxxx\public_html\images\products')
                ->addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif'); // only JPEG, PNG, and GIFs

        $image_3 = new Zend_Form_Element_File('image_3');
        $image_3->setLabel('Upload an image # 3')
                ->setRequired(false)
                ->setDestination('E:\apache2triad\htdocs\xxxx\public_html\images\products')
                ->addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif'); // only JPEG, PNG, and GIFs


but results in warning, as follows;

Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in E:\\apache2triad\\htdocs\\xxxx\\library\\Zend\\Validate\\File\\Extension.php on line 128

======= My observation is that; Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension: When I put foreach loop in the is\_string($extension) check the warning dis-appears

Working Code in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension: $extensions = $this->getExtension(true); if (is\_string($extension)) { $extension = explode(',', $extension); foreach ($extension as $content) { if (empty($content) || !is\_string($content)) { continue; }


                $extensions[] = trim($content);
            }
        }


However, I am not sure if this is the cause of the issue. please look into this issue.

Please attach always the component which makes the problem "Zend\_Validate\_File" and not "Zend\_Form" in this case.

Otherwise the solution can be delayed for several weeks as the component author does not know that it exists.

This is the file from latest SVN Snapshot r11473





Posted by Ahmed Shaikh Memon (ahmedshaikhm) on 2008-09-22T04:53:33.000+0000

The attached file contains Modified function addExtension() of class Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension;

I did not mean that you must attach the file.

You have attached this issue to Zend\_Form as component. But you wrote yourself that the problem is in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension.

You should always attach issues to the correct component, in this case Zend\_Validate\_File and not Zend\_Form

You seem to be using an outdates revision of ZF.

Line 128 is only a "if" clause. Any related warning can only be throwed in line 127. Also API doc states that only string and array is allowed as parameter.

Oh sorry for posting with wrong attachment, I will take care of this thing from next time, thanks.

I just checked the svn repo and found that the Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension is now on rev 11474, the issue is still there, the same "Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in E:\\apache2triad\\htdocs\\xxxx\\library\\Zend\\Validate\\File\\Extension.php on line 127"

And you are right at line 127 its under Zend\\Validate\\File\\Extension.php foreach ($extension as $content) {

And I am passing the string, in the form; ->addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif'); // only JPEG, PNG, and GIFs

Can you add a var\_dump() before 127 to see what is given as input ? Your code and the returned error do not fit. Our unittests are checking exact your input without giving a notice.

Ok I got the bug, its basically under Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract's function addValidator

Please take a look at the function definition of Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::addValidator and then Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::addValidator

Basically options-array is not being passed properly to the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::addValidator, Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::addValidator expects the options to be given as second argument, while they are being coming in third argument.

Will you move the issue to Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract or should I do it myself?





Posted by Ahmed Shaikh Memon (ahmedshaikhm) on 2008-09-22T12:10:31.000+0000

the above mentioned issue in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract is causing the value being passed as boolean as oppose to expected string or array in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension::addExtension()

Specifically look at following lines in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::addValidator


            $class     = $this->getPluginLoader(self::VALIDATE)->load($validator);
            $validator = new $class($options);

Sorry... but you must be using a outdated version of ZF.

Zend\_Form\_Element\_File reads:


    <pre class="highlight">
        public function addValidator($validator, $breakChainOnFailure = false, $options = array())
        {
            $adapter = $this->getTransferAdapter();
            $adapter->addValidator($validator, $breakChainOnFailure, $options);


As you mentioned 3rd option is the options array as you gave it in your example code.

Now Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Abstract:


    <pre class="highlight">
        public function addValidator($validator, $breakChainOnFailure = false, $options = null, $files = null)
        {
            if ($validator instanceof Zend_Validate_Interface) {
                $name = get_class($validator);
            } elseif (is_string($validator)) {
                $name      = $this->getPluginLoader(self::VALIDATE)->load($validator);
                $validator = new $name($options);


As you see also here the 3rd parameter are the options and the last line assigns the options as first parameter while constructing a new validator.

Now Zend\_Validate\_File\_Extension:


    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __construct($extension, $case = false)
        {
            $this->_case = (boolean) $case;
            $this->setExtension($extension);


As you see the first parameter, the extensions are the options you gave in your initial call.

When your Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Abstract accepts the options as second parameter you MUST use a old revision as this has changed a few days ago. And I am speaking of the actual trunk since r11430.

Please check out a complete new revision to get rid of the false file.

Hi T, thanks for following up on this. I just got rev 11474, and the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Abstract file is fixed.

I dont know what happened, I just svn updated the zend code repo last night, either developers are fast 'n furios at Zend or there was some issue in getting fresh svn code drops.

Anyways, day is safe now.

Thanks,

As all three classes are from me, no other makes commits on those (I would have seen this), and the mentioned classes are in this version since 19.Sept I expect a svn problem.
