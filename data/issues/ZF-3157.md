ZF-3157: partialLoop helper - check for ArrayObject
---------------------------------------------------

### Description

There seem to be a bug on SPL level: ArrayObject does not report as Iterator with PHP 5.2.4. It implements ArrayAccess, which indirectly implements Iterator via ArrayIteartor.

This causes a bug when providing an empty ArrayObject to the partialLoop view helper.

Fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->partialLoop('catalog/products.phtml', new ArrayObject()) ?>


Works:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php $object = new ArrayObject() ?>
    <?php echo $this->partialLoop('catalog/products.phtml', $object->getIterator()) ?>


To fix this in ZF, we need to add an extra check in the partialLoop helper that checks for ArrayObject:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!is_array($model) && (!$model instanceof Iterator or !$model instanceof ArrayObject)) { }

Actually, discovered that ArrayAccess does not implement ArrayIterator, but vice versa... meaning that ArrayObject does _not_ implement Iterator. The correct behavior would be to check for Traversable, which would catch both Iterators and ArrayObjects, and would work with foreach().
