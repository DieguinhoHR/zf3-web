### Description

If a bootstrap resource needs a reference to another resource, one would need to call $this->bootstrap('resource') first then $res = $this->getResource('resource'), or chain them like $res = $this->bootstrap('resource')->getResource('resource'). It would be nice if they can be combined in a single call. E.g.

$this->bootstrap('frontController')->registerPlugin(new My\_Plugin());

list($view, $layout, $modules) = $this->bootstrap(array('view', 'layout', 'modules'));

bootstrap() was designed to be a fluent interface because the intention is that it is setting the application/bootstrap state. Additionally, the fact that it can take multiple signatures -- including _no_ arguments -- makes having a standard return value a more sane API.

Marking as "won't fix".
