ZF-8337: Zend\_Navigation\_Container pages reordering issue

### Description

When pages in container do not have specific order it is impossible to move first page to second position (index 1). Test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $navigation = new Zend_Navigation();
    
    $page1 = new Zend_Navigation_Page_Uri(array('uri' => 'page1'));
    $page2 = new Zend_Navigation_Page_Uri(array('uri' => 'page2'));
    $page3 = new Zend_Navigation_Page_Uri(array('uri' => 'page3'));
    
    $navigation->setPages(array($page1, $page2, $page3));
    
    $page1->setOrder(1);
    
    foreach($navigation as $page) {
        echo $page->uri . "\n";
    }


expecting output: page2 page1 page3

got output: page2 page3 page1

Another related issue occurs when calling $page3->setOrder(0) instead of $page1->setOrder(1). In this case page3 is actually set at index "1", not "0" as expected.

Found this bug to be a similar issue as ZF-8313

Fixed the issue in r19178, but once order is assigned to one page it is required to be added to each individual page, otherwise pages with no order assigned will be set to order 0 (zero), making them appear unsorted.
