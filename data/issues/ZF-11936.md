### Description

I think it's not possible to decompress a archive file which is bigger than 1024 bytes, with the bz2 adapter.

In file Filter/Compress/Bz2.php : 164 165 $compressed = bzread($file); 166 bzclose($file);

bzread PHP Doc says : string bzread ( resource $bz [, int $length = 1024 ] )

length

 
    If not specified, bzread() will read 1024 (uncompressed) bytes at a time. A maximum of 8192 uncompressed bytes will be read at a time.


I think that we need a sort of : $compressed = ''; while (!feof($file)) { $compressed .= bzread($file); }
