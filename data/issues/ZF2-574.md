--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The columns() method of Sql\\Select has a second parameter $prefixColumnsWithTable. When that is set to false, an invalid query is created.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // in an AbstractTableGateway
    $select = $this->select();
    $select->from('my_table')
        ->columns(array('column1'), false);


Expected query: SELECT "column1" FROM "my\_table"

Actual query: SELECT ."column1" FROM "my\_table"

Using PDO\_Mysql.
