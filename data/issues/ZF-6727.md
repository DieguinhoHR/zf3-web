### Description

in the autoload method the return statement look like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return include $path . '/' . str_replace('_', '/', $final) . '.php';


this results in a double // the . '/' after path is not required or maybe should be checked because its results in a path require like this

application/modules/i18n/models//Example.php

Set component and auto reassign

Confirmed for me. I get some "/media/www/anaskaformationZF/application/default/models/Acl///MyAcl.php" when trying new Acl\_MyAcl with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autoloader = new Zend_Loader_Autoloader_Resource(array(
     'basePath'      => $appPath . '/default/models',
     'namespace'     => '',
     'resourceTypes' => array('tables'=>array('path'=>'Tables/','namespace'=>'Table'),
                              'objects'=>array('path'=>'Objects/', 'namespace'=>'Object'),
                              'forms'=>array('path'=>'Forms/', 'namespace'=>'Form'),
                              'acl'=>array('path'=>'Acl/', 'namespace'=>'Acl')
    )));

Double slashes in path too.

For Windows its good, but for linux i have this error in path:

```

Looks like it is a counting error, changing ln 174 from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $final = substr($class, strlen($lastMatch));


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $final = substr($class, strlen($lastMatch)+1);


Fixes the issue.

Could be fixed by changing:

return include $path . '/' . str\_replace('\_', '/', $final) . '.php';

to:

return rtrim(include $path, '/') . '/' . ltrim(str\_replace('\_', '/', $final), '/') . '.php';

That way you remove right trailing slashes from the path and left trailing slashes from the final bit.

This patch breaks the autoloading of custom classes in my project. I get the error:

Warning: include() [function.include]: Filename cannot be empty in C:\\appliaction\\svn\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Loader\\Autoloader\\Resource.php on line 188 Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening '' for inclusion (include\_path='C:\\application\\svn\\trunk\\application/models/doctrine;C:\\application\\svn\\trunk\\library;.;C:\\php5\\pear') in C:\\application\\svn\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Loader\\Autoloader\\Resource.php on line 188

And the class being passed to autoload() is "Custom\_Acl"

Your autoload() class does not return false. It tried to include "false" as a file. Try:

public function autoload($class) { if ( $classpath = $this->getClassPath($class) ) include $classpath; else return false; }

Looks like we've stumbled across the same problem ...I submitted a patch almost identical to what you're suggesting earlier this afternoon at <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8364> . There are a few other issues that talk about the same thing too, so hopefully it'll make it in.

I fix the problem in ZF-8364.
