ZF-1365: Zend\_Search\_Lucene::close() not setting or checking the $\_close flag
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In the method Zend\_Search\_Lucene::close(), the following line should be added:

$this->\_closed = true;

This will ensure that a close() will not be called by the destructor if previously called manually.

Another good idea would be to check the $\_closed flag at the beginning of closed() and throw an exception if it is true.
