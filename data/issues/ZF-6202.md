### Description

Flash player provides a way to pass authentication credentials through the AMF header (DSRemoteCredentials). Zend AMF v1.7.5 does not reads this from the request and hence does not provide any support for remoting authentication.

The source code in Zend/Amf/Server.php contains the function: protected function \_handle(Zend\_Amf\_Request $request) which handles the request, this has a '@todo implement AMF header authentication' comment on it.
