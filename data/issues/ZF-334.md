ZF-334: Zend\_Filter::isName should allow periods (and commas?).
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-08-23T12:18:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:18.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Filter::isName disallows periods. Some very common names entered in what would be a very common way are filtered. For example, a user might be asked to enter his name as it appears on his credit card. This typically contains first or middle initials:

John Q. Public P. J. O'Rourke

Also, it would be nice to allow commas, as well, to cover the common LAST, FIRST style:

Smith, John

Although you could pre-process the entry before applying Zend\_Filter::isName(), I think it would be better to allow for these two additional punctuation marks (already have hyphen and apostrophe). This would make Zend\_Filter\_Input::testName() much more useable.

I've hacked my own fix by changing line 400 of Filter.php as follows:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    -        return (bool) !preg_match('/[^[:alpha:]\ \-\']/', $value);
    +        return (bool) !preg_match('/[^[:alpha:]\ \-\'\.,]/', $value);

Changing fix version to 0.9.0.

isName() has been removed for now. If there is a strong need for this method, we need a better design.
