### Description

Since routes are already defined somewhere else in the application and they all have a name, defining them again (or at least some of them) for caching purposes doesn't seem very DRY. It would be very useful if the Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page frontend could also match against route names.

Of course having the router parse all routes and match against the URI implies some overhead and would be slower than using the more immediate regex method available in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page. Having said that I think this performance issue should be left to be evaluated by users. I can think of many cases where this would have come in handy for me.

The implementation would look something like this: _this code sample was taken from the actual Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page docs and slightly changed to exemplify my proposal_

 
    <pre class="highlight">      $frontendOptions = array(
             'lifetime' => 7200,
             'debug_header' => true, 
             'routes' => array(
    
                 'someRouteName' => array('cache' => true),
    
                 'someOtherRouteName' => array('cache' => true),
    
                 'andAnotherRouteName' => array(
    
                     'cache' => true,
    
                     // and we cache even there are some variables in $_POST
                     'cache_with_post_variables' => true,
    
                     // but the cache will be dependent on the $_POST array
                     'make_id_with_post_variables' => true
                 )
             )
          );
