### Description

is there a reason to hold the class "PdoMysql" in the Namespace "\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter"

i think a better place is "\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Pdo" like the old class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql

thx for you time ;)

The Zend\\Db component currently in ZF2 master is being rewritten (by Ralph Schindler; see branches listed under Zend\\Db on <http://zf2.evan.pro/>), and should be included in the beta3 or beta4 release of ZF2.
