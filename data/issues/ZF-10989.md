### Description

In the coding standards docs, a lot of the 'Note' blocks repeat 'note' twice. The first example is in the first 'Note' section of the overview at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.overview.html)

```

Cf: [http://mikaelkael.dyndns.org/checker/language/…](http://mikaelkael.dyndns.org/checker/language/diff/lang/ja/new/23820/old/23772/dir/ref/file/coding_standard.xml)

Sadly, this change increases my work very much.

I will happy if you would perform separately change of new line position and correction of the character string

@Satoru, I do not use this tool. I discovered that it not only shows the words that change indeed.
