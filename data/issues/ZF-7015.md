### Description

Zend\_Form with Zend\_Form\_SubForm , If SubForm uses the name based on serialized number string, "0" string-zero to SubForm's name is ignored.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $form = new Zend_Form();
            $form->setView($view);
            $form->addSubForm(new Zend_Form_SubForm(), '0');
            $form->addSubForm(new Zend_Form_SubForm(), '1');
            
            $subform1 = $form->getSubForm('0')
                        ->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_Text('foo'));
            echo $form;


In this case, the element renderd below But it should be below

I will attach a patch to this problem. How about it?

allow a form to use string "0" in its name.
