ZF-5028: Remove "MVC" references from Layout class
--------------------------------------------------

### Description

For some reason, Zend\_Layout breaks from well-established singleton conventions, and uses a static ::getMvcInstance() method instead of a ::getInstance() method for instantiating and accessing the singleton instance.

While Zend\_Layout is clearly used inside the "MVC" stack (including Zend\_Controller), it's a useful class outside that stack. It's broken out on its own for that reason, I imagine, and is almost loosely-coupled (which is ideal). By mixing in the "MVC" variable names and method names you pollute the concept of the layout class with concepts that belong elsewhere.

Improvements:

- rename getMvcInstance to getInstance.
- factor out the strongly coupled calls to Zend\_Controller
- remove "Mvc" references from names

Alternately, move Zend\_Layout into a properly nested package, such as Zend\_Controller\_Layout or something...

Or perhaps create a Zend\_Stack package explicitly and call it Zend\_Stack\_Layout?

A truly portable, decoupled layout class/interface would be very useful, and Zend\_Layout is a good foundation for it, but is currently too focused on a sub-project within ZFW - the "MVC" stack.

The biggest strengths of Zend\_Layout lay in the front controller plugin and action helper -- these are what make it possible to accomplish Two Step and Composite views within Zend Framework; otherwise, basically all of the functionality encapsulated in Zend\_Layout can actually be achieved with multiple Zend\_View instances.

If you look at how startMvc() and getMvcInstance() actually work, you'll note that Zend\_Layout does not implement a true singleton pattern at all; it simply stores a static instance that can be canonically referenced by the front controller plugin and action helper.

There are undoubtedly better ways to do this, but most would involve substantially refactoring Zend\_Controller, and as such will have to wait until we are able to break backwards compatibility -- in the 2.0 time frame.
