### Description

En el QuickStart del ZendFramework encontré en la sección: "Create a Model and Database Table" en el bloque 7 de los code sample: en la linea 2 dice // application/model/GuestBook.php y debe ser // application/models/GuestBook.php. Eso es todo ...gracias.

<?php // application/model/GuestBook.php-> cambiar por // application/models/GuestBook.php

/\*\* \* This model class represents the business logic associated with a "guestbook" \* model. While its easy to say that models are generally derived from \* database tables, this is not always the case. Data sources for models are \* commonly web services, the filesystem, caching systems, and more. That \* said, for the purposes of this guestbook applicaiton, we have split the \* buisness logic from its datasource (the dbTable). \* \* This particular class follows the Table Module pattern. There are other \* patterns you might want to employ when modeling for your application, but \* for the purposes of this example application, this is the best choice. \* To understand different Modeling Paradigms: \* \* @see [http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/…](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/tableModule.html) [Table Module] \* @see <http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/> [See Domain Logic Patterns and Data Source Arch. Patterns] \*/ class Model\_GuestBook { /\*\* Model\_Table\_Guestbook \*/

The error is reported on this page: [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)

I can't find the file where is this text. Is outside of the reference manual ... any idea?

Hi, Alberto. Thank You for contact with e-mail.

At first I thought it is translation task, but the idea was wrong. Sorry for my poor Spanish. Now it seems duplicate issue of ZF-5101 .
