### Description

Hello.

If you have classes and a library of functions, you may file them in the same directory structure.

e.g.

For an abstract class called Util\_TypedArray and its Util\_TypedArray\_Exception class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /Util/TypedArray.php
    /Util/TypedArray/Exception.php


For generic string and array function libraries:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /Util/Library/Array.php
    /Util/Library/String.php


Internally, Zend\_Loader converts Util\_TypedArray into /Util/TypedArray.php.

My patch ([http://framework.zend.com/code/diff.php/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/diff.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftrunk%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FLoader.php)&) exposes this conversion as a public static method.

This allows me to code something like this ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    // $Id: arrayColumnExtract.php,v 1.0.4 2011-05-04T14:09:43+01:00 RichardQ $
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    $o_ZendLoaderAutoLoader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    
    /**
     * Include the Array library.
     */
    include_once Zend_Loader::standardiseFile('Util_Library_Array');


Allowing the same userland naming convention/structure of classes and libraries.

How do I get this code part of the next release?

Regards,

Richard Quadling.

I'm wondering if the method should be called normaliseFile() (or normalizeFile() depending upon consensus).

With the various ongoing discussions on autoloading functions in the PHP Internals mailing list, a normalize method could be used for all things being autoloaded (interfaces, traits, classes and potentially functions, as well as libraries as I've demonstrated here).
