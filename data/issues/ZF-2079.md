### Description

Zend\_Locale\_Data: With the 1.0.2 release of ZF, the caching on Zend\_Locale\_Data doesn't work because of an misspelt variable. I've searched all the issues but couldn't find anything similar. My first issue post (second will follow soon :-))

@version $Id: Data.php 6356 2007-09-14 19:29:54Z thomas $

In the setCache() function: Line 776 says:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    self::$cache = $cache;


Which should say:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    self::$_cache = $cache;

Identical with ZF-1884

Already fixed with SVN6269. Not approved for inclusion within the branch... delayed for 1.0.3 if approved or 1.1 when not approved.
