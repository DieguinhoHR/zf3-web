### Description

Returning nested arrays in Zend\_AMF produces Client.Data.UnderFlow NetStatus message in AS3

i.e.:

public function testNested(){ return array("items"=>array("a","b")); }

when debugging in a tool like charles I get: "AMF data is incomplete (50 bytes of 50 bytes). " on the function above

Reported on MacOSX10.5.5. php 5.2.5 ZF 1.7 trunk

Looks to be a bug in both Amf3 and Amf0

Issue was created by checking if the array length was <= than on a 0 keyed array. Just needed to make it < than so that it would not iterate any more and cause the buffer under run.
