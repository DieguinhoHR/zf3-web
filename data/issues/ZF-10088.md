If you have questions about debugging, please take them to the fw-general mailing list (see <http://framework.zend.com/archives> for information), or the #zftalk IRC channel on Freenode.

If this is a feature request for documentation on how to debug Zend Framework applications, I suggest you work with an experienced ZF developer/contributor from the mailing lists or IRC to explain your questions and assist them in writing such a document for the manual.
