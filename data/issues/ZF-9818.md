ZF-9818: NotEmpty and "0" value not behaving as expected
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-05-09T07:43:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-10T00:13:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.5 (26/May/10)

### Description

According to online manual: {quote}Default behaviour for Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty

By default, this validator works differently than you would expect when you've worked with PHP's empty() function. In particular, this validator will evaluate both the integer 0 and _string '0' as empty_.{quote}

Quick test:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty();
    echo (int)$validator->isValid('0'); // *output: 1*


Problem comes from default value of $\_type set to 237 instead of self::ALL (= 255)

No issue...

Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty behaves different than empty() because of Zend\_Form

When you need php's behaviour of empty() then set the options properly.

A lot of times Zend\_Validate is used to validate data from form fields. So, I think the behavior is correct and this is a non issue.
