ZF-10981: Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http does not render the view for HTTP 300 response code

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract (line 290) considers any 300 to 307 HTTP codes to be redirects (which is true), but therefore does not render the view for them. This behavior is expected for most of them, but the 300 code is quite an exception.

According to RFC 2616: [http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.1)

"Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate."

"If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD include the specific URI for that representation in the Location field; user agents MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection."

According to this specification, the 300 response code _may_ be a redirection, but can also display a resource, such as an HTML page containing links to several resources (for example, different translations of a web page).

The view should render, whether or not the "Location:" header is present.

We could add a setIgnoreRedirect method since the redirect may or may not happen based on the developers choice.

$this->getResponse()->setHttpResponseCode(300)->setIgnoreRedirect();

I have a small patch available.

Perhaps, 300 is wrongly assumed by ZF to _always_ be a redirect as the HTTP protocol suggests.

 
    <pre class="literal">

                 $this->_isRedirect = true;
             } else {
                 $this->_isRedirect = false;


Or, it's easy enough to re-enable the view when sending a 300.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
            $this->getResponse()->setHttpResponseCode(300);
            $this->_helper->viewRenderer->render();
    ...
