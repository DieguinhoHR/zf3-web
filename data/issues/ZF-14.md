### Description

Zend\_Pdf\_Const was initially conceived as the single home for all PDF-related constants. This worked well enough when the number of constants was small, but recent work (ZF-6 and Zend\_Pdf\_Image subclasses) has more than tripled the constant count, making a master class like this difficult to maintain.

None of the other components in the framework share this model; they all define constants in the base classes that use them. For consistency with the other components in the framework, and to improve maintainability going forward, move the constants currently defined in Zend\_Pdf\_Const to the base classes in which they are used.

This issue necessitates a change to the public API. Specific details to follow...

Done. This issue caused a backwards-incompatible API change. To repair your code, you will need to perform the following global search-and-replace operations:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    Zend_Pdf_Const::PAGESIZE_     ->  Zend_Pdf_Page::SIZE_
    Zend_Pdf_Const::SHAPEDRAW_    ->  Zend_Pdf_Page::SHAPEDRAW_
    Zend_Pdf_Const::FILLMETHOD_   ->  Zend_Pdf_Page::FILLMETHOD_
    Zend_Pdf_Const::LINEDASHING_  ->  Zend_Pdf_Page::LINEDASHING_
    Zend_Pdf_Const::PDF_          ->  Zend_Pdf::PDF_
    Zend_Pdf_Const::pdfDate()     ->  Zend_Pdf::pdfDate()


In addition, font object creation has been revamped. Font objects are now instantiated via a factory methods. You will also need to perform the following global search-and-replace operation:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    new Zend_Pdf_Font_Standard(Zend_Pdf_Const::FONT_  ->
      Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName(Zend_Pdf_Font::FONT_


Finally, the old static arrays $pageSizeAliases and $standardFonts have been completely removed. There are no replacements.

I have one piece of feedback though. The constants (not sure if you are responsible for naming them or not) don't use underscores to separate words. I think it'd be much nicer to do so. I know we have it in the PHP coding standards, but not sure if we wrote it in the ZFW coding standards (if not we should).

Implemented Andi's request. All constants in Zend\_Pdf now have underscores between words.

Updated the coding standards document as well: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend+Framework+PHP+Coding+Standard)

This change was made eons ago (in Zend Framework time) but the file Zend/Pdf/Const.php still exists. At this point it is safe to remove it entirely.
