### Description

The support of vector graphics would be great. Most PDF documents contain logos, which may be look allright if the document is printed, but most times pdf files are displayed on a screen, and then resized images look horrible (no one uses 100% size while having a pdf open). Supporting any kind of vector graphic would solve that problem.
