### Description

I tried to subclass Zend\_OpenId\_Provider to reimplement to checkAuth function.

Unfortunately this is not possible, as all class variables got defined as private and not as protected.

Just changing all private class variables to protected solved the problem.

It's mostly the same problem like ZF-3003.
