### Description

I think there is a mistake in this example (sect2 id="zend.measure.edit.compare"):

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Measure/Length.php';
    
    $unit = new Zend_Measure_Length(100, Zend_Measure_Length::CENTIMETER);
    $unit2 = new Zend_Measure_Length(1, Zend_Measure_Length::METER);
    $unit3 = new Zend_Measure_Length(1.2, Zend_Measure_Length::METER);
    
    print "Equal:".$unit2->compare($unit);
    print "Greater:".$unit2->compare($unit3);
    print "Lesser:".$unit3->compare($unit2);
    ?>

Greater and lesser should be inverted

 
    <pre class="highlight">print "Lesser:".$unit2->compare($unit3);
    print "Greater:".$unit3->compare($unit2);
