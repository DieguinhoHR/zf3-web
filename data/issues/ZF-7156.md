### Description

Greetings,

This code only creates one button (compute) :

- - - - - -


        $complete = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
        $complete->setValue("complete") ;
        $complete->setLabel("Complete") ;
    
        $compute = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
        $compute->setValue("compute") ;
        $compute->setLabel("Compute") ;
                          $this->addElements(array($complete, $compute));


- - - - - -

And this code creates two buttons:

- - - - - -


        $complete = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('complete');
        $complete->setValue("complete") ;
        $complete->setLabel("Complete") ;
    
        $compute = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('compute');
        $compute->setValue("compute") ;
        $compute->setLabel("Compute") ;
                          $this->addElements(array($complete, $compute));


- - - - - -

Hence it makes the code a bit more complicated than it should be, so if the first method was supported it would help a lot. Thank you.

Won't fix. All elements within a form need a unique identifier so that they may be retrieved individually.

One solution is to create a sub form named 'submit' with two buttons, 'complete' and 'compute'. This way you can then check to see which $submit value was returned in the form.

The second version of the code is enough of a workaround, thank you. Created a sub form would only add complexity.. this was suggested only because I find it clumsy.
