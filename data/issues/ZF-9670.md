### Description

Hi,

This is the code i use: $english = array( 'Mijn melding' => 'My message'); $fr = array(); $translate = new Zend\_Translate('array', $english);

 
            $translate->addTranslation($fr, 'fr');
            $translate->setLocale('fr');
    
            var_dump($translate->_('Mijn melding'));


This produces the following: Notice: No translation for the language 'fr' available. And it outputs the

string 'Mijn melding' (length=12)

just as expected.

Now i can suppress the notice using "@" like so: @$translate->setLocale('fr'); but i can't imagine that's the intended way to work. Note that i left the $fr array empty on purpose!

If this is the intended way then how can i get the same thing done without changing the arrays and without suppressing warnings?

Thanx, Mark

Hmm. just found out that:

$fr = array();

gives a notice (like siad above) but if i do it like this:

$fr = array('', '');

I get no notices or errors and all works like expected without the need to suppress anything. I don't know if this is the intended way...

Read the notice in detail: "Notice: No translation for the language 'fr' available"

An empty array does not provide any translations. Therefor the notice is correct.

The reason is that an language without translations does not translate anything. Therefor the notice which can be turned off by using the correct option.
