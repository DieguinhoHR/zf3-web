ZF-6502: Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules does not correctly compute Bootstrap classname
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules works to use a module with a dash in it, it does not work correctly. When it comes across a module name (and directory name) of item-type, it tries to look for a class called "item-type\_Bootstrap".

This does not agree with how things are done in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract->\_formatName();

A simple fix would be to replace the line:

$bootstrapClass = ucfirst($module) . '\_Bootstrap';

in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules with:

$segment = str\_replace(array('-', '.'), ' ', strtolower($module)); $segment = preg\_replace('/[^a-z0-9 ]/', '', $segment); $module = str\_replace(' ', '', ucwords($segment)); $bootstrapClass = ucfirst($module) . '\_Bootstrap';

Fixed in trunk and 1.8 release branch.

Line 111 in this fix is unnessesary.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $name = ucwords($name);

Um, yes, that line _is_ necessary -- that's precisely the functionality implemented in the dispatcher's getModuleName() method (via \_formatName()). It allows the ability to translate foo-bar to FooBar -- without ucwords(), it would be simply Foobar -- which is incorrect.

Yes, the function ucwords() is necessary, but it's used twice: lines 111-112

OOps! Thanks -- I've updated the code now to remove the extraneous call.
