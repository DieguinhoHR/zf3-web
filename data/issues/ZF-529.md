------------------------------------------

### Description

When requesting a relative path, the server replies fine, but when requesting the same file using a full URI (eg <http://localhost:8888/info.php> instead of just /info.php) the server returns 404.

Example:

shahar.e@wintergreen tests $ telnet localhost 8888 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. GET <http://localhost:8888/testSimpleRequests.php> HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-type: text/plain

File Not Found!

shahar.e@wintergreen tests $ telnet localhost 8888 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. GET /testSimpleRequests.php HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-type: text/html X-powered-by: PHP/5.1.6-pl8-gentoo

Success

Attached a patch using Zend\_Uri\_Http to extract the path from the request. This is a bit ugly, but works well.

Not sure how RFC complaint though, as I'm not sure what should happen according to the RFC with a full URI - currently I'm not even trying to look at the host part of the uri, just extract the path and use it. Maybe we need to match the host part as well.

In the future, I think a Request class should be designed in a way similar to Zend\_Http\_Response, with built-in parsers and extractors, and an easy access to the request parameters.

In second thought, here is an even better patch. It handles full / partial URIs better - it is inspired by the redirection code in Zend\_Http\_Client::request()

It also replaces all the comples $\_GET parameters handling with the simple parse\_str php function, which also fixes some bugs (wrong decoding of $\_GET parameters, especially arrays)

Applies to revision 1546 _without_ the previous patch (replaces the previous patch).

Thanks Shahar, I'd never seen parse\_str before - useful!
