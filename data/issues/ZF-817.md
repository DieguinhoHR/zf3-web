ZF-817: Zend\_Db\_Select::reset() method to clear internal data for object-reusage

### Description

Currently, there is no way to clear the internal data of a select object to start over for composing another SQL statement (re-use an existing select object) without over-writing the select object. It would be ideal to provide a reset() method to clear the internal data for a clean slate so the object could be re-used for composing more statements.

Thoughts...?

I think this is similar to [ZF-197](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-197).

Yes. I wasn't aware of that issue.

In any case, I suggested some flexibility on that issue:

Do you mind if I resolve this bug as a duplicate of ZF-197?

Please see the revised code I submitted for the issue:

For some reason, I was not able to include the code tags for formatting the code. You would see the revision if you could fix the code tags in my comments. You may consider this issue 817 as a duplicate of 197 but please consider the revised code in 197.

I'm trying pasting the revised code here again with tags:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function reset( $part = '' )
    {
        // find part in private $_parts array
        if( ! $part )                // No part specified; reset entire parts array
            $this->_parts = array();
        elseif ( in_array($part, $this->_parts))    // reset specific part
            $this->_parts[$part] = null;
    } 


Thanks,

The way to format code in JIRA is to put the code tag above and below the code section. Note that the ending tag does _not_ have a slash in it, as we would expect from HTML and XML conventions.

I saw your code in ZF-197. Do you mind if I close this issue as a duplicate of ZF-197?
