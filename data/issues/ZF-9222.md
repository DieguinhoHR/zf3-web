ZF-9222: Zend\_Rest\_Route also routes non-REST URIs

### Description

When Zend\_Rest\_Route is used as an additional route (see below) it also matches URIs that are not registered as responders. To be clear: It does not set the REST actions but the route's match() method returns true.

In most cases this will not lead to any errors because Zend\_Rest\_Route behaves just like Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module (which is extends), but as soon as you're relying on automatic URL building using the ::assemble method from the current route you might end up with the wrong URL.

Sample:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $router = $front_controller->getRouter();
    $router->addRoute('rest', new Zend_Rest_Route($front_controller, array(), array('api' => array('product'))));


 
    <pre class="literal">
    URI                            Route matched
    ================================================
    /                              ===> rest (ERROR)
    /index                         ===> default (OK)
    /index/index                   ===> default (OK)
    /?a=1&b=2                      ===> rest (ERROR)
    /index?a=1&b=2                 ===> default (OK)
    /index/?a=1&b=2                ===> default (OK)
    /api/supplier                  ===> default (OK)
    /api/supplier/2                ===> default (OK)
    /api/product                   ===> rest (OK)
    /api/product/                  ===> rest (OK)
    /api/product/1337              ===> rest (OK)
    /api/product/?supplier=2       ===> rest (OK)


The problem occurs within the last lines in Zend\_Rest\_Route::match (btw, there should be some braces after the 'if' statement according to the coding guidelines):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_values = $values + $params;
    
    $result = $this->_values + $this->_defaults;
    
    if ($partial && $result)
        $this->setMatchedPath($request->getPathInfo());
    
    return $result;


These lines should be executed only if $path (from line 137) is not empty or $this->\_allRestful() is true. Otherwise Zend\_Rest\_Route should return false.

Just noticed that Zend\_Rest\_Route does not work on "/" URIs (even though it accidentally matched them). Is this intentional?

curl -X POST -d "a=1&b=2" "http://api.mydomain.com/" does not trigger the postAction of IndexController.
