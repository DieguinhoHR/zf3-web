I think that the only thing that have to be done is to provide a parameter so that the names of the columns and tables will not be quoted, for example: SELECT \* FROM "FND"."PERSONS" WHERE "ID" = :where1 with the quote parameter set to false must be: SELECT \* FROM FND.PERSONS WHERE ID = :where1

Why wouldn't you use the correct casing for the table and column names?

Actually: there is no reason, it is just we used to write all of identifiers names in a lower case. is there any issue in providing a parameter that will disable quoting identifiers? and another question I don't know if this is the right place to ask: what is the status of the oracle adapter class? we are considering to start a BIG new project backed with oracle DB, and I think that we will use ZF2 , but it still has no support for oracle, right? when will it be ready?
