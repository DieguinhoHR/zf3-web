ZF-2797: Alternative to Zend\_Form.processAjax() with support for more formats

### Description

Zend\_Form.processAjax() produces JSON from the form data. There are a couple of disadvantages to this approach:

1) Currently, only JSON is supported, but developers often use XML or other formats for AJAX 2) Zend\_Form now must know about JSON and any other format that it might support 3) There is no easy way to extend form to add support for other formats- it would require a sub-class of form just to add an alternative format and would by necessity have to add to or alter the API.

There is another design that might work better. Building a form-data to transport-data converter interface and implementing a JSON and XML convertor would separate concerns better and allow developers to easily implement the converter interface to output whatever format they care to. Something like the following should suffice:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Zend_Form_Converter
    {
       convert($data);
    }

Maybe a view or action helper would be more appropriate in our architecture?

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
