### Description

Some of the tests for the selected components include calls to the PHP function date\_default\_timezone\_set() to change the date.timezone to allow the their tests to execute correctly. The problem is that these test don't change it back to its previous value after the test has executed, therefore changing the test environment and invalidating any tests which execute after wards.
