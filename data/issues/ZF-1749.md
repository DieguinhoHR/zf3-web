### Description

_Summary_ When calling Zend\_Gdata\_App::get, the following fatal error is encountered:

bq. Call to a member function setConfig() on a non-object

This is caused because get attempts to reference $client instead of $this->\_httpClient.

_Regression_ This was first introduced in r5162. Affects ZF 1.0 RC2 and later.

_Notes_ \* No workaround is currently available. \* Unit tests need to be expanded to cover this function.

I wasn't sure weather to categorize this as critical or not. It does cause crashing and comprises part of the module's core functionality, so it fits the description. However, it seems that none of the higher level functions are calling this or we would have noticed it by now. The only reason I spotted it was because I was writing a debug tool that was calling the low level GData functions.

I have a patch for this baked up. I'll send it to Ryan once I get back to a WiFi connection.

My patch doesn't address the lack of unit tests, which seems to apply to almost all of App.php. Perhaps this should be opened as a separate bug?
