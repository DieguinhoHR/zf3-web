ZF-6655: Zend\_Currency::toCurrency(): wrong display with use of "precision"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-14T09:16:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-05-16T07:35:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.0 (31/Jul/09)

### Description

I've tried the following code:

 $currency = new Zend\_Currency('de\_DE'); echo $currency->toCurrency(34567.43212, array('precision' => 2)); echo $currency->toCurrency(34567.43212, array('precision' => 0));

The first echo returns "34.567,43 €" as it should. The second echo should return "34.567 €" but it returns "34.567.00 €". I guess with versions 1.7.x of ZF that problem didn't exists.

Hello Thomas,

okay I've tried the format-options in the array. Like that: echo $currency->toCurrency(34567.43212, array('precision' => 0, 'format' => '#,##0'))

Hello Thomas,

okay I've tried the format-options in the array. Like that: echo $currency->toCurrency(34567.43212, array('precision' => 0, 'format' => '#,##0')) But I always get an error "'#,##0' is not a known locale." I've tried different format tags, but only "0" worked without an error. But the result was the same old mistake "34.567.00 €". So how will I get "34.567 €"??
