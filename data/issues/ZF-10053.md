### Description

There is a lot of including in zend framework. To speedup the framework you should use the line:

class\_exists(%classname%, false) || include %file%

is faster than include\_once after the first time you try to include\_once a file

same for require\_once of course

This is a micro-optimization at best, and can lead to a number of issues when dependencies are loaded in different ways.

For ZF2, we will be using autoloading only. However, this is a significant BC break, which is why we will not change until that point.

If you wish to speed up the framework, you can make it autoload-friendly _now_ using the unix commands "find" and "sed"; we detail how to do this in the performance appendix of the manual ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html)).
