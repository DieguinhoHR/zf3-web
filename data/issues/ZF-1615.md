ZF-1615: Content-type header is not cleared out when sending a GET request after a POST request
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When sending a GET request after sending a POST request with parameters, the GET request will still send the Content-type header even after resetParameters() was called.

Reproduction code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="http://localhost/info.php">http://localhost/info.php</a>');
    $client->setParameterPost(array(
            'bla' => 'foo',
            'bli' => 'bar'
    ));
    
    $client->request('POST');
    echo $client->getLastRequest();
    
    $client->resetParameters();
    
    $client->request('GET');
    echo $client->getLastRequest();

This was actually caused by $this->enctype being used to set Content-type header even on non POST requests.

Fixed in r. 5439.
