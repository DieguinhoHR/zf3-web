### Description

This is the error I get when passing null value to XML-RPC server:

PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Nil' not found in ZendFramework/library/Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php on line 313

It occurs in 1.9.2 version, for some reason in Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php near 313 are added require onces for each type in switch-case, which was not the case in 1.9.1, but not before using Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Nil.

Same problem exists in method getXmlRpcValue() line #151, again switch-case with no require once statements.

Suggested patch to Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php (line # 313).

Same problem exists in method getXmlRpcValue() line #165, again switch-case with no require once statements, I don't see that line is changed.

Error was:

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Integer' not found in Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php on line 165

I can find the change to be related to your indication at SVN r17759 in 1.9 branch. I changed in only trunk now ( at SVN 18130).

I will be happy if you ensure with trunk's code. If it works fine, I will merge this changes into 1.9 branch.
