### Description

Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Csv is not working perfectly in the below situation :-

It is working for two columns input and output is an array with [first\_column]=>second\_column. Where first\_column is the key and 2nd column is the value.

Now If I have some input file with more than 2 columns and I need all information. It will not work.

In Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Csv :: \_loadTranslationData() method , we are doing the the below,

$this->\_data[$locale][$data[0]] = $data[1]; //hard coding the row number. Instead of that we can do some validation and then

$this->\_data[$locale][] = $data;

could you please check that and let me know if there is any other solution

Thank you, Mukul

The described Issue is not reproducable with the actual release.

When there are 2 rows than the value is attached as string, else they are attached as array because then they are plural notations.

You should not that the manual clearly describes that plural translations only work AS WITH ZF 1.9.
