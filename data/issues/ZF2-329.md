### Description

When I POST an empty form field the validator return error and break the process.

This is one of the variation I tried:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->add($factory->createInput(array(
        'name'       => 'based_on_activity_id',
        'required'   => false,
        'allow_empty'=> true,
        'validators' => array(
            array(
                'name' => 'Digits',
                'options' => array(
                'allowEmpty' => true,
                'required'   => false,
                    'messages' => array(
                        'notDigits' => "based_on_activity_id accept only integers",
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    )));

The default "Value is required and can't be empty"

Can you dump the array that is being passed to the input filter, please, so we can verify the value is not present?
