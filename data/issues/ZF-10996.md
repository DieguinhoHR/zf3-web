Hi,

Can you be more precise: - ISBN is just a variant of EAN13 (with something like ISBN 978-3-16-148410-0 at the top of the barcode?) => [ISBN example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN) - which GS1? => [Types of barcodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes)

Hi,

I'm not into barcodes that well ;)

As your link about ISBN: It seems that it is an variant of EAN-13, but it has some specific things. Is far as i can see, the 'bookland' or country code is 978 or 979. The 'code' above the barcode is the ISBN-10 (= EAN-10?) format (so different check digit).

About the GS1, as far as my memory goes: i was aiming a GS1-Databar.

I'll try to get some more information.

ISBN is no barcode variant. But publishers use EAN13 or EAN10/UAN barcodes to display ISBN numbers. This makes ISBN not a barcode standard.

GS1 is the following company of EAN... all EAN barcodes habe been superceeded by GS1. GS1 defines about 10-15 different barcode variants.
