ZF-6849: Default decorators overloading - very ineffective

### Description

When I create Zend\_Form with .ini file and I add my decorators to some element - I automatically delete all default decorators. Not good.

I suggest to remove this line:

 
        if (empty($decorators)) {


from Zend\_Form\_Element::loadDefaultDecorators()

Why it's necessary to do this IF?

When providing decorators via configuration or during instantiation, the assumption is that these are the _only_ decorators you will be using. If we make the assumption instead that these are adding decorators, configuring decorators becomes much more difficult and problematic -- what if you want to override the entire set? what if you want to prepend the default decorators with the ones from configuration? Altogether, it's an easier and more consistent story to simply say that if you are providing decorators in configuration, these are the _exact_ decorators you want to use.

Marking as "Won't Fix".

Maybe we can add some option into INI file which will force to load default decorators?

In such a case I will able to setup my own decorators and THEN load defaults. Or vice versa.

There are already too many edge cases we serve at this point. You can certainly extend the loadDefaultDecorators() method to do this if you would like within your own extending classes, but it will not be a standard feature of Zend\_Form.
