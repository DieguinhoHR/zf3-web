### Description

Three unit tests errors occur if ext/gmp and ext/bcmath extension are disabled:

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

To prevent the big int issue when no big int extension is available, you could simply use the Zend\_Locale\_Math class which was created to allow big int usage without having a big int extension available.

Look if it fit's your need in this case, and give me response if not so we can look if we can extend it to fit also your needs.

Using Zend Framework 1.5.2 I still get the same problems as originally quoted here. Thomas has provided some information on the elements that have triggered this. Can you have a look at it again please.

I also came across the same problem using 1.5.2

Been debating what the behavior should be ! Users should still be able to openid without the big int, right ? Or not ? :)

It is not possible to reuse Zend\_Locale\_Math for OpenID as it doesn't provide necessary precision.

Skip tests in case of unavailable big-math extension. Zend\_OpenId is not able to work without them.

Just for information...

How much precision do you need ? And would it work if you increase the precision to what you need ?

Orinally there was a precision limit of 200 then we reduced it to 20 and now it's at 10 because the expectation from the devteam was that generally no one needs such a high precision. How ever, Zend\_Locale\_Math was designed to allow BCMath calculations without the extension as Zend\_Locale itself is in need of it and must be available even without the extension.

If Zend\_OpenId would work with a higher precision I would also increase it within Zend\_Locale\_Math. Keep in mind that Zend\_Locale\_Math itself uses bcmath when available but has a buildin fallback if it's not available. So there is no performance issue.

OpenID needs at least 1024-bit precision, but Zend\_Locale\_Match\_PhpMath works with regular (long/double) numbers which can't provide more than 64-bit precision.

It would be nice if this exception would be more verbose ('The system doesn't have proper big integer extension' does not tell you what to do to solve the problem), or at least if it was documented in the manual that Zend\_OpenID requires either BCMath or GMP. Currently, [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.openid.introduction.html) only mentions "Zend\_OpenId takes advantage of the GMP extension, where available. Consider enabling the GMP extension for enhanced performance when using Zend\_OpenId."
