### Description

From an email on 15th March, 2007 by Olivier Sirven:-

There is a fatal error in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp: PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Loader' not found in /home/httpd/phpinclude/ZendFramework/Zend/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php on line 175

To be more specific I use Zend\_Mail in a very simple script which does not make use of Zend\_Loader so I think Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp should always includes it
