### Description

Autodiscover params from route because now if I have to provide both route and its defaults (module, controller etc). For example, now I add page like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->navigation()->addPage(array('label' => 'Articles', 'route' => 'Content_Articles', 'module' => 'content', 'controller' => 'articles', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'Content_Articles', 'privilege' => 'view'));


instead of much shorter

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->navigation()->addPage(array('label' => 'Articles', 'route' => 'Content_Articles', 'resource' => 'Content_Articles', 'privilege' => 'view'));


It can be done via:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (isset($page['route'])) {
                $defaults = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRouter()->getRoute($page['route'])->getDefaults();
                foreach ($defaults as $key => $value) {
                    if (!isset($page[$key])) {
                        $page[$key] = $value;
                    }
                }
            }

Yes, this would be the desired implementation. However, as mentioned in other issues and vaguely in the docs, the interfaces in the routing subsystem don't allow retrieving current/active route, nor retrieving a specific route given its name. This will be fixed in ZF 2.0. Until then, I suggest you make a custom page class that works against the routing system as you know it in your application.

Will be fixed in zf 2.0, not before.
