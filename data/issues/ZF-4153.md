### Description

From Simon Corless:

{quote} It would be good if the view helper tried to detect the paginator instance in the view itself. The docs suggest calling it $view->paginator would it not make sense for the helper to use this by default unless another instance is supplied in the helper call? {quote}

Not sure this is possible, but worth looking into.
