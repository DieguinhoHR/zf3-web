### Description

The Zend\_Json\_Expr proposal is very small and simple and is a very important component for the 1.7 release. Since its newly included javascript library support (Dojo and jQuery) who may very much relay on executable javascript in Json.

The author of the proposal needs to mark it as ready for recommendation before we will review it for inclusion.

The proposal has been approved; simply waiting for the author to commit the code.

Closing issue since we're tracking on this in the proposal process.
