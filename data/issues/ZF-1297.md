### Description

I've had a look and I can't see an issue raised about this.

In the documentation for writing plugins in the example there is a call to Zend\_Controller\_Front::setRouter() and the documentation shows an instance of Zend\_Controller\_Router being passed to the method, this class does not exist and it could be misleading. I have attached a patch that removes the call, as it is not really needed.
