ZF-10930: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract->query doesn't cache the prepared statement for a given SQL query

### Description

- Problem

Calling Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract->query() many times (ie. thousands) with the same SQL query string (using bind parameters) results in much wasted time performing instanciation of the same Zend\_Db\_Statement object. See screenshot 1 from xhprof.

In particular, Zend\_Db\_Statement::\_parseParameters is using preg\_split and \_stripQuoted which are very costly in time and memory.

- Proposed solution

I have a proposed patch which statically caches the prepared statement for the given SQL string statement:

- Conclusion

Probably we are using zend\_db in a very special use case, but this patch saves 10% of execution time of a very large batch script, and avoids allocating a total of 400Mb of memory over the run of our script. Please confirm if it will be included in Zend or I'll have to add the code in our parent classes.

I wanted to post xhprof screenshots but cant find the feature to upload images on here.

Im closing this as not an issue.

The query method returns an instance of the statement class, which would be your 'cached' query, if you wish to re-use it, then you should re-use the statement returned, rather than forcing this into the adapter.

This behaviour is very similar to the manner in which PDO creates its prepared statements, and so would be expected by the majority of users.
