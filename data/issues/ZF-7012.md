### Description

It would be great, if while creating a container will be possible to specify a title to a menu. For instance let's take the code from docs:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    /*
     * Create a container from an array
     *
     * Each element in the array will be passed to
     * Zend_Navigation_Page::factory() when constructing.
     */
    $container = new Zend_Navigation(
    'title'=>'My Login Menu',
    'content=> array(
        array(
            'label' => 'Page 1',
            'id' => 'home-link'
        ),
        array(
            'label' => 'Zend',
            'uri' => '<a href="http://www.zend-project.com/">http://www.zend-project.com/</a>',
            'order' => 100
        ),


which will output for example

 
    <pre class="highlight">


#### `My Login Menu`


    FirstPage>
    second Page

I don't think the requested feature simplifies things at all. As I see it, it's much easier to manually write the desired markup around the menu, typically with your h4 tag and a div, or something. If titles were to be handled in the helper, we'd have to make a decision on the markup (h3, h4, h5, div or not, etc), which would be unsatisfactory for a lot of users, no matter what the outcome is.

How to "package" the menu with markup is in fact a perfect layout task.

Closing this now.
