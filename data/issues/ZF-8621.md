### Description

For use in our company product I've developed some additional features for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract (or an extending class). Currently they live in an extended class in our code, but I think they might be useful for other people too.

Here's a short overview of the functions: \_getReference($ruleKey): Get reference (part from reference map) for $ruleKey.

\_tableToReference(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract $table): Return the string reference to the table so it can be used in functions requiring the string reference.

isValidReference(): Check if this row can be used as a valid reference (I.e. saved and PK not modified).

setReference(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract $row, $ruleKey = null): Modify columns in this so they reference $row according to $ruleKey.

unsetReference($table, $ruleKey = null): Inverse behaviour of setReference.

createDependentRow($table, $ruleKey = null): Create a new row from the dependent table, set references to $this and return the row.

createDependentRowByRule($ruleKey): Same as above, except that it only needs a ruleKey.

findParentRowByRule($rule): Find parent row by rule instead of by table (rule is always unique).

Some of these functions could easily be used from within \_\_call, making references between tables even easier than they were. Also, the functions that only use $ruleKey instead of a table class or definition identifier will make it easier for people to rename table classes as long as the rule keys stay the same, or move between table classes and table definitions.

I will attach my abstract class implementing these functions.
