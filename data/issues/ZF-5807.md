### Description

I have used a Dojo Subform to display a multipage form. In one of the Subforms I have two elements using a view script. Here is the element definition:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement('TextBox', 'from', array(
        'label'=>'ID Number',
        'decorators'=>array(
            array('ViewScript', array('viewScript'=>'form/element/fromelement.phtml'))
        )
    ));


And the viewscript as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->{$this->element->helper}(
        $this->element->getFullyQualifiedName(),
        $this->element->getValue(),
        $this->element->getDijitParams(),
        $this->element->getAttribs()
    ); ?>


This does not output a Dojo TexBox but if i change the id from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->element->getFullyQualifiedName(),


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->element->getName(),


It works.

_Note:_ This is a subform so the ID is "details[from]" as fullyqualifiedname but "from" when not fully qualified. I also gave the name explicitly as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->{$this->element->helper}(
        'details[from]',
        $this->element->getValue(),
        $this->element->getDijitParams(),
        $this->element->getAttribs()
    ); ?>


And it still doesnt work, so i'm thinking it is a problem with the ID when passed with sqaure brackets.

You should use the 'DigitElement' decorator, not the 'ViewScript' decorator, with dojo form elements.

I need some custom mark up with it. Specifically a button right after the textbox. Besides it's not to do with the Decorator at all is it. Its to do with the TextBox Helper i think. I'll check the TextBox helper individually and see what happens.

It works if i use TextBox helper ($this->textBox(...) or anyother dojo helper but it does'nt work inside a viewScript of a ViewScript decorator. I need to use the ViewScript decorator as i need some addtional markup that goes with this element. I understand that the 'DijitElement' is the equivalent of 'ViewHelper' for Zend\_Form. But I need something equivalent to 'ViewScript' decorator. I'm currently using the 'ViewScript' decorator and it is causing the above issue.
