ZF-8551: Allow adding multiple fields of same name to Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document

### Description

The [Apache Lucene documentation suggests](http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_2_0/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Document.html#add(org.apache.lucene.document.Fieldable)) that it's possible to add multiple fields of the same name to a single document; Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document's implementation, on the other hand, does not support this due to the fact that the $\_fields array is keyed by field name.

I'm not sure if this is supportable; I did note in the manual that ZF's Lucene implementation is 2.1-compatible, so if this is a 2.2-only feature I could understand it not being available. All the same, it could potentially be a helpful addition, and I thought I'd mention it :)

Any ideas?

Thanks! Adam
