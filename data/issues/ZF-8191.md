### Description

I changed the inflectorTarget so I have the context it to have all views in a context in same (sub)directory ":controller/:context:action.:suffix" if we hav a context. But when I do so I am not able anymore to jump to other modules by using the actionStack in the controller, the \_forward syntax or the action helper in the view itself.

addition: you can jump through the module (different controller, action etc.) but it does'nt mater what module you choose, you will stay in the module you started.

Detached Zend\_Filter\_Inflector from assigned components. The filter itself works as expected.
