ZF-8760: Cookie encoding

### Description

It might be a problem with "Zend\_Http\_Cookie", and I haven't checked the RFCs. But I had to modify Http/Client.php (1.9.6) as follows

1008,1011c1008,1009 < # $cookstr = $this->cookiejar->getMatchingCookies($this->uri, < # true, Zend\_Http\_CookieJar::COOKIE\_STRING\_CONCAT); < $cookstr = preg\_replace("/%3A/",":",$this->cookiejar->getMatchingCookies($this->uri,

< true, Zend\_Http\_CookieJar::COOKIE\_STRING\_CONCAT));
--------------------------------------------------------

> $cookstr = $this->cookiejar->getMatchingCookies($this->uri,
>                 true, Zend_Http_CookieJar::COOKIE_STRING_CONCAT);

I got problems to fetch pages from <https://www.generali.ch>. I compared HTTP Requests with Firefox HttpLiveHeaders and could fetch Pages after the upper modifications. Firefox 3.5.6 does not seem to encode the ":" within the value of a cookie.

Maybe a bug?

regards,

Carsten

Can you provide a specific example of a header which would cause this problem?
