ZF-9709: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Checkbox Validation bug
-----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-04-19T09:12:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-20T03:23:24.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testAction() {
        $form = new Zend_Form();
        $form->addElement('checkbox','test',array('label'=>'I\'m a bug','required' => true))->addElement('submit','submit');            
        if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            if ($form->isValid($this->getRequest()->getParams())) {
                echo 'Form is valid';
            } else {
                echo 'Form is not valid';
            }
        }
        echo $form;
        $this->getHelper('viewRenderer')->setNoRender();
    }


This code will return 'Form is valid' but should return 'Form is not valid' when I leave checkbox not checked.

Workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testAction() {
        $form = new Zend_Form();
        $form->addElement('checkbox','test',array('label'=>'I\'m a bug','required' => true,'uncheckedValue' => false))->addElement('submit','submit');          
        if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            if ($form->isValid($this->getRequest()->getParams())) {
                echo 'Form is valid';
            } else {
                echo 'Form is not valid';
            }
        }
        echo $form;
        $this->getHelper('viewRenderer')->setNoRender();
    }


This bug was reported here <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3463>, but it have resolved status.

Yes, you see the difference between first and second version is just

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    


Seems like this is intended since there wouldn't be such 'uncheckedValue' option.

Closing as Non issue.

And by the way your Issue is the opposite to that one you linked to.

Thank you for quick answer. Sorry for not super clear explanation of the problem. Let me try once again.

Let's take this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testAction() {
        $form = new Zend_Form();
        $form->addElement('checkbox','test',array('label'=>'I\'m a bug','required' => true))->addElement('submit','submit');            
        if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            if ($form->isValid($this->getRequest()->getParams())) {
                echo 'Form is valid';
            } else {
                echo 'Form is not valid';
            }
        }
        echo $form;
        $this


There is _'required' => true_ statement there. It looks quite logic for me that 'test' form field should not validate when checkbox is not checked. But form is validating in both cases - when 'test' field is checked and when it is unchecked.

You can resolve this by adding an 'Identical Validator'

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $form = new Zend_Form();
        $form->addElement('checkbox', 'test',
                          array('label' =>'I\'m not a bug'))
             ->addElement('submit','submit')
             ->test->addValidator('Identical', false, '1');


To do this proper you would write your own "Checked" validator.

Thank you for workaround. It was very helpful for me.

But why this ticked is still closed? Is it not an issue?! It seems to me that checkbox element should have this validator by default as it was fixed by Matthew in prior versions. Should it?
