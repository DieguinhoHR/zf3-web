### Description

It would be great to have batch support not only for Gbase Java api, but also for the Zend\_Gdata. Because it is needed, and it saves a lot of requests then it is needed to export huge amount of items.

Building XML your self, can't be really a solution for this task :-)

Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0. The classes remain, but will throw a Zend\_Exception when instantiated.
