I too am having a similar problem. I started getting the same error as soon as I added UnIndexed fields to my documents. The documents also contain Text and Keyword fields. The error shows up on some search queries and not on others.

Zend Framework: 1.8.4 Apache version 2.2.11 (Unix) PHP version 5.2.9 Architecture x86\_64 Operating system Linux
