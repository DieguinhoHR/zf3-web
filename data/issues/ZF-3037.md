ZF-3037: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract loading classes with @

### Description

I noticed Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract and also Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract use the static method Zend\_Loader::loadClass() with an @ to suppress errors, in particular to load developer defined classes which inherit from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row & co. If an error is found in the class definition, the script will stop without outputting anything and this could make hard for the developer to find, for instance, a simple parse error. In my case I had to add single echo calls in Zend files to find out the point where the script halts. I don't know why the @ is there, but I think it's a best practise to raise an exception from the loadClass() method if necessary.

I resolved ZF-2985 today. Please tell me if ZF-2985 causes something wrong.
