### Description

Why there is obsession to assign ID for every fieldset? If i dont specify ID i dont want to have

<

fieldset id="-fieldset">

If ID is a number (0, 1)

<

fieldset id="0-fieldset"> is also invalid XHTML

ID attribute should be rendered only if I want to and not always

Changing from 'bug' to 'improvement', and scheduling for 1.6 release. We create ids to facilitate usage with javascript, and that functionality will not change anytime soon. I will, however, consider your patch.

Fixed in trunk in r10685 and in 1.6 release branch in r10686.
