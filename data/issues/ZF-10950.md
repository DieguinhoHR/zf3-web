### Description

Currently, Zend\_Pdf lacks ability to sign PDF documents using digital certificates.

I created a class that enhances Zend\_Pdf by adding the functionality to attach digital certificates. You can download it here: <http://program.farit.ru/#certificate>

It's easy to incorporate the ability to add details information into the certificate signature.

There are a few limitations. It can't work with PDF documents that have AcroForm elements: already signed, with forms, etc.
