### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql::\_dsn() is including $this->\_config['options'] in the DSN. Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = new Zend_Config(array(
        'adapter'  => 'PDO_Mssql',
        'params'   => array(
            'host'     => 'localhost',
            'port'     => '1433',
            'dbname'   => 'db',
            'username' => 'user',
            'password' => 'pass'
        )
    ));
    
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($db);


Results in the following DSN being generated when Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql::\_dsn() is called: dblib:host=localhost:1433;dbname=db;options=Array

Fix is addition of the following to along with the other existing unsets() in 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mssql.php':

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    unset($dsn['username']);
    unset($dsn['password']);
    unset($dsn['driver_options']);
    unset($dsn['options']); // Add me


This bug does not affect functionality since the addition of "options=Array" in the DSN is ignored, but I believe it is invalid none the less.
