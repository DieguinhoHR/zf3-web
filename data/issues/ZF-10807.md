### Description

The dot character gets duplicated when sending mail with the dot character in the 73rd position (in reality in the 72\*N+1 position, N>0).

The code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once('Zend/Mail.php');
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->addTo('test@test.com');
    $mail->setFrom('test@test.com');
    $txt = str_repeat('X', 72);
    $mail->setBodyText($txt . '.' . 'END');
    $mail->send();

Tried it on my server (ZF 1.11.1) with this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $txt = str_repeat('X', 72);
    $mail->setFrom('adam@localhost', 'Adam');
    $mail->addTo('adam@localhost');
    $mail->setBodyText($txt . '.' . 'END');
    $mail->send();


And received this in the email body:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.END


Which is the expected behavior (72 Xs, a dot, then 'END').

Do I understand correctly that this issue can be closed?

I believe so. The code posted by the reporter has the expected behavior, so unless they can provide more information the issue is closed.
