ZF-7868: Zend\_Form\_Element requires a name to be set, but the rendering shouldn't

### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element requires a name to be set, and this makes sense in order to retrieve the element later on. However, as we've discussed on irc#zftalk.dev a name attribute is not always required.

Especially when sending via GET, the name of the submit button will appear in the query string. This is most often not desired. So it should be configurable for (at least input-submit and button) to not render it's name.

The essence is: the element's key isn't always the same as it's name attribute.

This will prove problematic to achieve, due to how our view helpers currently work. All form view helpers have an initial argument of the element name, which is used for both the name and ID of the element. The only way to accomplish what you suggest is to refactor to no longer require this.

I personally think this should be postponed to 2.0, as there are other changes with the form view helpers we need to address as well.
