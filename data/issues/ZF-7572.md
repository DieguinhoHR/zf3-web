### Description

The AutoDiscover class needs to be returning Content-Length in order to handle generated WSDLs correctly.

By adding header('Content-Length: '.strlen($this->\_wsdl->toXML())); to the handle function in the AutoDiscover class the soap server will handle WSDLs of any size.

For more information see : <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49226>
