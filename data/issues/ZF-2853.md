### Description

I've noticed that in various places throughout the framework, objects make getDefaultControllerName(), getDefaultAction(), and getDefaultModule() method calls on objects of type Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface. Those methods are not defined in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface, which can obviously lead to problems. These methods are defined in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract, so it probably slipped by. However, if one were to create the class My\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract from which all application dispatchers inherit, there would be major problems if the methods mentioned above were not defined.

I haven't scoured the entire framework, but know that the above methods are called in Zend\_Controller\_Front and Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module from object properties that are defined as type Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface.
