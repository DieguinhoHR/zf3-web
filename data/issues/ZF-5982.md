### Description

I'm trying to use multiple HtmlTag decorators to generate simple form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'fooTag'));
    $form->addDecorator(array('foo2' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'fooTag2'));


the result of echo $form is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
            


Why tags generated by aliasdecorators are always outside

<

form> tags? is it an expected behaviour?

This was a question better asked on the lists.

You are calling addDecorator() -- which will _add_ decorators to the existing chain. Zend\_Form has a set of standard, default decorators.

If you wish to use different decorators, you have a few options:

- call clearDecorators() before you start adding your own
- use setDecorators() (which clears inherently)
- pass your decorators to the form constructor (as shown in the manual)
