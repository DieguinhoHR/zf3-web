ZF-6562: Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect fails on HAVING clause

### Description

Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect seems to create a wrong query for getting the count when the query has a 'HAVING' in it.

Simplified example:

$select = $db->select() ->from('user', 'user\_id AS foo') ->having('foo > ?', 4);

// query is: SELECT `user`.`user_id` AS `foo` FROM `user` HAVING (foo > 4)

$paginator = new Zend\_Paginator(new Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect($select));

Created query is: SELECT COUNT(\*) AS `zend_paginator_row_count` FROM `user` HAVING (foo > 4)

which is obviously not working.

Haven't tested it yet in 1.8.0.
