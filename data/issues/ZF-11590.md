### Description

Hi.

I think, I found bug with setting mail's Return-Path header when Zend\_Mail using Sendmail transport.

When I set Return-Path header, it have no affect for sended mail - mail Return-Path have mail agent default value. It is right and for sending and for sending mail with PHP mail function. For set correct Reeturn Path, I have to set addition\_parametrs attribute to "-f <email@address>".

OS: Ununtu/Linux Mail Agent: Postfix

Regards.
