ZF-7955: Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract - resource Methods arent marked as "run"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-25T01:33:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-01T10:31:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.4 (13/Oct/09)

### Description

Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract, Line 664: it should be

$this->\_markRun($resourceName);

and not

$this->\_markRun($resource);

So the resource methods arent marked as "run" correctly and are called several times if dependencies are set in other resource methods.

Could you please provide a unit test or other code that proves this issue? With both $resource and $resourceName all unittests pass.

Hi,

its a little bit tricky :)

Just use the following Bootstrap class and you will see that the FunctionTest will be called 3 times:

class Bootstrap extends Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap {

 
    protected $_counter = 1;
    
    
    protected function _initFunctionTesta()
    {
        $this->bootstrap('FunctionTest');
    }
    
    protected function _initFunctionTestb()
    {
        $this->bootstrap('FunctionTest');
    }
    
    protected function _initFunctionTest()
    {
        echo 'CALL Nr. '.$this->_counter.'<br />';
        $this->_counter += 1;
    
    }    


}

====== if i would use the bootstrap method with lower case (e.g. $this->bootstrap('functiontest'); ) all is working fine. the problem is that in line 664: $resource is used and not $resourceName, which is filtered by a strtolower.
