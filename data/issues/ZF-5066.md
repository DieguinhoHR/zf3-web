### Description

In revision 12848 of the 1.7 branch, I have to manually add the prefix path for the file validators like this:

$element = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File('foo'); $element->addPrefixPath('Zend\_Validate\_File', 'Zend/Validate/File', 'validate'); $element->addValidator('Count', false, 1);

Otherwise, I get this exception: Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception: Plugin by name 'Count' was not found in the registry; used paths: Zend\_Validate\_: Zend/Validate/

I'm assuming the prefix path used to be set automatically, because it's not mentioned in the documentation: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.standardElements.html#zend.form.standardElements.file)

Matthew, havn't you already fixed this in trunk ? There was an related issue the last days which you was also related to PluginLoader which you have fixed.

Tested with actual release but not able to verify it. Looks like it's already been fixed in past.
