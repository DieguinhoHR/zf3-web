Zend\_Service\_Twitter does not currently implement the methods from the Twitter API for blocking a user. Ideally, Zend\_Service\_Twitter should implement all available methods from the twitter API, including the Block methods.

I need to update this patch to work with the updated twitter code.

I will get this done before the next release.
