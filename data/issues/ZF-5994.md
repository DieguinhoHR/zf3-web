### Description

Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover does not support mutiple return parameters.

Currently "autodiscover" class can generate only one output parameter, which called

PHP's soap server library support multiple output parameters using associative array as return type.

Here is a part of the PHP manual [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/soapserver.addfunction.php) {quote} Note: functions must receive all input arguments in the same order as defined in the WSDL file (They should not receive any output parameters as arguments) and return one or more values. To return several values they must return an array with named output parameters. {quote}

Result WSDL

AutoDiscover works with DocComments, how should multiple return parameters be specified? twice @return?

You can return a complex structure that "returns" multiple parameters with @return stdClass and do

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ret = new stdClass();
    $ret->a = "a";
    $ret->b =  "b";
    return $ret;


or you can simply return an array, @return array

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array("a", "b");


What exactly is missing in your opinion? Multiple return parameters are quite rare for SOAP (google has few hits and they are mostly about problems with it).

gah, why are there two issues for this. your second one is much clearer. I see the use case now.

I will close this one as duplicate.
