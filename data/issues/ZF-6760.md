ZF-6760: ContextSwitch doesn't work with \_forward utility method

### Description

I'm having an odd issue with \_forward and ContextSwitch, which looks like it could be a ZF bug. I'm switching the output format using the ContextSwitch helper in my controller's init() method, which all works fine. However, if an action of this controller forwards to another controller's action, the content-type header is set, layout rendering is disabled, but the switched view script (in this case, WML) is not used. This is resulting in a page being sent with a WML header, but the XHTML view script (minus the layout). It seems to be inconsistent... I can't reproduce it on my machine, but on the test servers it happens every time.
