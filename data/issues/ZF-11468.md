### Description

$client = Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $gdocs); $service = new Zend\_Gdata\_Docs($client); $service->createFolder('My folder name');

With this source code, Zend\_Gdata return an error from Google => "Expected response code 200, got 400 Entry must contain exactly one primary category"

I've check the data send to Google Docs :

www.w3.org/2005/Atom"> My folder name

It's seems to be correct with the Google Docs API documentation but I don't understand this error.

Thank's to help me !

I'm having exactly the same problem. I also checked to see what data I was sending to Google Docs, and can't create a simple test folder with the XML in the reference guide.

Ok, I fired up the Python API client and created a folder and it worked, so I then compared the XML it was sending to Google Docs with what Zend was sending. There were two differences. Python was adding a "Label" attribute of "folder" to the Category, but that didn't help.

It turns out that the fix here is to go into Zend\_Gdata\_Docs and change DOCUMENTS\_CATEGORY\_SCHEMA and DOCUMENTS\_CATEGORY\_TERM to use "http:" instead of "https:". That fixes this issue!
