ZF-3705: Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result does not check if its operating on an object instance

### Description

One of the reasons to use the rest client is to get convenient overloading behavior. However if the expected structure of the result does not match, then I can end up with a fatal error unless I manually check.

For example: $pricesList = new Zend\_Rest\_Client($url); $result = $pricesList->get(); $result->pricesxmlexport->pricesgroup->price

I can easily end up with a fatal error here if the document does not match my expectations. This is due to the fact that the \_\_get() method in Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result does not check if it can even call the xpath() method in $this->\_sxml before calling it.

a new class may be created to fix it :

Zend/Rest/Client/Result/Exception.php :

class Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result\_Exception extends Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Exception {}

and after line 43 of Zend/Rest/Client/Result.php:

 
        $this->_sxml = simplexml_load_string($data);


add :

 
        if (false === $this->_sxml) {
                throw new Zend_Rest_Client_Result_Exception('simplexml cannot load result data');
        }

This looks like it is related to ZF-3647 and the fix is very similar

Fixed in trunk. Implementation is using a simple error handler for the Xml parsing to show a specific error message.
