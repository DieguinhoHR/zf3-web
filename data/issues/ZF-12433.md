### Description

All examples and method documentation out of date [http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.http.request.html) And here is the pull request that attempts to fix that: [https://github.com/zendframework/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2-documentation/pull/340)

Thought so. This one went to ZF1 project. How do I select ZF2 fro the drop down if there is no such option?

ZF2 issues have been moved to GitHub: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues>
