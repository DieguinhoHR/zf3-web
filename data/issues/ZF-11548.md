ZF-11548: BC break in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules

### Description

The init now returns a real array instead of an arrayobject. This can break compatibilty (as it did with my app). The problem is Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules::$\_bootstraps

The following does not work any more.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bootstrap->modules->admin
    
    //It's now
    $bootstrap->modules['admin']

Fixed in trunk and 1.11 release branch. A test was added to ensure that the bootstraps are stored in an ArrayObject.
