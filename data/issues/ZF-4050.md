To mention:

Zend\_Locale will get a phone component which allows internationalisation / localisation of phone numbers. It will also add a validator for these numbers.

There is actually no way how Zend\_Validate allows such.

The problem is that in every language / country phone numbers are written slightly differently. Zend\_Locale\_Phone (not sure if we name it like this) will add this feature.

For now you can have this implemented when you use the regex validator and let it check your number format until Zend\_Locale\_Phone is ready.

No duplicate but identical. Only 2 places where this component is mentioned.

Closing as "Needs proposal". Note that the related proposal has been accepted for incubator development.
