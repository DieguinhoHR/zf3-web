### Description

I've created fairly extensive reporting system based on Zend\_Pdf. It generates reports in a loop. Each report has around 20 pages containing text, images and tables. The problem is that I'm loosing about 1.5MB of memory on each iteration. Looks like a major memory leak to me.

It seams that even simple instantiation of Zend\_Pdf or Zend\_Pdf\_Page looses memory. The script below demonstrates this. Objects are not assigned to anything and shouldn't eat memory like that. For comparison Zend\_Pdf\_Style shows proper behavior.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    start:4,076,700
    new Zend_Pdf()
    4,087,384
    4,093,488
    4,099,544
    4,105,560
    4,111,596
    new Zend_Pdf_Page()
    4,115,544
    4,121,936
    4,128,504
    4,135,072
    4,141,640
    new Zend_Pdf_Style()
    4,141,872
    4,141,872
    4,141,872
    4,141,872
    4,141,872


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Pdf.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Pdf/Page.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Pdf/Style.php';
    
    echo number_format(memory_get_usage()),PHP_EOL;
    echo 'new Zend_Pdf()',PHP_EOL;
    foreach(range(1,5) as $i) {
        new Zend_Pdf();
        echo number_format(memory_get_usage()),PHP_EOL;
    }
    echo 'new Zend_Pdf_Page()',PHP_EOL;
    foreach(range(1,5) as $i) {
        new Zend_Pdf_Page('a4');
        echo number_format(memory_get_usage()),PHP_EOL;
    }
    echo 'new Zend_Pdf_Style()',PHP_EOL;
    foreach(range(1,5) as $i) {
        new Zend_Pdf_Style('a4');
        echo number_format(memory_get_usage()),PHP_EOL;
    }

Thanks Alexander for working on it. Unfortunately I checked out code from trunk and I get lots of warnings, an error opening a pdf file and missing images.

Here are the warnings: Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/kgrecki/Zend/Pdf/ElementFactory.php on line 274 Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/kgrecki/Zend/Pdf/ElementFactory.php on line 226 Warning: ksort() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given in /home/kgrecki/Zend/Pdf/ElementFactory.php on line 386 Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/kgrecki/Zend/Pdf/ElementFactory.php on line 389 Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/kgrecki/Zend/Pdf/ElementFactory.php on line 402

Acrobat complains: Could not find the XObject named 'X1'

Cheers

one moment... I'll check it right now

I think the problem is concerned with sharing image object between documents or something like this. Nevertheless such sharing should work correct.

I can't reproduce problem right now. Could you give an example of your script and, if possible, your data? If yes, please send it to me (alexander.v@zend.com) or put somewhere for downloading or attach to the issue.

I managed to replicate it with this code. I have a decorator class, where I'm passing $pdf object and draw logo on every page. This seams to be a problem, when I render it inside a function it works, but if I return it and call render() it gives warnings.

Hopes that help

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $pdf = new Zend_Pdf();
    $pdf->pages[] = new Zend_Pdf_Page('a4');
    
    $pdf = decorate($pdf);
    $pdf->render();
    
    function decorate(Zend_Pdf $pdf) {
        $logo = new Zend_Pdf_Resource_Image_Png('../assets/logo.png');
        foreach ($pdf->pages as $page) {
            $page->drawImage($logo, 30, 530, 30 + $logo->getPixelWidth()/4.2, 530 + $logo->getPixelHeight()/4.2);   
        }
        return $pdf;
    }

Yes. That's clear, what is this.

$logo variable goes out of scope and it destroys image data.

You can describe $logo as static as temporary solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function decorate(Zend_Pdf $pdf) {
        $dirName = '/home/cawa/ZendFramework/laboratory/Pdf';
    
        static $logo;
        if (!$logo instanceof Zend_Pdf_Resource_Image) {
            $logo = Zend_Pdf_Image::imageWithPath($dirName . '/stamp.png');
        }
    
        foreach ($pdf->pages as $page) {
            $page->drawImage($logo, 30, 530, 30 + $logo->getPixelWidth()/4.2, 530 + $logo->getPixelHeight()/4.2);
        }
        return $pdf;
    }


So I am reopening issue while this problem is not fixed.

PS New syntax Zend\_Pdf\_Image::imageWithPath(...) is preferable.
