### Description

While creating my own filters and validators it's very annoying to have to add the name spaces everytime I use Zend\_Filter::get() or Zend\_Validate::is().

It would be much nicer to have a setDefaultNamespaces, which would allow namespaces for Zend\_Filter and one for Zend\_Vailidate to be setup in the bootstrap.

An example of how I would implement DefaultNamespaces

Matthew, could you please evaluate this issue? I'm wondering how such functionality would work with Zend\_Application, too.
