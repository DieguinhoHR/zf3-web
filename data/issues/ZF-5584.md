### Description

When sending data using Zend\_Dojo\_Data it is often required that the content being sent is escaped. Currently there is no neat way of providing this functionality as far as I'm aware.

I'm attempting to send a bunch of information using JSON to a dojox.grid.Grid using dojox.data.QueryReadStore to get the information from my controller. My problem is that I want to escape this content before sending it to the store as I can't see a way of using a view helper to do this I believe it needs to be done in the controller.

I'd do this:

$data = $this->\_model->fetchDashboard(); if (!is\_array($data) && method\_exists($data, 'toArray')) { $data = $data->toArray(); } else { // throw exception? } array\_walk\_recursive($data, 'htmlentities'); $dojoData = new Zend\_Dojo\_Data($data);

This poses an interesting issue though: Zend\_Dojo\_Data should likely have the ability to specify an output filter chain. Care to file an issue in the tracker?
