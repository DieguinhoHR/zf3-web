### Description

If you call $this->\_forward($action,$controller,$module) in a controller for a module which is missing the application ends up in a loop. Maybe there are other measures to prevent a loop at all but for this particular case in the \_forward method where we have if (null !== $module) (~line 667) a check on $this->getFrontController()->getControllerDirectory() and array\_key\_exists() for the module name could be used to throw an exception instead.
