Do you have the most current version of Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker as well?

Please check to make sure that both Zend\_Layout and Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker are up to date.

Yes, I always synchronize the complete standard trunk. Latest version:

@version $Id: Layout.php 10728 2008-08-06 17:38:05Z ralph $

Last time I looked for updates: today, 5:43pm

Strange, there is no version in HelperBroker.php

But in svn history there are 8 changes also concerning HelperBroker.php on 06/August/08

Ok, my mistake. Somehow subversion didn't do the update or just a part of it. Now I deleted the complete library to get a clean and fresh copy. Now it works perfectly. Sorry.
