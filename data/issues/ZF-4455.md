### Description

Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle does not work with oracle's cursors (as output parameters).

More information about cursors may be found here: [http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.oci-new-cursor.php)

if it can be useful, I will provide my implementation of cursor execution for ZF.
