### Description

The Amazon S3 url is hard-coded with the "http:" scheme:

 
    const S3_ENDPOINT = '<a rel="nofollow" href="http://s3.amazonaws.com">http://s3.amazonaws.com</a>';


Line 356 of the method "\_makeRequest" sets the uri of the Zend\_Http\_Client object as a string:

$client->setUri(self::S3\_ENDPOINT.'/'.$path);

The setUri method of Zend\_Http\_Client can accept a string or a Zend\_Uri\_Http object. If instead of a string, the uri above were an instance of Zend\_Uri\_Http, then the uri and scheme (http or https) could be set in Zend\_Uri\_Http's constructor. So Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 could allow a setter for protocol scheme and/or constructor flag.

This is all assuming that there are no other barriers to using Zend\_Http\_Client and ssl with Amazon S3.
