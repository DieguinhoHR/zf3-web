### Description

Preconditons: - Include path autoloader is registered - RuntimeDefinition is used - class with typeless constructor parameter exists Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class A
    {
        public function __construct($someParam)
        {
        }
    }


- New A instance is requested like:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    $di->newInstance('A', array('someParam' => 'someValue')


Expected Result: New instance is created with $someParam = 'someValue'

Actual Result: Fatal error: require() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'someValue.php'

This issue appears because runtime definition sets type of a typeless parameter to null.

While Di::resolveMethodParameters checks for $type==false in line 531. Only parameters with type === false are considered string parameters. All other parameters are considered class names/aliases.

Maybe it would be better to perceive string values as aliases/class names only for type hinted parameters?
