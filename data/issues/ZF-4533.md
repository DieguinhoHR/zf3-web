### Description

The visibility of the member variable \_memcache - which is the real/raw memcache object - is set to private. This disables the possibility to extend the class and use the memcache object. In my case I wanted to add functions like in- decrement functions but had to change the visibility in order to allow access to the object.

Interesting question is - maybe should be a new issue. Is it possible to add support for the in- decrement memcache calls.

Sorry, forgot to mention that the same is true for the Zend\_Cache\_Core \_backend member variable. Changing both is required to extend the memcached backend
