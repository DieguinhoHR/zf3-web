ZF-12527: Zend\_OpenId\_Provider::\_checkId - matching regular expression may be wrong (quick fix)

### Description

In the \_checkId method there is a regular expression to check for realm wildcards:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $regex = '/^'
           . preg_quote(substr($site, 0, $n+3), '/')
           . '[A-Za-z1-9_\.]+?'
           . preg_quote(substr($site, $n+4), '/')
           . '/';


The line '[A-Za-z1-9\_.+?' should probably be '[A-Za-z0-9\_.+?' As it is, if the realm has a 0 then it won't pass.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $regex = '/^'
           . preg_quote(substr($site, 0, $n+3), '/')
           . '[A-Za-z0-9_\.]+?'
           . preg_quote(substr($site, $n+4), '/')
           . '/';


In our implementation we did a workaround by explicitly authorizing the realm.

This bug is in ZF1 and ZF2 as well. Moreover the current regexp matches also a '\\' character that is should not.

As defined in the OpenId specification [1] the realms should have structure defined by RFC3986 [2].

The structure is following.

ALPHA \*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )

So the correct regular expression (PCRE) is

/^[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]+/

The line

[A-Za-z1-9\_.]+

should be changed to

[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]+

I will create a pull request for the ZF2 on GitHub. But I have no idea how to push code to ZF1.

Hmm, the JIRA markup has scrambled the regular expressions.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    /^[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]/


Therefore the line in the code will be following.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    [[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]

Dah, one more fix. This one is final.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    /^[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]+/


Line in the code

 
    <pre class="literal">
    '[[:alpha:]][[:alnum:].+-]+'


Sorry. :-)
