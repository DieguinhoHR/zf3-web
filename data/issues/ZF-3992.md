### Description

There is problem with handling of id's that are created for cache objects to save translate adapter's translations.

The problem is that $data that is used to build holds the full path string for file with illegal characters that cache adapter doesnt accept.

fix is to remove the illegal characters for tag's used.

file Adapter.php :

the $id crated in line 437 and 461 should look like this:

$id = 'Zend\_Translate\_' . preg\_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\_]/','_',$data) . '_' . $locale . '\_' . $this->toString();

now no exceptions are thrown as the id's are generated "the right way".
