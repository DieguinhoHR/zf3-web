### Description

I'm using Zend\_Feed\_Writer and I noticed that it is not possible to generate an Atom tag icon. I decided to study the code and implement this tag. I'm attaching the patch I create. Not sure if this is useful for the component and not sure if I implemented this functionality in a good way since this is my first contact with Zend\_Framework.

If it is useful but the code is not code I'm willing to improved based on the feedback of other developers.
