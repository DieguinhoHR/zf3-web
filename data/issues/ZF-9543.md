The patch should include the following points:

- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu gets a new property "activeClass" and getter and setter for this property
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu::\_renderMenu and Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu::\_renderDeepestMenu uses the new property

Patch and unit test added.

Fix patch does not attach cleanly against trunk, likely due to another Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation patch i've applied. Could you fix it up? Thanks!

I will check this and create a new patch.

Unfortunately, patch fails to apply cleanly.

I will add a new patch. The current patch is old.
