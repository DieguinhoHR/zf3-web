ZF-4610: Add Zend\_Paginator support to Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartialLoop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, an instance of Zend\_Paginator cannot be passed in to Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartialLoop.

From within a view script: <?php // $this->paginator is a Zend\_Paginator echo $this->partialLoop('item.phtml', $this->paginator); ?>

The code above throws an exception "PartialLoop helper requires iterable data".

If Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface implemented Traversable, it would be possible to use the items in the paginator with PartialLoop. The current workaround is to use a foreach loop and Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial:

 <?php foreach ($this->paginator as $item) { echo $this->partial('item.phtml', $item); } ?>

Paginator already implements IteratorAggregate, which is a child-interface of Traversable, so I'm not sure if this is a Paginator issue...

My mistake, I didn't realize I was using an outdated PartialLoop view helper. The old one checked if the object was an instance of Iterable, which did not work with the Paginator.

@Tobias: Yes, it works now. It looks like I don't have permission to close this ticket.
