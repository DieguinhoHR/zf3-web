The given code does not exist within trunk, nor is the described behaviour reproducable. The given file has only 430 lines of code.

Some lines of your code showing your problem would be great to see where your issue is.

Reverting priority as such an issue does not stop the application to work.

Within the testbed there is an empty error returned and not the error you wrote. Has been fixed within trunk r14466
