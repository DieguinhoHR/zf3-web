ZF-7596: Firefox Firebug support not working using view\_helper-json();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Using The Log Extension Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug i can output debug statements to the firefox plugin in the normal view rendering process.

The same log statement in an action controller right before $this->\_helper->json($response);

is not added to the response!

The used action controller implements the default Zend\_Controller\_Action

I think especially in such a case it makes the most sense.

By default, the Json action and view helpers call exit() immediately after echoing output -- which means that the Firebug log writer is never called.

You can change this behavior by enabling the suppressExit flag on the helper; when you do so, be sure to immediately return after calling the JSON helper.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->json->suppressExit = true;
    $this->_Helper->json($response);
    return;
