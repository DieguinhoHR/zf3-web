### Description

(Reported by danielb)

I found a "limitation" in Zend\_Uri\_Http. It will not validate URIs that have square brackets. As part of an internal project I'm involved, we to support this, and it's standard PHP syntax for passing array information in either GET or POST requests.

Example:

[http://example.com/script.php/?param[]=1&param[]=2](http://www.example.com/script.php?param%5B%5D=1&param%5B%5D=2)

URI is rejected with:

Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Uri\_Exception' with message 'Invalid URI supplied' in /home/www/cms/lib/Zend/Uri/Http.php:92

Reading RFC 3986 ([http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/â€¦](http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.htm#reserved)) square brackets are defined as generic delimiters. There is no direct match between the regex in Zend\_Uri\_Http::\_\_construct() and the definitions of the aforementioned RFC. My patch doesn't try to understand the semantic meaning of Zend\_Uri\_Http code nor the RFC, just fix the issue where I thought was the best "place" ;)

A simple patch to fix the issue is (add quoted square brackets to $this->\_regex['mark']):
