### Description

testStatementColumnCountForSelect() for the DB2 adapter has been marked incomplete.

DB2 is able to tell the number of columns in a result set after prepare, but before execute.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testStatementColumnCountForSelect()
    {
            $this->markTestIncomplete($this->getDriver() . ' gets the wrong result in this test.');
    }


After a statement is prepared a called to db2\_num\_fields() will return the correct number of columns in the current statement, even before execution. In the adapter, this is equivalent to calling

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    The unit test should be modified to account for this to:
    


public function testStatementColumnCountForSelect() { $select = $this->\_db->select() ->from('zfproducts');

 
        $stmt = $this->_db->prepare($select->__toString());
    
        $n = $stmt->columnCount();
        $this->assertEquals(2, $n);
    
        $stmt->execute();
    
        $n = $stmt->columnCount();
        $stmt->closeCursor();
    
        $this->assertType('integer', $n);
        $this->assertEquals(2, $n);
    }


```
