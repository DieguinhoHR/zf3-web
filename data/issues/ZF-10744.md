ZF-10744: Zend\_Acl->getRoles() does not properly documented or implemented
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-25T08:06:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-12-17T04:33:10.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.11.2 (30/Dec/10)

### Description

I'm not quite sure, is this documentation or code issue. Taking in mind Zend\_Acl->getRoles() method doc, i expected roles instances:

source:

 
    /**
     * @return array of registered roles
     */
    public function getRoles()
    {
        return array_keys($this->_getRoleRegistry()->getRoles());
    }


So, the implementation can not return role instances, just IDs. I think this should be documented unequivocally or corrected in case if instances have been mentioned.

And IMHO: On the one hand current behavior is reasonable, but in case if custom roles implementation is necessary, Zend\_Acl can not be used as unique roles registry. It is not a catastrophe, but not so comfortably as well.

This is expected, as there is a unittest in place that verifies this behaviour.

If you want access to the role instances, you could simply subclass Zend\_Acl:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Acl extends Zend_Acl
    {
        public function getRoles()
        {
            return $this->_getRoleRegistry()->getRoles();
        }
    }


Unless you have any objections, this issue can be closed.

I have no objections, thanks for answer. May be there's meaning to change method doc for prevent misunderstanding.

RE: previous comment

I've improved the docblock for the getRoles() method, so that it's clear that only role ID's are returned.
