### Description

Casting to string does not work properly in Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect on line 96

if (false === strpos((string) $columns[0][1], self::ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN)) {

(string) $columns[0][1] return only "Object id #..." and not execute \_\_toString method

to get string value of expression object \_\_toString method should be called directly

my php version is: PHP 5.1.4 (cli) (built: Aug 12 2008 11:58:38)

This issue has already been resolved in the trunk and release-1.6 branch. The fix will be included in the next ZF release.
