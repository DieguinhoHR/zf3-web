ZF-9657: incorrect case error in Zend\_Amf\_Request
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-04-12T08:00:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:38:12.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend\_Amf\_Request::initialize() method throws an exception on case-sensitive file systems due to incorrect case preventing the autoloader from including Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_Amf0\_Deserializer.

The Deserializer.php file is found in the 'Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf0/' folder, not 'Zend/Amf/Parse/AMF0/'

I fixed this issue on my own system by replacing

$this->\_deserializer = new Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_AMF0\_Deserializer($this->\_inputStream);

with

$this->\_deserializer = new Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_Amf0\_Deserializer($this->\_inputStream);

If I can provide any more information that may be of use to you, please ask.

Thanks

Matt
