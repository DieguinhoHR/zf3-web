If I have an object reference to a table row, I would like to delete that row. So I request the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row class have a delete() method.

Below is a possible implementation that can be implemented in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function delete() {
        $primary = $this->_info['primary'];
        
        // If the row is currently populated, delete it
        if (!empty($this->_data[$primary])) {
            $where = $this->_db->quoteInto(
                "$primary = ?", 
                $this->_data[$primary]
            );
            
            // Delete the row from the table
            $affected_rows = $this->_table->delete($where);
            
            // If the delete was successful, reset the data values to null
            if ($affected_rows > 0) {
                foreach ($this->_data as &$val) {
                    $val = null;
                }
            }
        }
    }

On a related note, how do you feel about implementing a delete() method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset?

This would allow you to delete an entire Rowset in bulk.

This seems to be implemented in SVN, so I'm marking this ticket as fixed.
