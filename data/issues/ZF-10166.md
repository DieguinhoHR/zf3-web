### Description

I pass my cache object to Zend\_Translate::setCache and when I call Zend\_Translate::clearCache() it clears complete cache - no matter who worte it. problem is that one server is used by few projects and they all lose cache.

Could Zend\_Translate and probably all other components (currency, locale data ... etc) that use cache, try to use tags if available in cache component.

I've extended Memcached backend so it supports cache tagging. So MyComp\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached::getCapabilities() return array with entry ('tags' => true) and I have implemented my way of handling tags.

It is not possible to add tagging because when a cache does not support tagging an notice/warning is thrown.

As long as Zend\_Cache does not support tagging, or a proper handling for un-tagable cache adapters, it is not possible for the I18n core to support tagging.

Tags have been erased 3 releases before as there were problems with this approach.

Now, when using cache, Zend\_Translate must have it's own cache or you omit using clearCache().

Thomas you can use getCapabilities() to determine whether the cache returns tags. If it does; it should use tags rather than clearing it all - imho.

There is no need to duplicate things which we already discussed and clearified.

You should give me some minutes to add a feature even if it's bug hunt day and I decleared that it works different that you noted within irc :-)
