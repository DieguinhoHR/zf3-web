### Description

Several (four, to be precise) unit tests fail because they expect the label of the element to be set to the name of the element ('foo') and not be translated. However, for some reason, there is a default translator which always translates 'foo' into 'bar'. Probably left behind from some other Zend\_Form related unit test? Anyway, to prevent this a slight adjustment to the setUp() is in order. See attachment in comment #1.

Attached patch which calls Zend\_Form::setDefaultTranslator(null) in setUp()
