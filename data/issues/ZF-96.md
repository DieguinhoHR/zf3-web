### Description

I'm sure that this is on the horizon, but I thought I'd go ahead an create a feature request for "keyword in context"

[http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/â€¦](http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/search/highlight/package-summary.html)

i'm not sure if comments are supposed to be used for this or not, but:

i too am so so so in favour of this being included as a feature in zend\_search\_lucene.. will make it so much more useful for me (and i'm guessing others)..

Updating Fix version, since the commits for this fix came in after we released ZF 0.8.
