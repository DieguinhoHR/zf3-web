-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-13T18:17:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-14T12:25:41.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.11.1 (30/Nov/10)

### Description

PHP Notice is being reported in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_File and 'master\_file' option left blank if 'master\_files' options array has non-numeric indexes, or if index 0 (zero) does not exist. This occurs when a string-indexed array is being given as the third argument to Zend\_Cache::factory() or when using cache manager XML config, for instance:

my\_file.xml (...)

Affects all versions, including trunk.

How to reproduce:
-----------------

 <?php include 'Zend/Cache.php'; Zend\_Cache::factory( 'File', 'File', array( 'master\_files' => array( 'my\_file' => 'my\_file.xml', ), ), array() ); ?> $ php test.php PHP Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in Zend/Cache/Frontend/File.php on line 107

Fix:
----

replace Zend/Cache/Frontend/File.php line 107:

$this->\_specificOptions['master\_file'] = $masterFiles[0]; // to keep a compatibility

with

$this->\_specificOptions['master\_file'] = reset($masterFiles); // to keep a compatibility

Thanks for looking into it. The notice is gone and the trunk version seems to work as expected.

Hi mabe

I think that have of typo in line 122. Current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_specificOptions['master_files'] = $masterFile;


Should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_specificOptions['master_file'] = $masterFile;


Thanks advance Ramon
