ZF-9939: Zend\_Mail\_Storage message part does not return when does not exist

### Description

I think it is in Zend\_Mail\_Storage.

I have some code like: $foundPart = null; foreach (new RecursiveIteratorIterator($message) as $part) { try { if (strtok($part->contentType, ';') == 'text/html') { //var\_dump($part); if ($part->contentTransferEncoding == 'quoted-printable') $foundPart = quoted\_printable\_decode($part->getContent()); else $foundPart = $part->getContent(); break; } } catch (Zend\_Mail\_Exception $e) { // ignore } }

as described in: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.read.html)

The problem is if there is no contentTransferEncoding, there is nothing returned. So I can't check for it. It's not null it's not false. I tried to do var\_dump($part->contentTransferEncoding) to see what was being returned. It's prints nothing for emails without contentTransferEncoding.

Perhaps it should fail more gracefully. Or maybe it's not supposed to be used this way.

I'll use a work around for now, but thought to report this so it doesn't bother anyone else.

I am facing the same problem. How did you work around it?
