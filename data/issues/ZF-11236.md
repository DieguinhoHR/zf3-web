### Description

Hi, in zf2, AbstractView has been renamed to PhpRenderer. But AbstractView is still referenced in some places:

- first in some view helpers, instanceof View\\AbstractView are performed and therefore fail. For example, in HeadLink helper, we have if ($this->view instanceof View\\AbstractView) { $link .= ($this->view->broker('doctype')->isXhtml()) ? '/>' : '>'; } else { $link .= '/>'; } currently, link tag is always closed in zf2 whatever the doctype is.
- then in some method documentations from PhpRenderer and TemplatePathStack. Also, note in two cases, changing AbstractView to PhpRenderer is not enough to get documentation correct. In TemplatePathStack::setLfiProtection, documentation tells

but a \\Zend\\View\\TemplatePathStack is returned.

in PhpRenderer::setBroker documentations tells @return \\Zend\\View\\AbstractView but nothing is returned.

Please check this against current master; I believe this was addressed already some weeks ago.

this is what I get after checking out zf2 right new with following command:

$ git clone <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2.git>

Is this current master, or is current master in another place ?

No, that's current. I'm wondering if some of my commits were reverted with a recently applied pull request; I'll check and update.
