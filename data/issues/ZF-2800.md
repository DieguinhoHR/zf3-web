### Description

As the great ZF feature partialLoop will be used mostly when it comes to lists etc, it should (in my opinion) also contain the placeholder methods setPrefix(), setSeparator(), setIndent() and setPostfix. This way you'll be able to use the partialLoop to loop through an array with those html tags added. For example, I have created a partial which shows a single instance of an item. If there is only 1 item, I don't want to place it in a list. If there are more items, I want to use partialLoop to create a list with prefix

- , separator
- and postfix

.

I am now forced to either write my own foreach loop, or to add a partialLoop file which contains nothing more than

<?php echo $this->partial('myPartial.phtml', $this); ?>. In both example I don't get the performance benefits partialLoop should give me.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

In my opinion, every single view helper could use the setIndent() method. I could much use this on actions, placeholders, forms, etc...

As an example, I am currently doing this in one projects layout file to get the content to indent properly:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php $this->placeholder('content')->setIndent(20)->set($this->layout()->content); ?>
    <?php echo $this->placeholder('content'); ?>

This sounds like a mismatch between your expectations of the components and their intended purpose. If you want to use prefix/postfix/separator, simply loop over a variable and append the content to a placeholder:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php foreach ($this->foo as $i):
        $this->placeholder('content')->append($i);
    endforeach; ?>


If you want a common indentation method for helpers, please open a separate request.
