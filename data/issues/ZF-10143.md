### Description

Componend: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv File: \\Zend\\Db\\Statement\\sqlsrv.php Line 205: throw new Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Sqlsrv\_Exception(sqlsrv\_errors());

In case of an SQL error the line 205 return only the SQL error message, which may look like this:

[Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 10.0][SQL Server]Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'WHERE'. File: Sqlsrv.php, Line: 205

Debugging would be easier if the SQL statement is also returned. So please change to something like

Line 205: throw new Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Sqlsrv\_Exception(sqlsrv\_errors() . " when executing " . $this->\_originalSQL);

I don't agree, this is not the intention of exception messages. If you want to retrieve the original query you should catch the exception, and use the db profiler in order to get the actual query/queries.
