### Description

See <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45244&edit=2>

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server appears to rely on serialized objects being converted to a "displayable" as opposed to "storeable" form. When an object with protected properties is serialized, serialize() inserts NULL characters before the representation of the protected property.

For an object of a class defined thus:

class Task {

 
    public $_id;
    protected $_name;
    protected $_description;
    protected $_key;
    public function setName($name) {$this->_name = $name;}
    public function setId($description) {$this->_description = $description;}
    public function setKey($key) {$this->_key = $key;}


}

serialize() generates the following:

O:4:"Task":5:{s:3:"key";s:0:"";s:6:"_\_id";s:1:"1";s:8:"_\_name";s:6:"Task 1";s:15:"\*\_description";s:21:"This is my first task";s:7:"\*\_key";s:0:"";}

What's not clear from above is that the property definition for \_id is actually : s:6:"[NULL]\*[NULL]\_id";s:1:"1";

Some part of XmlRpc\_Server appears to be using string methods which determine a NULL character to be the end of a string, so the NULLs in the above serialised string cause the server to break when packaging it into a response.

So when XmlRpc\_Server->handle() is called and the above is returned, it dispatches the following to the client within the response payload:

O:4:"Task":5:{s:3:"key";s:0:"";s:6:"

The client then can't call unserialize() on this value as much of the object definition is missing.

XML does not handle null bytes at all. Encode your serialized object as a base64 string and everything will work fine. I've added a test to verify that it works. See Zend\_XmlRpc\_ValueTest::testMarshalSerializedObjectAsBase64.
