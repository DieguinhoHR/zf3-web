ZF-9646: Wrong MIME type if no finfo or mime\_content\_type
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If finfo or mime\_content\_type aren't available, file type will always be application/octet-stream, even if $\_FILES[xxx]['type'] is correct mime.

The correct behaviour would be to check if $\_FILES submit a MIME and return this instead or at least decide the user wich to return.
