ZF-1752: DocumentQuery and ListQuery do not require exception class before throwing exception
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-07-22T20:48:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T10:26:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_Spreadsheets\_DocumentQuery and Zend\_Gdata\_Spreadsheets\_ListQuery do not require Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Exception before throwing said exception. As a result, if any errors are encountered a class not found exception is thrown instead of something more informative.

Unit tests also need to be added to these classes (and CellQuery) to make sure that failure cases are handled appropriately.
