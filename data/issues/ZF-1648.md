### Description

Currently 2 DB2 tests are skipped because the schema retrieved by DB2 is incorrect:

testSelectFromQualified(Zend\_Db\_Select\_Db2Test) Db2 does not report its schema as we expect. testSelectJoinQualified(Zend\_Db\_Select\_Db2Test) Db2 does not report its schema as we expect.

The schema is retrieved from the utility class tests/Zend/Db/TestUItil/Db2.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getSchema()
    {
       $server = db2_server_info($this->_db->getConnection());
       return $server->DB_NAME;
    }


This actually returns the database name, not the schema name.

Suggest using the describeTable() method to retrieve the schema used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      public function getSchema()
      {        
         $desc = $this->_db->describeTable('zfproducts');
         return $desc['product_id']['SCHEMA_NAME'];
      }


I will upload the patch plus the changed DB2 test case.
