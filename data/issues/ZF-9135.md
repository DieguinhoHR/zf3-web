### Description

Hi, I'm trying to autogenerate a wsdl from a class.

This class has an attribute like "adapter" and this adapter's type is an interface (let's say FooInterface)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Service
    {
       /**
        * @var FooInterface
        */
       protected $_adapter
    }
    
    class Service_Adapter_Bar1 implements FooInterface {}
    
    class Service_Adapter_Bar2 implements FooInterface {}


as adapter can be any Bar1 or Bar2 setting type as the interface is logical (wrong perhaps I don't know).

when zend wsdl tries to parse this, it creates an error that FooInterface does not exists on DefaultComplex strategy (Cannot add a complex type FooInterface that is not an object or where class could not be found in 'DefaultComplexType' strategy).

This is because of a check there which is like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(!class_exists($type)) {
        require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Exception.php";
        throw new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Exception(sprintf(
            "Cannot add a complex type %s that is not an object or where ".
            "class could not be found in 'DefaultComplexType' strategy.", $type
    ));


class\_exists function does not work for interfaces so you should also include interface\_exists check there too like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!class_exists($type)) {
        if (!interface_exists($type)) {
            require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Exception.php";
            throw new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Exception(sprintf(
                "Cannot add a complex type %s that is not an object or where ".
                "class could not be found in 'DefaultComplexType' strategy.", $type
            ));
        }
    }


this control first checks for classes and second for interfaces.

This can be also be currently solved by creating your own strategy, same as defalutcomplex (copy-paste) and add the interface check there. While instanciating the autodiscover class you should use it like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autodiscover = new Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover('My_Soap_Wsdl_Strategy_MyComplex');


I'm not really sure if this is a bug, or defaultcomplex should implement it or not bug I suppose it should.

thanks

I don't understand this issue, how can you return an interface from a SOAP method? You cannot set public properties on an interface, i don't see the use-case here.

Yes you are possibly right, I was not returning the interface but a class which was implementing that interface. As the instance was not just one class, I had thought to return the interface. But as I cannot use methods from a soap call this becomes very useless. I should have used an abstract class instead of interface.

I had totaly forgotten about this issue, sorry for the inconvenience.
