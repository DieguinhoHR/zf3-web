### Description

Because of the "ArrayObject returns value rather than reference" issue (see, for example, <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=51622> ), the Zend\\Session\\Container does not allow certain types of modifications of properties/array elements.

Here are some unit tests and responses that demonstrate the issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testContainerAllowsArrayModification()
        {
            $this->container['foo'] = 1;
            $this->assertEquals(1, $this->container['foo']);
            $this->container['foo']++;
            $this->assertEquals(2, $this->container['foo']);
        }


There was 1 error:

1) ZendTest\\Session\\ContainerTest::testContainerAllowsArrayModification Indirect modification of overloaded element of Zend\\Session\\Container has no effect

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testContainerAllowsObjectModification()
        {
            $this->container->foo = 1;
            $this->assertEquals(1, $this->container->foo);
            $this->container->foo++;
            $this->assertEquals(2, $this->container->foo);
        }


There was 1 failure:

1) ZendTest\\Session\\ContainerTest::testContainerAllowsObjectModification Failed asserting that 1 matches expected 2.

Interestingly, you can do the following fine:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $container += 1;


Considering that internally we're using an ArrayObject, the liklihood of getting this to work with increment and decrement operators is pretty slim. However, since increment/decrement on assignment works fine, I'd argue we should simply document those use cases.

Updating issue type to "documentation task".

Increment/decrement was just the simplest use case I could think of that caused a problem. Possibly more serious is the problem of appending to existing arrays:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testContainerAllowsArrayModificationOfArrays()
        {
            $this->container['foo'] = array();
            $this->assertEquals(0, count($this->container['foo']));
            $this->container['foo'][] = 'bar';
            $this->assertEquals(1, count($this->container['foo']));
        }
    
        public function testContainerAllowsObjectModificationOfArrays()
        {
            $this->container->foo = array();
            $this->assertEquals(0, count($this->container->foo));
            $this->container->foo[] = 'bar';
            $this->assertEquals(1, count($this->container->foo));
        }


(These trigger errors equivalent to the ones listed in the ticket above).

I agree that ```. (You can't use += in this context -- it yields an "Unsupported operand types" fatal error).

Right, but, again, because it's an ArrayObject implementation internally, you _can_ do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $container->foo->append('bar');


As such, I still feel this falls into a documentation issue -- we need to clarify that the container and its members follows ArrayObject behavior, which means you have to treat it as such when using it.

Makes sense -- thanks for the clarification. (I'm still not totally comfortable with ArrayObject behavior, but that's not ZF's problem!).
