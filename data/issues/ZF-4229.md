### Description

When repopulating data on a form through $form->populate($formData), the function adds slashes to user input and shows the slashes on the form.

Ex : -> I have a Zend\_Form with 2 elements a Text element and a submit element -> I have one validation rule on the Text element requireing 2 characters minimum -> I enter " on my form and click submit -> the form returns \\" and an error (please insert 2 characters mini)

Solution : Before repopulating data on the form the function populate should strip the slashes that were added to protect from user input.

This is not a framework issue. Please disable magic quotes in your php.ini or via an .htaccess directive. Magic quotes have been disabled by default throughout the PHP 5 branch and will be removed entirely by 6.0.0.

If disabling magic quotes is not an option (for example, when PHP is run as a CGI), you can create a filter to add to your form elements.
