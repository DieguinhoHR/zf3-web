### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryHit should implement fieldExists functionality, since the \_\_get throws and exception if the key ain't found. It is possible to hit different Document types and as such should be possible to present different fields.

I propose using \_\_isset() as in the attached diff.
