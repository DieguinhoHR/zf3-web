ZF-8453: Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberTextBox doesn't allow more than one constraint

### Description

It's not possible to use setPattern then subsequently setConstraint on a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberTextBox.

setPattern uses set constraint to add a pattern as a constraint then setConstraint overwrites the previous setPattern(setConstraint).

Actually, this is not related to specifically to Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberTextBox but to Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_ValidationTextBox

To describe more closely the issue, a few examples:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement(
        'NumberTextBox',
        'number',
        array(
            'label' => 'Number',
            'constraints' => array(
                'places' => '6'
            ),
            'pattern' => '0.######',
            'locale' => 'en'
        )
    );


Will generate the the constraints, as expected, for "places", "pattern" and "locale".

But, on the other hand:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement(
        'NumberTextBox',
        'number',
        array(
            'label' => 'Number',
            'pattern' => '0.######',
            'locale' => 'en',
            'constraints' => array(
                'places' => '6'
            )
        )
    );


will generate constraints only for the "places".

Even if the method name is setConstraints, what it is actually doing is adding constraints, so the second example should generate the same result as the first one.
