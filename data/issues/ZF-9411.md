### Description

I recently started writing a brand new app in PHP 5.3.0 and registered my own 'namespace'. When I reference a 'Zend\_' namespaced class from within my PHP namespace the Loader does not resolve it properly unless used like that \\Zend\_Cache::METHOD.

I have resolved the issue by extending the Zend\_Loader's method and applying the fix to the loadClass method.

This is due to the way PHP resolves class names in namespaces, I will point you to [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.basics.php) if you look in the example the manual shows

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foo::staticmethod(); // resolves to class Foo\Bar\foo, method staticmethod


I'm sure there's a better section but it's late and I did not find it.

Marking as Resolved - Not an issue.

As a second note - if you refer to the Zend\_ classes in your namespaced classes as \\Zend\_ Zend\_Loader will function as desired.
