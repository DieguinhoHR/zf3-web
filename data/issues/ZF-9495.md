ZF-9495: IMAP countMessages() speed increase
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-03-21T06:21:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:35.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap::countMessages() does a SEARCH each time it is asked for the total mail count (i.e when $flags is null.

That is an extremely inefficient way of doing this, especially for a large mailbox.

The IMAP protocol requires the response of EXISTS on SELECT or EXAMINE commands, which is the exact mail count at that point in time.

Could this be done instead?

I have a patch which already implements this from the $this->\_protocl->examine() return, which I will attach to the issue.

As a side note, the ideal way of doing this would be to listen to the return EXISTS and EXPUNGE messages from the protocol to update a local mail count variable, rather than making a call, but requires an additional patch to Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap to be able to attach a listener.

I will try doing this also, as I need the listener so I can also add IDLE support, which I also want to submit back to ZF.

Sorry, I found that examining a selected folder causes problems for deleting messages, so I've switched to protocol->select() to get the mail count.
