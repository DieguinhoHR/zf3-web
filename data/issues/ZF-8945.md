### Description

I trying to migrate from 1.8.4 to 1.9.7, but the ldap adapter is not working. I tried with multiple versions, version 1.9.2 -1.9.7 failed. Only version 1.9.1 worked.

I get invalid credentials error. After debuging I get this exception Zend\_Ldap\_Exception: 0xa (Referral; 0000202B: RefErr: DSID-0310063C, data 0, 1 access points ref 1: 'XXXXX.net' ): No object found for: (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=USERNAME)) in C:\\Files\\Apps\\PHP\\ZendFramework-1.9.2\\library\\Zend\\Ldap.php on line 653 It seems that bug was introduced in version 1.9.2.

Here is my configuration ldap.server1.host = XXXXXX.na.XXXXX.net ldap.server1.useSsl = false ldap.server1.accountDomainName = na.XXXXX.net ldap.server1.accountDomainNameShort = DDDDD ldap.server1.accountCanonicalForm = 4 ldap.server1.baseDn = "CN=na,DC=XXXXX,DC=net"

The following used to work

Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap'); $config = Zend\_Registry::get('config'); $ldap\_options = $config->ldap->toArray();  
 $ldap\_adapter = new Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap($ldap\_options, $username, $password);

// attempt to authenticate $auth = Zend\_Auth::getInstance(); $ldap\_result = $auth->authenticate($ldap\_adapter); if ( $ldap\_result->isValid() ) { echo "In"; } else { echo "Out"; }

I think it is not related to this bug because version change 1.9.1 din't help me. Also I have a different messaga "getting first entry" I don't have any idea of that and google seems to be empty too...

You're right, it may be possible that this problem was introduced with 1.9.2 when we added group membership features.

After I cleanup this piece of code it might be possible that this issue is also resolved with r21008 in trunk and r21009 in 1.10-release branch.

Perhaps you can give it a try.

Altogether it's quite hard to debug such issues without having access to the exact same environment.

I have the same problem. Using version 1.9.2 the Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap login worked fine. I did not change my code but with version 1.9.7 or 1.10.1 the Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap login does not work anymore and I don't know why. So I have to downgrade my application to version 1.9.2 what gets me into other trouble... :-( Any ideas?

Hi Timo,

same thing. Most likely this issue has been fixed with r21008 in trunk and r21009 in 1.10-release branch. But the commit to the release-branch was too late to make it into 1.10.1. You therefore must wait for 1.10.2 or use a direct checkout from the trunk or the 1.10-release-branch.

Best regards

Stefan

ok, I fixed my problem by adding the fields username and password to my ldap server options array. I did not use those values before. Now this is necessary because of the empty bind $ldap->bind(); in Auth\\Adapter\\Ldap.php on Line 323 (V 1.10.1). For username and password I use the same values which the user entered for login. this works for me.

Nice work-around... Your observation is cortrect. As I mentioned above, this whole thing should be fixed with 1.10.2

Hi Stefan, Thanks for your feedback. So I will be waiting for 1.10.2 ;-)

I upgraded from 1.9.4 to 1.10.1, LDAP auth stopped working. I applied version from trunk but it doesn't help. I run it through a debugger and it returns some error code = 49 and this "0x31 (Invalid credentials; 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 525, vece)" It works fine when I go back to 1.9.4

@Karol: Please provide some more information, especially about the configuration directives and which trunk version (revision) you used.

Thanks in advance! Best regards

Stefan
