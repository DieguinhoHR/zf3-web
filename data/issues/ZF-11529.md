ZF-11529: AMF server should register ACLs from auth adapter, if present
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, Zend\_Amf\_Adobe\_Auth will load ACLs from a given file. In order to use those ACLs with the server, you must do the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth = new Zend_Amf_Adobe_Auth($xmlAclFile);
    $server->setAuth($auth)
           ->setAcl($auth->getAcl());


Ideally, calling setAuth() with an object that implements a getAcl() method should auto-invoke setAcl() with the return value of getAcl().
