### Description

Consider the following code

 <?php class Test { public function argSimReturn(array $arg1, array $arg2, $arg3) { return $arg1; } } ?> Generated XML looks like below

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

But arguments arg1 and arg2 can be returned as

Because they are explicitly declared as array in the method signature.

When can I get this fix. Does the latest available download have it ? (it says 1.11.0 though)

It's in current svn, both in the trunk and 1.11 release branch. It will release with _1.11.1_ -- which will release next week.
