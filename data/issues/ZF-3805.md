### Description

When adding second validator of the same type wrong message is displayed:

Exception caught: Validator instance already exists for validator "Array"

(Array instead of Zend\_Validate\_SomeValidator)

This can be easily fixed in line 1959 of Zend/Form/Element.php by substituting $validator to $name.

This is already resolved in current trunk and the 1.6 release branch.
