### Description

While generating a RSS feed, i find that it included a www.example.com/atom">.

This seems to happen because i'm adding a self-link since the code base between RSS and Atom are shared, just the "format parameter" is altered.

Expected behaviour:

Writer should ignore this setting since its not an atom feed.
