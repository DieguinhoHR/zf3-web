### Description

The Zend\_Ldap class should throw an Zend\_Ldap\_Extension when ldap is disabled. Since all the ldap functions have there errors suppressed, when ldap is disabled the user has no idea why the frame work is no longer loading.

A quick fix can be found here for Zend\_Ldap is below :

 
    public function __construct($options = array())
    {
        if (function_exists('ldap_connect') === false)
        {
            require_once 'Zend/Ldap/Exception.php';         
            throw new Zend_Ldap_Exception(null, "LDAP Not installed", Zend_Ldap_Exception::LDAP_X_EXTENSION_NOT_LOADED);
        }
        $this->setOptions($options);
    }

There actually is such a check in the Zend\_Ldap constructor:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!extension_loaded('ldap')) {
       /**
        * @see Zend_Ldap_Exception
        */
        require_once 'Zend/Ldap/Exception.php';
        throw new Zend_Ldap_Exception(null, 'LDAP extension not loaded',
             Zend_Ldap_Exception::LDAP_X_EXTENSION_NOT_LOADED);
    }

I actually needed to add that to my framework code. I grabbed 1.9.6 from <http://www.zend.com/download/284> on 12-21-09 can you please check that the zip package is correct.

You're right - this check I mentioned above was introduced in r18924 and was not merged into the 1.9-release branch. This means this change will be in the 1.10-release.

Prior to that change there have checks for ext/ldap in Zend\_Ldap::connect() and Zend\_Ldap::disconnect(), so actually there should be checks in your version as well.

Alright sounds good. I'll Look forward to that release.
