### Description

Binding Operations allow to specifiy tags beneath the in both and . This is currently not supported by Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl.

For this to work properly Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl should be refactored big time, its currently implemented quite slobbish and hardcoded in its XML building.

As a hack, though this is probably not desired, one could extend the addBindingOperation() function to take another parameter $soapHeaders with 'input', 'output' keys in the first level and key->params that map to attribute name and value in the second level.

Is this ever going to be supported? Maybe in ZF 2.0? Is there a workaround? I am desperately need a solution for this.

Thanks!
