### Description

The code snippet presented in 7.5.5 contains a syntax error. The code is currently as follows:

---- CODE STARTS HERE ---- <?php $request->setBaseUrl(/~user/application-root/); ---- CODE ENDS HERE ----

It is missing the quotes surrounding the parameter, and should read:

---- CODE STARTS HERE ---- <?php $request->setBaseUrl('/~user/application-root/'); ---- CODE ENDS HERE ----

Of course, you could opt to use double quotes instead of single as well... whatever rocks your boat.
