### Description

If you try to retrieve an SSL stream through a "Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy" object without the proxy set, it will spawn notices about using undefined sslcert and sslpassphrases.

The reason is that I created an object extended from "Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy" which switches between proxy or not proxy as redirects might happen through or not through them (internal/external IP's).

Grtz, Steven
