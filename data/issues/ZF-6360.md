### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Core currently does not implement the getMetadatas() method from the Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_ExtendedInterface. This method should exist and deal with cache\_id\_prefix option. Otherwise this functionality can not be used without workarounds.

Unfortunately the call to the \_id() method for adding cache\_id\_prefixes if appropriate is still missing: $id = $this->\_id($id); // cache id may need prefix
