Apologies, must have been some thing strange going on with the docs, it has re-appeared already!

We've made no site changes -- I suspect you may have simply overlooked it.

I defiantly didn't overlook it... I double checked before opening the issue. I guess an ISP Proxy or similar may be holding and old copy.

That would explain it, too -- since these are static files, unless there is a change in size, many proxies will hold the cached version.
