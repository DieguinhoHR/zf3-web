ZF-3784: Include ./TestConfiguration.php from TestHelper.php
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

At the moment TestConfiguration.php is included from the $zfIncTests path which is hardcoded in TestHelper.php

There should be a way to include the TestConfiguration.php file from the same directory as the TestHelper.php file so one can override all the default include paths.

Matthew, can you look in to this and apply the patch if you're in agreement with Christoph?

TestHelper.php has undergone significant change. Also, unsure this use case is applicable with current PHPUnit.
