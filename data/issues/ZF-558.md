### Description

Thanks to Chris Shiflett for bringing this to light, which we should add (perhaps some variant thereof) to the documentation.

    Has anyone managed to rewrite this rule for lighttpd?
    
    Lighttpd uses the PCRE engine.
    
    RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$ index.php
    
    Syntax looks like this:
    
    url.rewrite-once = ( "<regex>" => "<relative-uri>" )

Resoving this issue, rewrite rules for both IIS (using Isapi\_Rewrite) and Lighttpd have been added to the incubator documentation - see r1644 on Zend\_Framework-ProvidedSubclasses.xml
