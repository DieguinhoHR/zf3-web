### Description

If the value of a feature is (Boolean)false the hasFeature-Function returns false.

Currently looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function hasFeature($feature)
    {
        return (!empty($this->_aFeatures[$feature]));
    }


I would recommend using "is\_null" instead of "empty":

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function hasFeature($feature)
    {
        return(!is_null($this->_aFeatures[$feature]));
    }

Will a test for is\_null() result in a warning if $this->\_aFeatures[$feature] doesn't exist?

Litte testing resultet in the expected warnings. The condition should contain a test for isset() to fix this. The code could look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function hasFeature($feature)
    {
        return(isset($this->_aFeatures[$feature]) && !is_null($this->_aFeatures[$feature]));
    }


Thx to lazy evaluation the is\_null expression wont be touched if the array key doesnt exist.
