ZF-10951: when "zf create module <module-name>" is supplied a module name in all small letters, it does not capitalize the first letter

### Description

zf create controller creates a controller with first letter capitalized no matter whether we supply a mixed-case name or not.

The same does not happen in zf create module .

This is a problem because if someone made a module like zf create module admin, it creates the module with the name admin (in the xml profile)

and then when someone tries to create a model, zf create model test -m admin, it creates a model with class name admin\_Model\_Test and not Admin\_Model\_Test

Patch file for the said bug.

In Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Module's create() function, we just get the supplied module name and make it ucfirst.

@Amit

You could really confirm that you this using ZF-1.11.2 with _zf show version_ because believe that this issue was fixed with ZF-1.11.1 in r23417 issues related ZF-9695 and ZF-10237.

@Ramon

I tried it with ZF 1.11.2 at work so many times, it did not work thats why raised bug :(

But now at home i downloaded latest version and tried and it works just fine ! It seems fine in 1.11.2 !! My bad .. I must have clearly missed something ... I tried searching and the search did not lead me to your fix also...

Apologies and Peace :D
