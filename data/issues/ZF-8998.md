ZF-8998: Zend\_Locale::setDefault() fails to set default properly
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-28T08:54:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-28T14:30:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.1 (10/Feb/10)

### Description

When Zend\_Locale::setDefault() is called, it internally calls self::\_prepareLocale() with the given $locale, which then sets the static self::$\_auto variable if it has not already been set. In setting self::$\_auto, \_prepareLocale() calls Zend\_Locale::getDefault(), which returns the value of the PREVIOUS default (the one before setDefault() was called). Since the self::$\_auto variable never changes once set, all subsequent calls to \_prepapreLocale() will cause the old default to be used should it fall back to "auto". Thus, calling Zend\_Locale::setDefault() has no effect on the default when "auto" is used.

Agreed and solved with r20731 also when this is a real rare case
