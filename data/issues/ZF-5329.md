------------------------------------

### Description

1) testStatementBindParamByName(Zend\_Db\_Statement\_MysqliTest) Failed asserting that two strings are equal. expected string difference < xxxxxxxxx????> got string

2) testStatementBindValueByName(Zend\_Db\_Statement\_MysqliTest) Failed asserting that two strings are equal. expected string difference < xxxxxxxxx????> got string

This is caused because mysqli not supporting named parameters so the code if ($this->\_adapter->supportsParameters('named') === false) is evalaluated to true and the Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception is thrown.

Corrected the expected string in the unit test as the funcationality looks correct
