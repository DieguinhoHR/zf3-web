### Description

The http Adapter configured with digest auth has a bug with Firefox. If you enter no username or a username with a ":" in or non printable chars the specific adapter returns false and its not possible to re \_challengeClient with the client until the browser was restartet. (IE works perfect)

A solution would be to set the username to 'unknown' or something else to keep the auth process running and allow re \_challengeClient calls or return a specific value back to the calling script as a return code in the Zend\_Auth\_Result for user handling. Tested with FF 1.5.0.10.

workaround:

File: Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http.php Line: 664 - return false; + $temp[1] = 'unknown';

Line: 667 - return false; + $temp[1] = 'unknown';

Apparently, it was seeing the invalid user name and immediately returning an HTTP 400 response. That's the "right thing" to do, but a bit too unforgiving. I've applied a fix similar to that mentioned above, and it seems to work for me in IE7, FF2, and O9. As with the rest of this adapter, I don't have a Mac at my disposal to test with Safari (but I would hope that it works there as well).

Resolved with SVN [r3957](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=3957).
