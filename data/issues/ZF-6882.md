After a brief discussion on IRC (#zftalk.dev @ freenode) we've decided not to include this functionality in ZF. If you want to use configuration stuff in your views though you are advised to either use an action plugin, controller plugin or view helper, because the way Zend\_View has been set up is to get everything from helpers, plugins, etc, which would make a configuration target "tricky".
