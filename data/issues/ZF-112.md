### Description

Using ZendFramework-0.1.3 and trying the sample code for Service Yahoo:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Service/Yahoo.php';
    $yahoo = new Zend_Service_Yahoo("YAHOO_APPLICATION_ID");
    $results = $yahoo->webSearch('PHP');
    foreach ($results as $result) {
        echo $result->Title .'<br></br>';
    }
    ?>


I get the following error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function setHost() on a non-object in library/Zend/Service/Yahoo.php on line 299

If, in said file, I change that line from,

$this->\_uri->setHost('api.search.yahoo.com');

To,

$this->\_rest->setUri('<http://api.search.yahoo.com>');

Then I see successful completion

btw, I'm running MAMP on a G4 powerbook, though I get the same error running Linux.

Also, turning on warnings I get the following warning:

Notice: Undefined property: Zend\_Service\_Yahoo::$\_uri in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/ZendFramework-0.1.3/library/Zend/Service/Yahoo.php on line 299

All the Yahoo! searches currently have fatal errors - looks like they got left behind in revision 197.

This patch updates localSearch, newsSearch, and webSearch to use Zend\_Service\_Rest instead of Zend\_Uri\_Http and also fixes the host given in imageSearch.

Just a tidier version of the previous patch really.
