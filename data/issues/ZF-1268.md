### Description

Currently the default case mapping is CASE\_NATURAL in the PDO database adapters. So the column names that appear as array indexes in a result set from a query match the spelling (including case) returned by the RDBMS.

In the describeTable() method, there is a hard-coded assumption that the CASE\_NATURAL attribute is in effect, so the columns are references as $row['Field'], $row['Type'], etc.

However, a user can set the PDO connection attributes for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($database->type, $dbInfo);
    $db->getConnection()->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_CASE, PDO::CASE_LOWER);


Then the result sets are returned with column-names in lower-case. This makes the array indexes referenced in describeTable() incorrect.

Please enhance describeTable() in such a way that it works regardless of the current PDO CASE attribute setting.

Also the key in the array returned by describeTable(), which is keyed by the column name of the table being described, should be transformed according to the current PDO CASE attribute.

Change summary. This applies to all PDO adapters, not just MySQL.

The fix is applied in revision 4576.

There is no case-folding applied to the column name in the key of the array returned by describeTable(). The reason for this is that the case is significant, because column names are commonly delimited in SQL generated from Zend\_Db classes.
