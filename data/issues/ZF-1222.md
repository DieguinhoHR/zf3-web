### Description

I was writing a unit test for my application using Zend\_Http\_Client->setParameterPost(). When launching the test I get a PHP warning:

Warning: http\_build\_query() expects at most 2 parameters, 3 given in {path\_to\_my\_app}\\include\\zf\\library\\Zend\\Http\\Client.php on line 935

In fact, looking at that line there is: $body = http\_build\_query($this->paramsPost, '', '&');

Thanks

I'm sorry, I didn't see my php version was 5.1.1, after upgrading to a newer version the problem disappeared as the third parameter was added in 5.1.2. This issue may be considered closed.

Yep... from [http://php.net/http\_build\_query](http://php.net/http_build_query) :

    Version  Description
    5.1.2    The arg_separator parameter was added.
    5.1.3    Square brackets are escaped. 


So I guess this bug can be closed.
