ZF2-335: DI not resolving parameters for child classes properly
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-05-31T22:46:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:14.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Given the following classes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class A
    {
        public $test;
     
        public function setTest($test)
        {
            $this->test = $test;
            return $this;
        }
    }
    
    class B extends A
    {
    }


If you configure DI to inject class A's 'test parameter with the string 'a' and class B's 'test' parameter with the string 'b', and you do $b = $di->get('B'); you will get an instance of B with the test parameter set to the string 'a', which is clearly not the expected result.

I have wrote a failing test to illustrate the issue: [https://github.com/EvanDotPro/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/EvanDotPro/zf2/compare/hotfix/di-parent-parameters)

This test actually used to pass at one point, and some change broke this behavior. If I can figure out when that happened, I'll update this issue.
