ZF-10817: infinite recursion in EmailAddress validator

### Description

Hello.

I just noticed something looking as in infinite recursion in EmailAddress class, when installing TikiWiki on linux.

method isValid() calls method \_validateHostnamePart() (line 544) method \_validateHostnamePart() calls method isValue() (line 487), with a syntax looking list a cut'n'paste error: $hostname = $this->\_options['hostname']->setTranslator($this->getTranslator()) ->isValid($this->\_hostname);

Even with a 512M memory limit in php, this result in php processing stopping right after this line, without any error displayed either in the output or in apache log files. Just removing the second line is enough to fix the issue.

I don't know the exact version of Zend framework shipped with tikiwiki sux (bundling dependencies in application is bad practice IMHO), but I checked current version in Zend subversion repository, the code is the same.

BTW, I'm not a php developper, so my analysis may be plainly wrong.

Closing as non-issue.

Even a non-php programmer would have seen that \_validateHostnamePart calls a method from another object and not from the same object.

There is no recursion within the EmailAdress validator.
