### Description

Hi,

Sometime is usefull to get the list of all the caches handled by cache manager.

However, even if the cache manager has a protected

protected $\_caches = array();

it doesn't offer any way to return back all the caches (or caches names).

This could be useful in certain situations, i would only mention the need to cleanup all the caches...

Btw, i'we mtioned cleaning all the caches as a trivial task. I think would worth adding such method as well.

-> added method Zend\_Cache\_Manager::getCaches() returning an array contains all available caches with it's names

waiting for padaric to reviewing changes related to adding this method (removing option template "skeleton" & using default options of file backend by default)
