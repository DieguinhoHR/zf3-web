### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector::setGoto

rewrite the array $params in a sequence of /param/value

but when you provide an array in value, it's not converted in multiple params, like this ?param[]=value1&param[]=value2 but in param/array

And in th same way, provide a solution for rewriting parameters including "/". In example a date 23/11/1982 become param/23/11/1982 , and 11 its become the name of the second parameter and 1982 the value.

we also provided the same solution ?param=23/11/1982

almost, we can use a option for choosing type of rewrite parameters

I will definitely try and address the array issue for 1.1.0. However, the last example you gave is simply not an option when using the URL PATH for passing parameters; there's no way to determine what's a PATH segment and what's a date. Use dashes instead.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This will not be possible unless the router can support array values in the URL.

Matthew, it looks like the issue this one is dependent on is assigned to Martel. Can you check if this is feasible for 1.6 given the dependency? If not, let's postpone it and reopen it when we feel it needs to be addressed. Also, if this requires a proposal, we should make it clear here and postpone it to be reopened when the proposal is accepted.
