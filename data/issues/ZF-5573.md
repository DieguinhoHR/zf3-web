### Description

Expect 100 support in Zend\_Http\_Client would be helpful for my Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 class to avoid sending the data to Amazon's S3 service unless it is allowed.

See [http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3)

Closed with inclusion of ZF-3616, cURL Adapter, which supports 100-continue.
