### Description

Add programmatically actionscript code like this <a href="">www.fpdf.de/downloads/addons/36/</a>" rel="nofollow">FPDF addon .

There are two function (setJavascript and getJavascript) in Zend/Pdf.php but these are not used in the whole ZF (1.5.1)

Has there been any work done on this at all, ive searched and searched for days and only manged to come across this code snip from a few years ago:

[http://osdir.com/ml/php.zend.framework.formats/â€¦](http://osdir.com/ml/php.zend.framework.formats/2007-03/msg00010.html)

[add this to the zend/pdf.php class]

public function setEmbeddedJS($javascript) { /\*\* \* Names container \*/ if ( null === $javascript || '' === $javascript) { throw new Zend\_Pdf\_Exception( "Javascript must be set." ); } $this->setJavaScript($javascript); $js\_code = array( "S" => new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Name('JavaScript'), "JS" => new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_String($this->getJavascript()) ); $embed[] = new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_String('EmbeddedJS'); $embed[] = $this->\_objFactory->newObject(new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Dictionary($js\_code)); $js\_ref = $this->\_objFactory->newObject(new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Dictionary(array('Names' => new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Array($embed)))); $this->\_trailer->Root->Names = new Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Dictionary(array('JavaScript' => $js\_ref)); }

whilst this works for new pdfs generated by the user entirely, it doesn't inject script into pdfs that have been opened edited and amended which is giving me a load of ball ache, has anyone got any ideas how i could use it to inject JS into an exsiting PDF??
