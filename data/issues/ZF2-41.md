### Description

Empty static route (empty string) will NEVER match (sample from docs, Route\_Hostname, Route\_Static).

This has already been fixed in 1.11 in oct 2010.

I'm reporting this and sending a patch for ZF2. Please pull.

Fixed by pull request 255 and approved by Matthew. Suggest closing issues once pull requests sent and re-opening if the request is declined (something for zf-contributors to determine going forward).
