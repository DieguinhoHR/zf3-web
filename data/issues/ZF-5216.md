### Description

this may be the same as bug ZF-2461, but come back for the 1.7.1 release...

i have inherited another developer's code, and i am not familiar with zend, however googling for "uncaught exception zend" took me to the bug mentioned above.

please let me know what other information you need.

cheers,

russell

recently I was ungently need a workaround for this issue and herebelow is what i've found

is exception has been thrown in plugin we should 1) discontinue to render/dispatch actions/layouts

a/ patch for a standart dispatcher to make sure we do not render dispatched action, but render everything what came form error controller and actions called from its layout

Index: Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php
=========================================

--- Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php () +++ Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php (working copy) @@ -231,7 +231,12 @@ public function dispatch(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract $request, Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract $response) {

 $this->setResponse($response);
-------------------------------

- $params = $request->getParams();
- $arr = array('module', 'controller', 'action');
- if ($response->isException() && !array\_key\_exists('error\_handler', $params) && array\_intersect($arr, array\_keys($params)) == $arr) {
- $request->setDispatched(true);
- return;
- } /\*\* \* Get controller class \*/

b/ fix a plugin broker Controller/Plugin/Broker.php

no need to extend this class with an abstract one, just add some protected variables

class Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Broker { /\*\* \* @var Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract \*/ protected $\_request;

 
     /**
     * @var Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract
     */
    protected $_response;
    
    /**
     * Array of instance of objects extending Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract
     *
     * @var array
     */
     protected $_plugins = array();
    
     /**
     * Array of plugin's methods where an exception was thrown to avoid in next call
     * Array keys are methods for magic call
     *
     * I think that these keys would rather be obtained using reflection of abstract class
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $skipPlugins = array(
                                    'routeStartup' => array(),
                                    'routeShutdown' => array(),
                                    'dispatchLoopStartup' => array(),
                                    'preDispatch' => array(),
                                    'postDispatch' => array(),
                                    'dispatchLoopShutdown' => array()
                                );


then remove all these functions as they copy each other, eg their behavior is similar to each other and add a magic method to call them instead

 
    private function __call($method, $args)
    {
        if (array_key_exists($method, $this->skipPlugins)) { // check is the proper method is called
            foreach ($this->_plugins as $plugin) {
                if (in_array($plugin, $this->skipPlugins[$method])) {
                    continue; // ie skip the plugin where exception has been thrown in
                }
                try {
                    if (count($args > 0)) {
                        $plugin->$method($args[0]);
                    } else {
                        $plugin->$method();
                    }
                } catch (Exception $e) {
                    if (Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->throwExceptions()) {
                        throw $e;
                    } else {
                        $this->getResponse()->setException($e);
                        $this->skipPlugins[$method][] = $plugin;
                    }
                 }
             }
        } else {
            require_once 'Zend/Controller/Action/Exception.php';
            throw new Exception('Method "' . $method . '" does not exist!');
         }
     }


a bit stupid but this does work at least

I tried to fully understand the code snippet and reproduce the issues, but I cannot.

if you can provide a valid use-case and demonstrative script, please re-open.

Thanks, Ralph
