### Description

Iam using the DB2 Adapter with the Pear DB2 driver.

The Problem is, that in all Select Statements the schema were not added.

An Example. Iam Using the find() Method.

These are my attributes: protected $\_schema = 'USERS'; protected $\_name = 'USERS'; protected $\_primary = 'USER\_ID';

But the find() Method Create this Where clause (("USERS"."USER\_ID" = 1))

A solution is to add an alias like "USERS.USERS as users". That works with the select cstmt class, but theres no chance to do that for the find() method, and it isnt best practice too.

It seems to be duplicate of ZF-6039
