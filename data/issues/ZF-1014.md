ZF-1014: Move route config loading mechanisms to route themselves
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I will modify config route loading - route instantiation and config parameter loading will be handled by routes themselves.

It will allow custom routes authors to craft Zend\_Config paramters more freely as each route type will have more control over the process of config variable parsing.

This is an issue pertaining to Zend\_Controller, right? I'll set the component field.

Right. As well as the other issue (which is already taken care of). Sorry, my fault :)
