### Description

I think it would be extermely useful to have the abbility to cache actions in the same way as Zend\_Cache\_Forntend\_Page. In init() i would setup cacheable actions, options and if cache found it would inject it directly to response....

I think now I can use Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Class, but it's just too complicated to handle all the stuff around - like response segments... Or Zend\_Cache\_Output, but it still doesn't do the job.

I don't understand.

Is it something to implement in Zend\_Cache or in Zend MVC stuff ?

Not sure where it would be the best place form implementation. My point is, that there is no easy way of chaching one specific Controller and/or some of his Actions. You can do it via URL or via caching the class, but no easy "one array config" solution.

I think of something like

Zend\_Cache::registerControllerCache($array); It would setup the cache, save it in Registry and then use it in the dispatching process to find whether the action needs to be regenerated or not. Am I clear?

I'll try to write the code I'd like to use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $frontendOptions = (array('index','index','default'),array('about','index','default'));
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Controller','File',$frontendOptions,$backendOptions);
    //save it to Registry to some specific key
    $frontController->dispatch();


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //get from registry (should be auto - like Zend_Translate)
    if($cache->isCachedRequest($request)){ 
    // check if already cached and send stored cache to response object
    } else {
    // continue normally
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($cache->isCachedRequest($request)){ 
    $cache->save($responseData);
    // including response segment, view renderer state, noRender, etc...
    }
    //send to response


Does this help? Is there any way to do this this easily with current Zend\_Cache components?

There is an action helper provided for this purpose: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Cache
