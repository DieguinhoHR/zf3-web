### Description

I'm encoding two times the utf-8 string 'Ã±', the encoder works, but the decoder fails to decode it (and the php funcion json\_decode works). The problem is that you applies decodeUnicodeString to all the input string, but the right way is to apply it to every json encoded string in the input.
