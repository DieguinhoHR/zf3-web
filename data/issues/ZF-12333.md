### Description

This is a dupe of ZF-6040 but I don't seem to be able to reopen that bug.

I'm seeing the same issue with the Windows Live Connect API (Server: Live-API/16.2.1431.613 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0). It seems that checking the first two bytes % 31 isn't sufficient.

For me adding a check for the compression method helps (which in RFC 1950 is defined as 8 for deflate, and no other methods are defined): if ($zlibHeader[1] % 31 == 0 && ord($body[0]) & 0x0f == 8) {

However I imagine this check could also be defeated by chance in the wild, maybe the code should check for known-bad servers in the Server header?

Here's the body which was causing the failure: "\\xEC\\xBD\\x07\\x60\\x1C\\x49\\x96\\x25\\x26\\x2F\\x6D\\xCA\\x7B\\x7F\\x4A\\xF5\\x4A\\xD7\\xE0\\x74\\xA1\\x08\\x80\\x60\\x13\\x24\\xD8\\x90\\x40\\x10\\xEC\\xC1\\x88\\xCD\\xE6\\x92\\xEC\\x1D\\x69\\x47\\x23\\x29\\xAB\\x2A\\x81\\xCA\\x65\\x56\\x65\\x5D\\x66\\x16\\x40\\xCC\\xED\\x9D\\xBC\\xF7\\xDE\\x7B\\xEF\\xBD\\xF7\\xDE\\x7B\\xEF\\xBD\\xF7\\xBA\\x3B\\x9D\\x4E\\x27\\xF7\\xDF\\xFF\\x3F\\x5C\\x66\\x64\\x01\\x6C\\xF6\\xCE\\x4A\\xDA\\xC9\\x9E\\x21\\x80\\xAA\\xC8\\x1F\\x3F\\x7E\\x7C\\x1F\\x3F\\x22\\x7E\\xF1\\x6F\\x9C\\xA6\\xE9\\x47\\x79\\x5D\\x57\\xF5\\x47\\x8F\\x52\\xFE\\x0B\\x1F\\x4C\\xAB\\x59\\x4E\\x7F\\x7F\\x54\\xE7\\xBF\\x68\\x9D\\x37\\xED\\xEF\\xDF\\x56\\x6F\\xF3\\xE5\\xEF\\x9F\\xBF\\x5B\\x15\\x75\\x3E\\xFB\\x68\\x94\\x9A\\x76\\x8B\\xBC\\x69\\xB2\\x0B\\x6E\\xFA\\x66\\x9E\\xA7\\xAB\\xBA\\xBA\\x2C\\x66\\xF9\\x2C\\xCD\\xA6\\x53\\xFA\\x26\\xE5\\xD7\\xD2\\x79\\xD6\\xA4\\xFA\\xEA\\xF8\\x23\\xBC\\xF9\\x4B\\x7E\\xE3\\x5F\\xF2\\xFF\\x04\\x00\\x00\\xFF\\xFF"
