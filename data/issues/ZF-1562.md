### Description

having a table like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE `brands` (
      `brand_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
      `description` text NOT NULL,
      `visible` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY  (`brand_id`)
    )


and running

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    print_r($db->describeTable('brands'));


looking for the info about the "visible" field, we see

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [brand_id] => Array
            (
                [SCHEMA_NAME] => 
                [TABLE_NAME] => brands
                [COLUMN_NAME] => brand_id
                [COLUMN_POSITION] => 1
                [DATA_TYPE] => int
                [DEFAULT] => 
                [NULLABLE] => 
                [LENGTH] => 
                [SCALE] => 
                [PRECISION] => 
                [UNSIGNED] => 
                [PRIMARY] => 1
                [PRIMARY_POSITION] => 1
                [IDENTITY] => 
            )
    
        [description] => Array
            (
                [SCHEMA_NAME] => 
                [TABLE_NAME] => brands
                [COLUMN_NAME] => description
                [COLUMN_POSITION] => 2
                [DATA_TYPE] => text
                [DEFAULT] => 
                [NULLABLE] => 
                [LENGTH] => 
                [SCALE] => 
                [PRECISION] => 
                [UNSIGNED] => 
                [PRIMARY] => 
                [PRIMARY_POSITION] => 
                [IDENTITY] => 
            )
    
        [visible] => Array
            (
                [SCHEMA_NAME] => 
                [TABLE_NAME] => brands
                [COLUMN_NAME] => visible
                [COLUMN_POSITION] => 3
                [DATA_TYPE] => tinyint(1)
                [DEFAULT] => 
                [NULLABLE] => 
                [LENGTH] => 
                [SCALE] => 
                [PRECISION] => 
                [UNSIGNED] => 
                [PRIMARY] => 
                [PRIMARY_POSITION] => 
                [IDENTITY] => 
            )
    
    )


for both brand\_id and visible length is empty, for visible field there's also an error in the data\_type attrib cause the (1) part should be removed

Edit JIRA format tag (code:php) to simply (code). There is no php-specific code formatter in this application.
