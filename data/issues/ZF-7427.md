### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle->describeTable() function will not perform on large databases.

The reason is that this function queries some large, key tables such as ALL\_TAB\_COLUMNS, ALL\_CONSTRAINTS, but the joins/filters are written in a way which they will tablescan the database rather than use any indexes efficiently.

On smaller databases this would not even be noticeable. But we have large oracle databases at work, with many objects in them, and so these queries are table-scanning and will not finish executing for us.

With some simple changes I was able to fix these performance issues. This is my re-written function:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function describeTable($tableName, $schemaName = null)
        {
            $version = $this->getServerVersion();
            if (($version === null) || version_compare($version, '9.0.0', '>=')) {
                $sql = "    SELECT  TC.TABLE_NAME,
                                    TC.OWNER,
                                    TC.COLUMN_NAME,
                                    TC.DATA_TYPE,
                                    TC.DATA_DEFAULT,
                                    TC.NULLABLE,

                );
            }
            return $desc;
        }


Basically the key is to use the OWNER column in the joins. Without this, there are way too many rows to scan through for the database. The original code was attempting to do this, but in a way that was still causing table-scans to occur.

For instance, the original code had this in the where clause:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($schemaName) { 
        $sql .= ' AND UPPER(TC.OWNER) = UPPER(:SCNAME)';


You can't put UPPER() around TC.OWNER, because as soon as you do that, Oracle will not use any indexes that are attached to that column. (unless there was a function based index there, but there isn't). It happens to be unnecessary to use UPPER() anyway, since the column is in uppercase anyhow.

It seems to be duplicated by ZF-10415.

Thank you, Adam! My describeTable() performance went from 0.3s/query to 0.1s/query with this optimization.
