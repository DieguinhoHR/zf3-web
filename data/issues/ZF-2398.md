ZF-2398: Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadLink should be Doctype-aware

### Description

The Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadLink component uses shorthand tag closing notation on all link elements, regardless of the DOCTYPE provided to the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Doctype component. I.e., it always produces elements like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Instead of the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


The current behavior is fine for documents written as XHTML, but not necessarily for HTML without the X; running such a document through the W3 validator (as, say, HTML 4.01 Strict) produces warnings and errors.

This is a fairly trivial problem (since most browsers have no problem handling this kind of shorthand even in older flavors of HTML), but I think it would also be fairly trivial to fix (in fact, there's a good, simple precedent in lines 374-380 of the HeadScript helper), and doing so would make the framework's output more compliant with W3 standards (if only a little).

This seems to be the source of a few inconsistencies

Neither Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta or Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadStyle make any allowances for different doctypes either, however both default to using non-XHTML mark-up.

Other Zend\_View\_Helper\_\* seem to default to XHTML, as in this case, although I've only checked a few.

As we have a doctype check with isXhtml() it seems sensible to use it across the board and to have a consistent default. At the moment tag soup is inevitable due to the existing defaults and the fact that only one Helper seems to allow changes.

Scheduling for 1.5.0, and upgrading priority slightly.

All head_() helpers and (hopefully) all form_() helpers are now doctype aware.
