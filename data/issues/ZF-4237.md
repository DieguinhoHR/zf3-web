### Description

I also have an issue with the label decorator. I couldn't find a way to add this to [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2992>], so that's why this is a new issue, sorry.

But as the reporter says, it doesn't work as the documents tells us. I also think that the added class should be in the block level tag instead of the label tag itself. Maybe it should even be in both tags! Maybe it can be done in a way that when there is a htmlwrapper, tha class goes in the block level tag, otherwise in the label tag itself.

The label decorator should work as the other decorators (and as expected).

The class is related semantically to the label, not the surrounding tag. If you want different behavior, you're free to create your own decorator.
