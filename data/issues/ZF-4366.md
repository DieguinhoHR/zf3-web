### Description

SoapServer->setObject($object) is an undocumeneted but very useful method of the SoapServer extension. Its missing in the Zend Soap Server wrapper. The attached patch contains a new method setObject on the Zend\_Soap\_Server object that registers one object and injects the object into the SoapServer in \_getSoap().

I have also added the patch to the ServerTest.php to add one unittest that checks functionality of setObject().

I have made some tests and found out that using both setClass and setObject does not work for SoapServer, but i haven't implemented an Exception yet that warns on usage of both of them. SoapServer just processes the first one of both calls and /dev/null's all the requests to the second. I havent throughly tested this though, so I cant give a final word on this (and left out the exception respectivly).

Added missing documentation part. This now shows how setObject is used inside the already existing setClass example.
