### Description

Zend Framework Proposals Page

It would be nice, if we could edit our comments we added to proposals after submitting them. So when something was forgotten, or mistyped we could correct our sent comments for xxx minutes.

I'll look into if this is possible, either via a setting or plugin.

Reassigning from Jayson to Bill Karwin, pending further triage.

No solution exists at this time for Confluence to allow users to edit their own comments. See <http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-830> for the feature request.

Removing fixed version, it is irrelevant for this resolution.

There's a plugin available (V0.5) which llows the author of the _Last Comment_ to edit his comment.
