### Description

I'm not really sure this behavior can be considered a bug, it might be an improvements or an additional feature. BTW, here's the issue.

Sometimes HTTP request returns a particular response header called "Refresh:". Consider this case

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    HTTP 200
    Date: Mon, 28 May 2007 20:50:24 GMT
    Server: Apache/1.3.37 (Unix) mod_auth_passthrough/1.8 mod_log_bytes/1.2 mod_bwlimited/1.4 PHP/4.4.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635.SR1.2 mod_ssl/2.8.28 OpenSSL/0.9.8a
    X-powered-by: PHP/4.4.4
    Refresh: 0; url=account-login.php?returnto=%2Ftorrents-details.php%3Fid%3D1797
    Connection: close


If you try to open this URL in a browser it will be immediatly redirected to url=account-login.php?returnto=%2Ftorrents-details.php%3Fid%3D1797 . Should Zend\_Http\_Client follow this responses a redirect?

The "Refresh" header is not standard AFAIK and I could not find it in any RFC. I understand many browsers support it, but I am not sure it should be implemented in the HTTP client but rather in a separate layer.

What do I mean? Browsers are more than HTTP clients - they also render and "execute" HTTP response content. That is, if an HTTP server tells the browser to "Refresh" a page in 5 seconds, it will - this is not something we should implement in an HTTP client. The fact that "Refresh: 0" behaves like redirection is interesting, but I don't think it's the correct way to redirect, plus I don't think we should implement a special case just for "Refresh: 0" responses.

You can always implement this functionality yourself, and quite easily also, by either wrapping or extending the HTTP client class.

If you still think this is a good idea, I suggest moving the discussion to fw-general@lists.zend.com so everyone can have their say.

Hi Shahar, I agree with you. This functionality might easily be implemented in a custom extension of HTTP Client.

I agree as well browsers are more than a simple HTTP Client. :)

Thanks for your answer, Simone
