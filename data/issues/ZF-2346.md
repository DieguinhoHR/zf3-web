### Description

In line 1790 there seems to be a strange unicode symbol instead of whitespace. (I assume there should be white space or a punctuation character.)

<> 1790 - 1790 +

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
