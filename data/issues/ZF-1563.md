ZF-1563: QuoteInto doesn't work with Sqlite
-------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-06-14T05:37:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-06-19T14:22:43.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.2 (15/May/08)

### Description

We discover a problem with quoteInto and SQLite.

The Zend Framework generate this kind of SQL (we use quoteInto for projects\_id and users\_id):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    DELETE FROM "usvn_users_to_projects" WHERE (projects_id = '1' AND users_id = 1)


But in SQlite quote seems to be mandatory and we need write:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    DELETE FROM "usvn_users_to_projects" WHERE (projects_id = '1' AND users_id = '1')


We made an ugly hack to fix the problem into Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Sqlite.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function quote($value)
    {
        if (is_int($value) || is_float($value)) {
           return parent::quote("$value");
        }
        return parent::quote($value);
    }

I'm not sure I understand. Are the SQL datatypes of projects\_id and users\_id integer or varchar?

Does SQLite have a problem comparing an integer literal to a varchar? Some RDBMS brands have the opposite problem, you can't compare a string literal to an integer column.

You also have a workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $expr = $db->quoteInto('users_id = ?', (string) 1);

This is not a critical bug, since there are already two workarounds.

I'd be glad to fix it regardless, but I'm reducing the severity.

Reopening. SQLite does require that integers are compared to integers, and strings are compared to strings.

Problem is still present. That's why we use this patch:

Unmark fixed version.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Hi Julian

I'm looking into this for the 1.6 release if it's able to be resolved. Can I clarify - what is the reason for explicitly casting as a string by default? The only concern I have defaulting to a string type is that it will break an existing expected behaviour. Or is SQLite expecting a string and this behaviour has always been incorrect.

The patch itself is straight-forward, as are the tests, but I want to be sure this is absolutely required before committing.

I just test and now it's work without our patch. Thanks for your help.
