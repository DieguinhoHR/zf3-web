### Description

"Zend\_Pagiinator\_Adapter\_DbSelect" function count() needs to also reset the ORDER clause because COLUMNS resets, therefor if you rename a column with AS, the ORDER BY clause will not see the column created with AS in the select statement.

I solved this problem by adding: reset(Zend\_Db\_Select::ORDER) after line 134.
