### Description

The Zend Soap Server is unable to work with the ?wsdl parameter, it provides the INVALID XML soap fault. This is required by software such as XMLSpy to read the wsdl and find the exposed functions. I believe this can be easily rectified by adding the following code to the handle function.

if(!null === $request) { try { $this->\_setRequest($request); } catch (Zend\_Soap\_Server\_Exception $setRequestException) { // Do nothing. Catch exception and store it in the $setRequestException variable is all what we need. } }

I have added this to my preview version and it is now working as I would expect.

Thanx Wayne

This is not a bug, you have to explicilty use the AutoDiscover class to listen at ?wsdl. Zend\_Soap\_Server does not do that for you like NuSoap does for example.

See <http://www.whitewashing.de/blog/articles/65> for an example.
