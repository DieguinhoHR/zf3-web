### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filters = array(
        '*' => 'stringTrim'
    );
    $validators = array(
        'image' => array(
            'allowEmpty' => FALSE,
            new Zend_Validate_File_ImageSize(array('minheight'=>80,'minwidth'=>709,'maxheight'=>80,'maxwidth'=>709)),
        )
    );
    $input = new Zend_Filter_Input($filters, $validators);
    $files['image'] = $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'];
    $input->setData($files);
    if (!$input->isValid()) {
        print_r($input->getMessages(););
    }


//print: //Minimum expected width for image '' should be '709' but '128' detected //Maximum allowed height for image '' should be '80' but '128' detected //I think it should be: //Minimum expected width for image 'image' should be '709' but '128' detected //Maximum allowed height for image 'image' should be '80' but '128' detected

The reason seem that you truncate the $\_FILES array. You should note that the internal uploaded name must not be used because of security reasons. You should also note that the user should not get the name of the form element as expected by you.
