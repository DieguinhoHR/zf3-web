I can not verify this...

Running on Windows, trunk, php 5.2.5, this test passes without problems and outputs no error (14 tests, 34 exceptions tested).

Problem still exists in my environment. Working on it.

The problem is caused by the fact that stdClass objects can't be converted to string, _and_ [ZF-4463] fix.
