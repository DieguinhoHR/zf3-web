### Description

When trying to assign readonly to a view helper such as formText it is translated into a type="hidden" automatically.

$this->formText('city', $this->directory->city, array('readonly' => 'readonly'))

becomes:

Wilmette

Looking further into this it appears that this was done intentionally. I can't find a Zend\_View or Zend\_View\_Helper proposal, so I'm not sure why the disable code exists. My guess would be that initially this fuctionallity was intended to be able disable a form as a whole, and then wasn't implimented fully or correctly. Each of the individual form helpers is coded to check $disable and take action.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function formText($name, $value = null, $attribs = null)
        {
            $info = $this->_getInfo($name, $value, $attribs);
            extract($info); // name, value, attribs, options, listsep, disable
            
            // build the element
            if ($disable) {
                // disabled
                $xhtml = $this->_hidden($name, $value)
                       . htmlspecialchars($value, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8');
            } else {
                // enabled
                $xhtml = '_htmlAttribs($attribs)
                       . ' />';
            }
            
            return $xhtml;
        }


Maybe the feeling was that this was a more universally excepted by browsers, I clearly don't know. But it is preventing me from getting the desired behavior and appears to be a bug.

Behaviour fixed in r4320. 'readonly' attrib now correctly set to 'readonly', and the element is no longer disabled.

This is minor. There is a comment in the code in FormElement.php that no longer applies.

- Note that you cannot pass a 'disable' param'; you need to pass
- it as an 'attribs' key. A "'readonly' => 'readonly'" attribs
- key-value pair has the same effect as "'disable' => true".

I've removed the obsolete language in the docblock comment in r4330
