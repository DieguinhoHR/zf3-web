### Description

Zend\_Locale::getTranslation('155', 'RegionToTerritory', 'en');

return AT BE CH DE DD FR FX LI LU MC NL

"DD" is an old country code for "East Germany", and "FX" stand for "Metropolitan France".

Is this correct to return "East Germany" as region of "Western Europe" ?

Zend\_Locale::getTranslation('DD', 'Territory', 'fr') and Zend\_Locale::getTranslation('FX', 'Territory', 'fr') does not provide any translation.

Both are correct.

When you see this as problem then please report an issue to the CLDR team ( <http://unicode.org/cldr> ) who is the maintainer of the used library.
