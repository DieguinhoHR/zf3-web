ZF-6848: Zend\_Session doesn't handle memcache failover
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

memcache extension allows for failover (memcache.allow\_failover = 1) and can be used as a session handler (session.save\_handler = memcache)

Unfortunately when failover happens a notice is thrown which is intercepted by Zend\_Session and converted into exception. So instead of failover some users cannot access the site.

Zend\_Session\_Exception' with message 'Zend\_Session::start() - library/Zend/Session.php(Line:438): session\_start() function.session-star Server x (tcp 11211) failed with: Connection refused in /home/sites/shared/library/Zend/Session.php:444

I did some more investigating looking for workarounds. Ignoring notice might not be an option because the same will happen if last server failed and no failover was possible. Checking for return value of session\_start() could be a good idea but it would only work for php 5.3.0 where this function allegedly returns false.

We are using a older ZF version with a custom memcache/DbTable session handler which also triggers this error when one of our memcache servers is down. (memcache.allow\_failover=1 and memcache.redundancy=2 is set in our php.ini)

This seems to be fixed in later versions of ZF by allowing notices to be ignored by the error handler ( Zend\_Session::setOptions(array('throw\_startup\_exceptions' => E\_ALL ^ E\_NOTICE)); ).
