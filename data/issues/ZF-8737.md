Are you on trunk?

Image shows original posting with correct UTF-8 character display

No

I have run the process using the latest trunk and confirm the issue is NOT fixed.

Any thoughts - happy to do some debugging with some guidance

It works for me.

Check your browser and server are doing utf-8

I can view #twitterart no worries

Hi Brett,

Are you seeing #twitterart in your browser directly or via the Zend\_Service\_Twitter PHP library output as described above?

Regards Bob

Hi Bob,

I use the zend\_Service\_Twitter calls and after authenticating I do this

$id =7245855505; $timeline = $twitter->statusShow($id); print $timeline->text;

when I do a print\_r ($timeline); I don't see deformed utf-8 text.

My page html header has this meta tag

And on my xampp server I have changed the php.ini file to use UTF-8 by default

; PHP's built-in default is text/html default\_mimetype = "text/html" default\_charset = "UTF-8"

I don't see where the problem is. Currently all that is done is the result object is returned with what ever encoding is set and I think that's the way it should be as pointed out by Brett Cooper.

I'll run this by Matthew to get Zend view on it.

Hello all,

Firstly, thank you for checking this.

I must apologize as I have found the problem and its now fixed, so no issue with the libraries.

There were two problems: 1. Internally, I was using htmlentities on the text field before saving the data to the database, but without specifying the character set, so essentially I was using the default charset of ISO-8859-1. This caused the original corruption I was seeing in the database itself (not shown here).

1. In my efforts in putting the above case together (and you'll note not using htmlentities at all), I was echoing the result in a putty ssh window, which unfortunately also defaults to ISO-8859-1, so I was seeing the corruption again which made me think it was the library processing of the twitter status. Rechecking the tests above from your feedback, I just happened to be using an iMac whose shell terminal defaults to UTF8 and the problem magically disappeared - it was then just a matter of debugging the difference between putty and mac.

Thanks for your efforts - this case can be closed as a non-issue.

Regards Bob
