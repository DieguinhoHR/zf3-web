### Description

Due to a bug in Zend\_Http\_Client (ZF-8057) disabling authentication on the HTTP client before setting the URI results in a fatal error and thus making the whole class pretty useless. The simple workaround for the issue is to call Zend\_Http\_Client::setUri() before calling any other method of the object.

Moves Zend\_Http\_Client::setUri before any other Zend\_Http\_Client method call.

I think it is duplicate of ZF-7990
