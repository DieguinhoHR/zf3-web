### Description

The bug with a Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch

When using custom routes it will not work at all. In function public function initContext($format = null)..... $action = $request->getActionName(); This action will be always null so context will not be switched.

By changing it to $action = $request->getActionName(); if (empty($action)) { $action = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getDefaultAction(); } It working fine.

We are running into this same issue with ZF 1.11.5. I'd be willing to help patch this, but is @ivan fix the correct way to fix this, or is there a better place?

In ZendFramework-1.11.10 this problem still exists. I tried using a different layout for mobile devices with Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch. After a long time searching for bugs in my code, I Googled and ran into this bug report.

The problem lies much deeper than Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http. The problem is that the default controller (index) and the default action (index) are never being set by the Router at all. The router fully relies on the config file as this code shows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function getInstance(Zend_Config $config)
    {
        $defs = ($config->defaults instanceof Zend_Config) ? $config->defaults->toArray() : array();
        $map = ($config->map instanceof Zend_Config) ? $config->map->toArray() : array();
        $reverse = (isset($config->reverse)) ? $config->reverse : null;
        return new self($config->route, $defs, $map, $reverse);
    }
    
    public function __construct($route, $defaults = array(), $map = array(), $reverse = null)
    {
        $this->_regex    = $route;
        $this->_defaults = (array) $defaults;
        $this->_map      = (array) $map;
        $this->_reverse  = $reverse;
    }

Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard on the other hand _does know_ what the default action and the default controller are, because they are inherited from Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract where they are both hardcoded as properties. They are however never passed to the request object.

When the controller name or action name is missing in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http this should (in my opinion) raise an exception so that users know what the problem is, because other functionality breaks when these parameters are missing. An other solutions could be setting the default controller and default action in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http. They are documented as the default value when not provided by the user, but when the user forgets them, they are not being set.

See: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.quickstart.html#zend.controller.quickstart.go.controller) ??If no action is provided, the action index is assumed, and if no controller is provided, the controller index is assumed (following the Apache convention that maps a DirectoryIndex automatically).??

The easiest fix for now is too hardcode the controller and action in the routing.

This _does not_ work when using ContextSwitch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.router.routes.default.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex"
    resources.router.routes.default.route = "([a-z0-9]*(?:/[a-z0-9]+)*)"
    resources.router.routes.default.defaults.module = "default"
    resources.router.routes.default.map.1 = "page"


This _does work_ when using ContextSwitch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.router.routes.default.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex"
    resources.router.routes.default.route = "([a-z0-9]*(?:/[a-z0-9]+)*)"
    resources.router.routes.default.defaults.module = "default"
    resources.router.routes.default.defaults.controller = "index"
    resources.router.routes.default.defaults.action = "index"
    resources.router.routes.default.map.1 = "page"


It would be nice if this bug gets fixed after more than 2 and a half years. If more info is needed, just let me know.
