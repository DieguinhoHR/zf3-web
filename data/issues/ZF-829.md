### Description

Hi,

the abstract class Zend\_View\_Abstract don't implement methods to delete/unset setted/added [script | helper | filter] directories but the Zend\_View\_\* helper and filter files are added automatic.

If I don't use your helper or filter this directories will include anyway ( performance ? )

First: to reset the filter, helper, and script paths, simply call the relevant setter method with an empty value:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->setScriptPath('');
    $view->setHelperPath('');
    $view->setFilterPath('');


You are correct -- it still keeps the paths to the Zend\_View\_Helper/\_Filter classes; these are not removed, as they are considered standard functionality for Zend\_View.

However, the classes in the helper and filter paths are lazy loaded -- i.e., included only when called. If you never call one of the standard helpers or filters, the classes will never be loaded.
