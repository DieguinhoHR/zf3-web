### Description

Add module support for Zend\_Translate similar to this solution: [http://blog.vandenbos.org/2009/07/…](http://blog.vandenbos.org/2009/07/09/zend-framework-per-module-translation-sources/)

Every module has its own language dir, e.g.: application/modules/user/lang The translations have to be ADDED to (not replace) the Zend\_Translate-Instance and stored in Registry with the default 'Zend\_Translate'-key

The attached blog does not mention anything which is not possible by using Zend\_Translate.

Zend\_Translate accepts to have multiple modules... see into the manual: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.using.html) -> file structured sources.

You should simply use addTranslation() and not create a new instance when you want to add translation to an existing object.

Yeah, it is possible to write an own bootstrap resource or plugin for that. The point is that a module config file setting overwrites the application config for translation if not handled by own code (This is described in the blog) So you have the one or the other but i want it combined - and this functionality should Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Translate provide by default (for modules). I think this would be an good improvement...

.. so maybe this issue is more related to Zend\_Application\_Resource instead of Zend\_Translate

Reassigning to Zend-Application-Resource component maintainer

Closing as "Wont' Fix". The deadline has passed for adding new features to what will be the last minor release of ZF1 (1.12). The blog post referenced in the ticket description provides a suitable workaround for the issue, and both Zend\_Translate and Zend\_Application are being rewritten from scratch in ZF2 so the issue does not apply there.
