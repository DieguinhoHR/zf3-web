### Description

When we using modular application and some kinds of resources for example: "router","frontcontroller", etc.

This resources initialized many times (as many as amount of modules).

How to reproduce: Simple put debug message after line 556 of \\Zend\\Application\\AbtractBootstrap like that:


    <pre class="highlight">
    $plugin = $broker->load($resource);
    $return = $plugin->init();
    \Zend\Debug::dump($resource);
    unset($this->_started[$resourceName]);
    $this->_markRun($resourceName);


By this code you can see that resources initialized by broker multiple times.

That happens because we call "\_markRun" method of module bootstrap, but we should call broker to mark this resource like initialized per broker not per every bootstrap.

I tried to fix that, but to much linkage between resources there.
