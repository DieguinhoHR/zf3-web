### Description

[edit] When adding two Between validators, both of them don't work anymore.

expected output: 1 (or $input->isValid('year') == true)

but in the sample code $input->isValid('year') == false [/edit]

Sample Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validators = array(
      'year' => array(
        new Zend_Validate_Digits(),
        new Zend_Validate_StringLength(2,4),
        new Zend_Validate_Between(1000,3000),
        new Zend_Validate_Between(10,99))
    );
    
    $ar = array("year"=>"15");
    $input = new Zend_Filter_Input(array(), $validators, $ar);
    echo $input->isValid('year');

Hi Tim,

When making issue reports, it is a good practice to describe what you expected the result of code to be, and what the actual result was. This can help a lot for people reading the issue report.

See [http://chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html/](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) for a good article on writing good bug reports.

Ok I have run the code. It finds the year "15" is not valid, so isValid() returns false. getMessages() returns an error message "'15' is not between '1000' and '3000', inclusively"

This is the intended behavior of a validator chain. All validators in the chain must pass, or else the input is not considered valid.

It is not clear from your problem report what is wrong in this case.

You are right, this is not a bug. This thread can be closed.

Thanks Tim, I am resolving this as "not an issue".
