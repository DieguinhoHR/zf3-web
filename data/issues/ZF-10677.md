ZF-10677: Zend\_Pdf\_StringParser uses PHP 5.2.5 escape sequences (eg. \\f)

### Description

Although " [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.introduction.html) " states :

"Zend recommends the most current release of PHP [...], and currently supports PHP 5.2.4 or later."

it is not possible to use Zend\_Pdf (Zend\_Pdf\_StringParser) with PHP 5.2.4.

The problem comes from special escape sequences introduced only in PHP 5.2.5 :

- [http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/…](http://ca3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.double)
- eg. \\f form feed (FF or 0x0C (12) in ASCII) (since PHP 5.2.5)

The "\\f" escape sequence appears at several places in "Zend/Pdf/StringParser.php" and maybe elsewhere in the Zend\_Pdf package.

My current specific problem is "startxref" that is truncated to "startxre" because "\\f" is handled as "f".

I recommend using "\\x0C" instead and still support PHP 5.2.4.

Thank you!

ZF-8791 solves te startxref issue, however errors relating this issue still exist.
==================================================================================

The error I get loading a pdf file is:

An error occurred while processing a request (Zend\_Pdf\_Exception). Message: Argument must be numeric The error occurred in /var/www/versions/20110801-1205/library/Zend/Pdf/Element/Numeric.php at line 55. Trace: Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Numeric->\_\_construct( 'alse' )

Apparently 'F' in 'False' is cut.

Proposed solution by Sylvain solves this issue. So replase all instances of \\f by \\x0C in Zend\_Pdf\_StringParser. The hack from #ZF-8791 that contains a phpversion check can be replaced.

Thank you so much for your hint Loek and Sylvain.
