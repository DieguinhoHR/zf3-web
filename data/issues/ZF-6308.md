ZF-6308: Being able to display 404 error if module is not found 
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

On Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php around line 383 Zend\_Controller\_Exception is thrown if the module is not found. However if error plugin is used in the following fashion:

Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->registerPlugin( new Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_ErrorHandler( array('module'=>'errorhandler', 'controller' => 'error', 'action' => 'error')));

the only way to distinquish the module not found (404) from application error (500) is to check the error message. There are two possible solutions:

1) Throw Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception in Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php around line 383 instead of Zend\_Controller\_Exception

2) Add code 404 to the mentioned exception. this causes ErrorPlugin to set error type to EXCEPTION\_NO\_ACTION.
