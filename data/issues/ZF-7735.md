ZF-7735: Lost database connection after running one process unix
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I create many process unix with the library ZendX\_Console\_Process\_Unix. When the first one is running, I loose the database connection. Indeed, when I access the DB before running the first thread, there is no problem but after I launch the first one this problem occurs : SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away

Perhaps when the child process is killed, the connection object is also destruct.

Do you have any ideas where the problem come from ?

Thank you for you consideration.

Matthieu

This actually is not a bug within ZF. See the comments on [http://us.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php#70721). Within the \_run() function, you need to initialize a new connection to the db since MySQL doesn't like everything sharing the same connection. In the app where I encountered this issue, I'm using Doctrine. To resolve this, I just reran the connect with a different connection name.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $options = $GLOBALS['application']->getBootstrap()->getOptions();
            $dbOptions = $options['resources']['db']['params'];
            Doctrine_Manager::connection(
                $options['resources']['db']['doctrineAdapter'] .
                '://' .
                $dbOptions['username'] .
                ':' .
                $dbOptions['password'] .
                '@' .
                $dbOptions['host'] .
                '/' .
                $dbOptions['dbname'],
                'cron' . $this->getVariable('cronjobId')
            );


I imagine using Zend\_Db would work much the same way.
