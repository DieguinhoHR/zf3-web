### Description

 <?php $\_POST['email'] = 'test@zend.com'; require\_once 'Zend/Filter/Input.php'; $filterPost = new Zend\_Filter\_Input($\_POST); var\_dump($filterPost->testEmail('email')); ?> returns false. expected true in this case.

I think you missed that

$filterPost = new Zend\_Filter\_Input($\_POST['email']);

I don't think so.

$filterPost->getAlnum('email');

works as expected. Why should I do $filterPost = new Zend\_Filter\_Input($\_POST['email']);? I want to filter $\_POST not an element of Post.

By the way, it's documented like I did ;)

Zend\_Filter\_Input::testEmail relies on Zend\_Filter::isEmail, which unfortunately, does not have any code in it.

More info: [ZF-42] Probably even more on the mailing list.

Reassigning from Jayson to Bill Karwin, pending further triage.
