### Description

I have a big query and a lots of data.So i have to use pagination.But i have to write the query in which all the data are fetched and then pass in the pagination class. but i want the only 15 row and query should be like that limit 15 and only when i click on page 2 then another 15-30 query should be executed. So it consume less time and if i want to see only 1st page then i don't wait for more time. Now i have to wait until all the data are not fetched.Is there any kind of way to write a paging query that i want?
