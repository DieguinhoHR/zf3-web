### Description

I have a string, version of an os: "4.10", Zend\_Json encode it as a number, with no quotes, but when it is evaluted in JS, the lastes 0 is throwed off.

In js [4.10] is evaluted to 4.1.

I already made a patch for this, in \\Json\\Encoder.php the \_encodeDatum function from Zend\_Json\_Encoder class.

After

 
        if (is_numeric($value)) {
            $result = (string)$value;


Add

 
            if (substr($result,-1,1) == '0') {
                $result = $this->_encodeString($value);
            }

Fixed with a previous commit; 1433 adds a test that verifies the fix.
