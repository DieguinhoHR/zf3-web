### Description

The example present in [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.set.html) with the title "Decryption with Mcrypt" seems outdated, the following line: $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Decrypt('myencryptionkey');

should be changed to: $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Decrypt(array('key' => 'myencryptionkey'));

Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_\_construct($options) tells us: if (is\_string($options)) { $options = array('key' => $options); } ...

true, but Zend\_Filter\_Decrypt expect the string parameter to be the adapter name :)

Fixed with GH-73
