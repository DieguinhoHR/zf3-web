### Description

From the mailing list (by Tom Auinger):
=======================================

I just found that the Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface class includes the Zend\_Controller\_Front class on line 26 (in ZF 1.0.3):

require\_once 'Zend/Controller/Front.php';

However, this class is never used within the interface.

Removing this include would increase performance when using the router interface without the front controller.

==============================

Additionaly:

Route interface should have an additional method:

public static function getInstance(Zend\_Config $config);

And then Module Router needs some additional require statements:

Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface

Fixed in revision 7444. Changelog:

Cleaned interfaces of unneeded classes and added some missing. Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Abstract: moved inclusion of Front controller (now JIT) to allow more lightweight subclassing  
 Lazy loading exceptions
