### Description

When I'm trying to use this backend i get two errors. First is triggered by mkdir function in Zend/Cache/Backend/Static.php on line 244. The directory id prepended by / and looks like this: /C:\\wamp\\www\\projectname... Second error is triggered by file\_put\_contents function in Zend/Cache/Backend/Static.php on line 209 because file name is invalid - C:\\wamp\\www\\projectname\\html./\\x120html.

Added patch that fixes the static cache issue on Windows. Mkdir can also recursively create directories, so in the patch I used that and removed the protected createDirectoriesFor method.

I agree with the patch [Static.php.patch](http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/attachment/12974/Static.php.patch).

It makes no sense to try to create directories with method $this->\_createDirectoriesFor($pathName) line 226, already that in line 225 used the function <a href="">www.php.net/realpath</a>" rel="nofollow">realpath case no exists the directory the function return false.

As of fixing bug ZF-9642 - Please test if this bug was fixed, too?
