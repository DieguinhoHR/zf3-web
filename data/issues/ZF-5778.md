ZF-5778: Filtering messages which are not strings
-------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hi.

Some log writers like the firebug one are capable of logging arrays, but Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Message only accepts strings (by passing $event['message'] to preg\_match() directly).

Proposed modification:

public function accept($event) { $message = $event['message']; if(is\_array($event['message'])) { $message = var\_export($message,TRUE); }

 
    return preg_match($this->_regexp, $message) > 0;


}

Such that it won't throw the warning "preg\_match() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in /usr/share/httpd/ZendFramework-1.7.4/library/Zend/Log/Filter/Message.php"
