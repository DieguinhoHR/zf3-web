### Description

[from Geoffroy [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/34276)]

I have an issue with the Zend\_Mail due to Safe mode. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?

$mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $mail->setBodyText('Hello') ->setFrom('xxxx@mail.com', 'XX') ->addTo('xxxx@mail.com') ->setSubject('Welcome!') ->send();

Warning: mail() [function.mail]: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The fifth parameter is disabled in SAFE MODE. in /lib/Zend/Mail/Transport/Sendmail.php on line 91

The warning gets raised although the fifth parameter is null (it is null most of the time). I didn't remove the warning as I can't, because the parameters could be important and the warning tells you what's wrong in safe-mode. But if the parameters are null mail() is now called without this fifth function parameter.
