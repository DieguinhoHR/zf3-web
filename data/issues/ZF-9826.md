ZF-9826: Zend\_Session\_Namespace iteration doesn't preserve numeric keys

### Description

After storing data with numeric keys in a Zend\_Session\_Namespace object, accessing it with a foreach (as proposed in the documentation under "Iterating Over Session Namespaces") won't keep the keys (indexes) that were stored.

This is not really a bug, since resetting numeric keys is a documented behavior of array\_merge (used in Zend\_Session\_Abstract::\_namespaceGetAll()). Anyway I think that if it is going to work this way, it should be specified in the Zend\_Session\_Namespace documentation too.

A dirty solution to the issue could be to transparently transform numeric keys into string keys, maybe by prepending some string to them.
