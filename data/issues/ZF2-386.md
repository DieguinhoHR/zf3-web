ZF2-386: Improper escaping in Db\\Sql\\Select join conditions
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Using parentheses in join conditions causes incorrect quoting. For example:

$select = new Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Select; $select->from('foo')->join('bar', '(foo.foo\_id = bar.bar\_id OR foo.bar\_id = bar.bar\_id) AND (foo.a = bar.a)');

results in the join condition being:

SELECT "foo".\*, "bar".\* FROM "foo" INNER JOIN "bar" ON "(foo"."foo\_id" = "bar"."bar\_id" OR "foo"."bar\_id" = "bar"."bar\_id)" AND "(foo"."a" = "bar"."a)"

This can be remedied by placing spaces between parentheses and identifiers. However, this is solution is neither ideal nor immediately obvious.

Additionally, it is currently not possible (as far as I am aware) to use expressions like CONCAT in join conditions, again due to improper escaping. An acceptable alternative might be to accept a Db\\Sql\\Expression as a join condition and leave escaping up to the user in that case.
