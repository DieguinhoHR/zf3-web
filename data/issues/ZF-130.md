### Description

The incubator version of Zend\_Http\_Client uses HTTP/1.1 by default setting, but it does not support Transfer-Encoding: chunked decoding.

RFC2068#3.6 ( <http://rfc.net/rfc2068.html#s3.6> )

> All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the "chunked" transfer coding

For example Amazon ECS with REST API returns chunked encoded response, if client requests using HTTP/1.1.

I wrote Zend\_Http\_Client::\_read to support chunked encoding.

 
    protected function _read($socket)
    {
        $response = '';
    
        $transferEncodings = array();
    
        // read headers
        while (!feof($socket)) {
            $buff = fgets($socket);
            $response .= $buff;
            if (trim($buff, "\r\n") == '') {break;}
            if (preg_match('/^transfer-encoding:/i', $buff)) {
                $transferEncodings = explode(',',
                    str_replace(' ', '',
                        strtolower(
                            substr(trim($buff), strlen('transfer-encoding:'))
                        )
                    )
                );
            }
        }
    
        $chunked = false;
        if (in_array('chunked', $transferEncodings)) {
            $chunked = true;
            unset($transferEncodings[array_search('chunked', $transferEncodings)]);
        }
        if (count($transferEncodings) > 0) {
            throw new Zend_Http_Exception('Unsupported Transfer-Encoding: ' . implode(', ', $transferEncodings));
        }
    
        // read body
        if ($chunked) {
            while (!feof($socket)) {
                $buff = fgets($socket, 8192);
                @list($size, $ext) = explode(' ', trim($buff));
    
                // TODO - support chunk-ext
    
                $size = base_convert($size, 16, 10);
                if ($size == 0) {break;}
                $buff = '';
                while (strlen($buff) < $size) {
                    $buff .= fread($socket, $size - strlen($buff));
                    if (feof($socket)) {
                        throw new Zend_Http_Exception('HTTP stream abnormaly disconnected');
                    }
                }
                $response .= $buff;
    
                $buff = fgets($socket); // CRLF
            }
    
            // TODO - support entity-header
        } else {
            while (!feof($socket)) {
                $buff = fread($socket, 8192);
                $response .= $buff;
            }
        }
    
        fclose($socket);
        return $response;
    }

Hi,

In your code, you create an array out of the Transfer Encoding header by spiliting it's value on "," (commas).

I am not sure I understand why you do this - it seems to me that the only possible value of "Trasfer-Encoding" in HTTP/1.1 (or in HTTP/1.0 for that matter) is "chunked" - no standard defines any other possible value.

Also, HTTP/1.1 itself states that Trasfer-Encoding should contain (one) token - not a comma seperated list of tokens. It also states that a client should ignore Transfer-Encoding methods that it does not understand - so I am not sure if throwing an exception is the correct thing - I would suggest simply returning the body without decoding it, thus allowing the user to deal with it.

Can you point me to a website / server that returns comma seperated list of encodings or some similar behaviour so I can analyze it and test with it?

Thank you.

Sorry, I was misunderstanding about treatment of "Transfer-Encoding" . (and read obsolete RFC, too)

Your point is right, and in my code "Transfer-Encoding" header was treated wrong way.

it will be fixed at following points

- ignore unknown encodings, and not throw exception
- one "Transfer-Encoding" header line has no comma-separated values.(but it can allow transfer-extension separated by ";")

I have modified the Zend\_Http\_Response class to support chunked body decoding (in the getBody() method) - the idea is to also implement things like gzip decompression or other decoding in the same place.

I also added the getRawBody() method to the response to allow access to the raw (undecoded) body.

Before I commit this, I would like to run some tests - I have tested with <http://jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/ChunkedScript> and it looks fine. I didn't really find a way to "force" chunked encoding on Apache - so it is hard for me to test this feature. Can you direct me to web pages you had problems with?

I had chunked encoding problems with Amazon ECS REST API. (to use Zend\_Service\_Amazon with incubator version of Zend\_Http\_Client)

Test code to get a response using chunked encoding is here.
-----------------------------------------------------------

$socket = fsockopen('webservices.amazon.co.jp', 80); fwrite($socket, "GET /onca/xml?ResponseGroup=Request&SubscriptionId=1CM8G848FE80MFK7JK02&Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=4774128104 HTTP/1.1\\r\\n"); fwrite($socket, "Host: webservices.amazon.co.jp\\r\\n"); fwrite($socket, "Connection: close\\r\\n"); fwrite($socket, "\\r\\n"); while (!feof($socket)) { echo fread($socket, 8192); }

fclose($socket);
----------------

and response is
---------------

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 24 Jun 2006 09:42:54 GMT Server: Server x-amz-id-1: 035SS9PYS085GC8MAC70 x-amz-id-2: wvBNFEXLw1SCXiU3XP8eaFkPe4f/9qChbXRsJr8VTb8= Connection: close Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8

I tested the url you sent and the new code seemed to be working properly. I got a well-formed XML response back.

I have commited the new Response.php - please test your code again with revision 706

If it is fixed- please report here.

I tested my code with Zend\_Http\_Reponse version 706 and It works fine. Thank you.

Fixed by adding Zend\_Http\_Response the ability to decode chunked messages. No changes to Zend\_Http\_Client.
