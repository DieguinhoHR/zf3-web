ZF-4986: Refactor Zend\_Pdf\_Page: View Helper pattern
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-11-19T01:16:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:48.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

It is possible, without much performance overhead, to refactor Zend\_Pdf\_Page to implement a view helper pattern for all its drawing capabilities.

This way people can easily plugin their own features and those of others, that faciliate the basic drawing capabilites to do stuff like tables, headers, whatever.

This change would include using the PluginLoader for loading of the helpers. It would not change backwards compability since Zend\_Pdf\_Page::\_\_call would proxy against the helpers.

To even make backwards compability no problem at all, one could think about letting the basic "already defined" options part of Zend\_Pdf\_Page and only put extra helpers into the plugin loader \_\_call circle.
