### Description

- The test-coverage for all Zend\_Soap\_ components is too low.
- Special cases are not checked. Many tests cannot fail (or hardly ever do so) due to non test driven construction.
- Tests have to be more end-user centric, not so much check for obvious fucntionality.

As of r12294 Zend\_Soap\_Server has an extended test-coverage.
