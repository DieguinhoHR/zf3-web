ZF-3241: getHeaders should return headers in the same form in Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract and Zend\_Http\_Response

### Description

The getHeaders functions on these two methods just return the internal store of headers. Unfortunately, they store the data differently.

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract: Array of headers. Each header is an array with keys 'name' and 'value' Zend\_Http\_Response: Headers are stored in an array in the form 'name' => 'value' ( line 170: $this->headers[ucwords(strtolower($name))] = $value; )

It would seem to make sense for them to be harmonised.

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

I agree that this should be as consistent as possible.

Matthew - what do you think is the best approach?

We need to keep in mind that this breaks BC.

Shahar.

Postponing, as it would be a BC break at this time.
