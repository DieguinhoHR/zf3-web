### Description

after htmlspecialchars() a word like "Rétablir" containing accentuated caracter output like this "R�tablir" htmlentities() works in the same way as htmlspecialchars() but works on more caracters when I use htmlentities() "Rétablir" output correctly as "Rétablir"

my source file are UTF8 encoded my apache send HTML in UTF8

if there is no special reason to use htmlspecialchars(). I propose to replace all the call made to htmlspecialchars() in view and helper with htmlentities(). This will permit the generalisation of the $this->escape() practise in view, including for people using accentuated caracters and the security will be better for every user of the Zend framework

The 0.1.3 version was also affected

sample using the FormReset Helper with the text Rétablir. The other accentuated caracters viewable on this screen are treated with htmlentities()

I don't think that this is an error of htmlspecialchars(). It seems your script is not properly utf-8 encoded.

Try these examples

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
    echo htmlspecialchars("utf-8 encoded: t\xC3\xA9st") . '<br></br>';  // utf-8 encoded tést
    echo htmlspecialchars("iso-8859-1 encoded: t\xE9st"); // iso-8859-1 encoded tést


Result is: utf8 encoded: tést iso-8859-1 encoded: t[questionmarksign]st

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    header('Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1');
    echo htmlspecialchars("utf-8 encoded: t\xC3\xA9st") . '<br></br>';  // utf-8 encoded tést
    echo htmlspecialchars("iso-8859-1 encoded: t\xE9st"); // iso-8859-1 encoded tést


Result is: utf8 encoded: tÃ©st iso-8859-1 encoded: tést

Please see ZF-341 for an example solution and recommendations.

Revision 1429 addresses this issue by enforcing UTF-8 encoding when using htmlspecialchars or htmlentities throughout the Zend\_View codebase.

Please check out latest svn and advise if this corrects the issue.

Due to the nature of the security announcement sent out by Stefan Esser earlier this week ([[http://hardened-php.net/advisory\_132006.138.html/](http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_132006.138.html)]), I'm going to modify how this works:

- By default, encode to ISO-8859-1 (latin1)
- Add a setEncoding() accessor to allow setting encoding for escaping actions

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

Final changes added in revision 1902. Default encoding is ISO-8859-1 (latin1). set/getEncoding() accessors added so this setting may be changed by the developer:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');


escape() will then use the encoding specified when filtering through htmlspecialchars() or htmlentities().
