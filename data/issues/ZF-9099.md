### Description

for example when query by 'input#\_\_VIEWSTATE', the Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2Xpath::\_tokenize() does not translate it to xpath expression as expected 'input[@id="\_\_VIEWSTATE"]';

 

 

### Comments

Workaround exists that to use the attribute search directly, like "input[@id="\_\_VIEWSTATE"]"
