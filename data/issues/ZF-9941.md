ZF-9941: Zend\_Currency::toCurrency() options
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-06-03T04:36:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-06-04T07:56:27.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.6 (22/Jun/10)

### Description

I think there is a bug in Zend/Currency.php, Line: 140:

if (is\_array($value) && isset($options['value'])) {

.. which should be :

if (isset($options['value'])) {

.. because if variable $value is strictly null it will never by an array and 'value' from the options array will be skipped and the one from $this->\_options will be used.

The framework code works like expected. Please give some reproduceable code for the problem you have.

$currency = new Zend\_Currency( array( 'value' => 1000, ) );

echo $currency->toCurrency(null, array('value' => 2000)); // 1000

I think it should return 2000. Though if it is expected behavior the statement in Line #139 remains pointless:

 
        if ($value === null) {
            if (is_array($value) && isset($options['value'])) {


because null !== array()
