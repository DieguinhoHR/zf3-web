### Description

You can't translate default Route (Route\_Module), because it doesn't have abilities to do it. Additionaly, you can't use other route as default , which can translate, because only Route\_Module handle right requests (as /[module/][controller/][action/], where everything is optional, module too).

Default, my patch doesn't change anything. If you change default route to something like:

 
    'default' => array(
        'type' => 'Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Module',
        'dispatcher' => null,
        'request' => null,
        'translatable' => true
    )


you get abilities to translate default route. I think there should be also static method changing this ability (ie. Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module::setTranslate(bool); )

Deleting Zend\_Translate as effected component because this is no Zend\_Translate issue.

The provided patch does not work correctly when matching translated modules. I adapted it so that it also correctly handles translated module names and attached a new patch.

This patch replaces the previous one, which did not match translated module names.

Hi I'm using the patch in production, so far so good. I had to make a little change in the code although. Instead of defaulting \_translatable to false in the \_\_contruct method, I've set it to true and now everything works fine. I don't quite undestancd what \_translatable is for...

As in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module patch, this is set to false in the constructor and never again manipulated afterwards... On the contrary in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route, the similar variable \_translatable is initialized in the contructor, looking for segments to translate in the url (looking for "@" sign...).

Hope this helps.

hi,

this issue exists nearly a year, an nobody seems really to care.

i don't get it, actually this is a basic functionality and should be handled on major priority.

I also posted a, from my perspective, major issue affecting the basic JSON serialization. (<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9416>) This was fixed after nearly 3 month. This is a completely unacceptable timeframe for every kind of project.

I don't know if you guys are payed by zend or if you doing it for fun in your freetime, but by next project will not base on the ZF.

When is this going to be fixed? It does not only affect version 1.8.4, but all version up to and including 1.11.3.
