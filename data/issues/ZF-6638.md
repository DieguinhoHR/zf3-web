### Description

I am having issue where my Flex app is connecting to my Zend AMF web service, and when it pass up an argument (in my case a string) when the argument reaches the PHP side of things, it is not a string at all, it's a number.

Here is what my Flex code looks like (I am using the UM Cairngorm Extensions method of delegating service calls):

public function getSortableByType($type:String):void { var token:AsyncToken = service.getSortableByType('category'); var handlers:Callbacks = new Callbacks(\_\_onResults\_getSortableByType, \_\_onFault\_getSortableByType);

 
            prepareHandlers(token, handlers);
        }


And here is what my PHP code looks like:

public function getSortableByType($type) { Zend\_Registry::getInstance()->log->info(print\_r($type), true);

 
        return array();
    }


I'm just trying to trace out what the variable is, and this is what I get in my logs:

2009-05-13T11:04:22-07:00 INFO (6): 1

That number 1 is where it should be tracing my string

Here is what my Firebug header readout looks liek for this request:

time 12:39:43.80 :: mx.messaging.Channel :: 'my-zendamf' channel sending message: (mx.messaging.messages::RemotingMessage)#0 body = (Array)#1 [0] "category" clientId = "55BC6944-74E4-EEE8-7363-00005297F0B7" destination = "zend-amf" headers = (Object)#2 messageId = "DF92F941-43DA-C763-BD03-3B7CBEF379C3" operation = "getSortableByType" source = "MainServices" timestamp = 0 timeToLive = 0

Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?
