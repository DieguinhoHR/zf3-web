### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/27>

I would like to suggest allowing the fetch/find methods of Zend\_Db\_Table to accept a $forUpdate boolean parameter.

That is in Zend\_Db\_Table:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function find($val) // would become
    function find($val, $forUpdate = false)
    
    function fetchRow($where = null, $order = null) // would become
    function fetchRow($where = null, $order = null, $forUpdate = false)
    
    function fetchAll($where = null, $order = null, $count = null, $offset = null) // would become
    function fetchAll($where = null, $order = null, $count = null, $offset = null, $forUpdate = false)


Note: Zend\_Db\_Table::find() would especially benefit from this syntax.

This would make it much easier for developpers to keep database integrity and would also make the Zend\_Db\_Table more widely accepted.

There should also be support for SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE, and the corresponding locking modes in SQLite ( <http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html> ), and similar for the other adapters. This issue is closely related to, and overlaps with, [ZF-40], although I believe [ZF-40] should be a higher priority.

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

'FOR UPDATE' can now be passed to a Zend\_Db\_Table find/fetch operation by passing the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select query. See ZF1.5 PR1 or newer.
