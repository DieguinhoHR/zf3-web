### Description

While implementing a Zend\_Queue with the DB-Adapter, I had problems figuring out how to retrieve a previously created Queue-Object. This is not mentioned in the docs that this is done via the "name"-attribute. Something like: <http://pastie.org/821495> could do the job (thx to jsor in #zftalk)
