### Description

We're using a database table to store images as blobs. Everything is done with Zend\_Db\_Table, the save function that is finally used is Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::save()

We're tracing memory usage with php's memory\_get\_usage() function and write that to firebug console with the logger. From there I can see that when saving such a row with an image sized 13.8 MB it consumes about 55 MB of memory for that operation. It seems the the amount of memory used id quite 4 times as big as the image itself.

I assume the reason are all the array operations in \_\_insert()?

What I found strange is that the used memory is still bigger after the save operation, compared to before the save() operation, so looks like some stuff is kept in memory?

I guess blobs are not a usuas use case, but maybe someone can find a way to improve that?

Best regards, Anton
