### Description

I like to integrate Zend\_Captcha in an old project - but i need to create an instance of Zend\_View only to fit the first argument of Zend\_Captcha\_Adapter::render().

 <?php $captcha = new Zend\_Captcha\_Dump() $id = $captcha->generate(); echo $captcha->render(new Zend\_View()); ?> Would it not be better, to make the first argument optional? Currently no adapter use the first argument! Future one might - but they can check this and throw an exception if its not present.
