### Description

I have had a problem with the "zf create project" and "zf create module". When I do create a project in the command line, it does include the library (with Zend classes) using the following line: set\_include\_path(implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, array( realpath(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../library'), get\_include\_path(), )));

But it also include a line in the application.ini: includePaths.library = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../library"

when I try to create a new module, I get an error that I could not redefine the Zend\_Loader class.

Looking for it, I have discovered that commenting the line in application.ini all goes right, no more problems. I guess it is a bug, isn´t it? Or my aproach was wrong to solve the problem?

Error ocurred when the line in application.ini is not commented.

This was fixed as part of the 1.10.x release series.
