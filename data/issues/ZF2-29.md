### Description

In Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor there is a protected property that handle (for the widget dijit.Editor) all the params (in this version captureEvents, events and plugins) that need to be parsed like JSON params in the generated zendDijits var, but a main property of the editor 'extraPlugins' doesn't appears.

Now:

protected $\_jsonParams = array('captureEvents', 'events', 'plugins');

Expected:

protected $\_jsonParams = array('captureEvents', 'events', 'plugins', 'extraPlugins');
