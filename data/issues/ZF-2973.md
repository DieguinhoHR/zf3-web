### Description

line 62 of Validate/NotEmpty.php

if (empty($value)) {

should be replaced with

if (strlen($value) == 0) {

otherwise the "0" string will be seen as empty, but it isn't

In PHP "0" is supposed to be an empty string, see <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php>

i know how php handle a "0" string but it should be done differently in ZF context!

if a user types "0" in an input field, ZF should not say "hey the field is empty"

partially duplicated of bug ZF-2851 also if I think that the $value === "" is not the right choice

Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty is supposed to mimic PHP's built-in empty(). If you want to check for an empty string, use Zend\_Validate\_StringLength.

Also, changing the behavior of Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty as you suggest would introduce a serious BC break.

ok, anyway having the StringLength validator on a field and telling the user "this field should be at leat 1 char long" is not a nice thing, while telling "hey, this field is required" it's much better (only using default messages from ZF, not custom ones)

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
