### Description

I encountered a bit of a strange/unexpected behaviour when using Zend\_Form\_Element, a textarea specifically. Text was assigned to the element and saved into the database (UTF-8). That worked fine. Default encoding for Zend\_View seems to be UTF-8 whereas my HTML document's encoding is ISO-8859-1. Form element decorator used the view object (with encoding set to UTF-8) to render a text area, however, this resulted to an empty textarea with no value displayed whatsoever. It appears that the text entered into the text area was not encoded in UTF-8 and htmlspecialchars [1] silently dropped the whole string as some/all of the characters were not UTF-8 encoded.

Would it be possible to raise an exception (or another type of error event) when encoding of the string does not match the encoding specified in view?

I fixed this behaviour for me by setting the "resources.view.encoding" value in my application.ini to the right encoding - for me it was ISO-8859-1.

I think it would be helpful, if the $\_encoding variable in Zend/View/Abstract.php would default to an empty string or null. This would make PHP automatically determine the encoding which worked very well for me.

Set the encoding: \* [by Zend\_View object](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.introduction.html#zend.view.introduction.options) \* [by Zend\_Application](http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/zend.application.available-resources.html#zend.application.available-resources.view)
