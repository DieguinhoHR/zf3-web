### Description

Here is the code works wrong on RHEL 4 x86\_64 systems:

$directory = "/tmp/lucene\_dir";

Zend\_Search\_Lucene::create($directory); //directory content creates ok, //but the following code produces the exception with "Wrong segments file format" message body and blocks working with index at all $storage\_instance = Zend\_Search\_Lucene::open($directory);

Seems to be related to 64bit Integers/Floats. Had a equal problem with Zend\_Locale\_Format in the past.

The RHEL 5 with its PHP 5.1.6 have the same problem

Found root cause. The code does not work only if encoded by Zend Guard. The text version works fine. Any comments/suggestions?

Closing as not an issue as this is an issue specific to encoding with Zend Guard.
