### Description

I'm not sure if this is a bug or if adobe reader just render the colors differently. Anytime I chose a html color picker and copy the color name/value to Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_Html the color rendered in a page has different saturation, it's much higher. It makes color selection a bit harder.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please provide a bit of reproduction code to demonstrate this issue. I am unable to reproduce.
