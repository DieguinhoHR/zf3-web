ZF-9645: Rest Client should allow specifying Accept header
----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

REST APIs can request specific Accept header specification in order to manage different Content-Type for GET requests.

At the moment, there's nothing apprently that could allow a Zend\_Http\_Client::setHeaders for an Accept header inside restGet() :-(

Thanks in advance.

$client = new Zend\_Rest\_Client("http://example.com/"); $http = new Zend\_Http\_Client(); $http->setHeaders('Accept', 'application/json'); $client->setHttpClient($http);

This solution works for me
