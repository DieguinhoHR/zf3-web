### Description

To make it easier for developers, we should add the ability to page through all feed results, using the atom:link#rel=next URLs. For GData properties, each of these next URLs contain a different start-index value, allowing for the paging of the results. Other APP services may provide this iteration capability differently, but through different query params/URLs.
