ZF-5698: Insufficient error checking is done on Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract select() method

### Description

No error checking is done on Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract select() method. This is an issue (at least for me) when you try to perform db-related actions on a disconnected row object, e.g. when I instantiate an object derived from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract using Zend\_Auth::getInstance()->getStorage() and then call a method on it.

The error given is simply "Fatal error at Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php line 398: method called on non-object". I believe that this is a common error for developers, and that throwing an exception here would be extremely helpful in debugging applications.

The fix is to alter the select() method to something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       /**
        * Returns an instance of the parent table's Zend_Db_Table_Select
    object.
        *
        * @return Zend_Db_Table_Select
        */
       public function select()
       {
         if(!($this->getTable() instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Abstract))
         {
           throw new Zend_Db_Exception("getTable did not return a
    Zend_Db_Table_Abstract object");
         }
         return $this->getTable()->select();
       }
