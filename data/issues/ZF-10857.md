<http://php.net/manual/function.include.php> If a path is defined — whether absolute (starting with a drive letter or \\ on Windows, or / on Unix/Linux systems) or relative to the current directory (starting with . or ..) — the include\_path will be ignored altogether.

-> ignore include\_path on windows if filename starts with a "\\"

Is this still an issue?
