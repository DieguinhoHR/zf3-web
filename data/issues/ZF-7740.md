### Description

On my system PHP's date() function can handle dates roughly between the dates 1901 to 2038. Zend\_Date also works fine inside this same range but when a date is outside this range the returned unix timestamp produced by calling get(Zend\_Date::TIMESTAMP) had the timezone offset added to the timestamp, which is wrong. Code to prove this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    date_default_timezone_set('EET');
    //December 6th 1917 10:10:10
    $timestamp = '-1643212190';
    $dateObj = new Zend_Date($timestamp);
    echo $timestamp . "\n";
    echo $dateObj->getTimestamp() . "\n";
    echo $dateObj->get(Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP) . "\n";
    //December 6th 1817 10:10:10
    $timestamp = '-4798885790';
    $dateObj = new Zend_Date($timestamp);
    echo $timestamp . "\n";
    echo $dateObj->getTimestamp() . "\n";
    echo $dateObj->get(Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP);


This produces the output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    -1643212190
    -1643212190
    -1643212190
    -4798885790
    -4798885790
    -4798878590


Why is the last unix timestamp not the same when calling get(Zend\_Date::TIMESTAMP) and calling getTimestamp() when the date is outside the year range of 1901 to 2038? Dates inside this year range get correctly the same unix timestamp from both methods.

Duplicate of already fixed issue.

Could somebody please explain to me why this behavioir is correct? Why does getTimestamp() and get(Zend\_Date::TIMESTAMP) return the same unix timestamp when the date is inside the year range of 1901 to 2038, but they return different values when the date is outside this year range?

Running your example code on SVN the following is returned:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    -1643212190
    -1643212190
    -1643212190
    -4798885790
    -4798885790
    -4798885790


As this issue is marked as fixed for the next minor release I don't see a problem as all works like it should.

Ok, so there was a bug. I did not understand that from your first comment. I thougt you sed it SHOULD work like I had reported :) But ok, thanks for this!

You gave the second example at a time where the other issue was already closed for the next minor release. And at night I normally sleep... therefor the delay in the response ;-)
