### Description

When an Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 is created and makes use of the default secret and access keys, the signature is invalid.

Solution: Change line 107: if (!$secret\_key) { $secret\_key = self::$default\_accessKey; }

to

 
       if (!$secret_key) {
            $secret_key = self::$default_secretKey;
        }

This was fixed by ZF-6403 when the base class was moved to use the Abstract Amazon Class.
