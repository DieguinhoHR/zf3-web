ZF-183: Support for HTTP responses that use different linebreaks than CRLF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, the Zend\_Http\_Response code only supports HTTP responses that use CRLF as linebreaks. While the RFC and standards all state that CRLF should be used - some servers break lines with just LF (and possibly just CR ?). Pages from these servers work well in Firefox and other browsers - but completely break with the Zend\_Http\_Client.

Support for servers that end lines with "\\n" is highly recommended.

Resolved in rev. 786

Response class now splits body in a simpler (and faster) way, which also works on "\\n" only line breaks. Headers are split on "\\n" and all remaining "\\r" characters are trimmed automatically.
