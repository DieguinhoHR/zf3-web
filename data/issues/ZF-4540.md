### Description

I will copy here the request from [http://nabble.com/Soap-AutoDiscover-Arrays-of-Objeâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Soap-AutoDiscover-Arrays-of-Objects--td18709067.html#a19913480), because it decribes everything:

Hi all!

First of all I really appreciate the new Soap Autodiscover-feature.

I'm missing one thing, though (tried 1.6 rc1):

I'd like to use arrays of objects.

class MyService { /\*\* \* my class \* \* @return Data[] \*/ public function getArrayOfObjects() { $return = array(); $return[] = new Data(); $return[] = new Data();

 
     return $return;


}

}

class Data { /\*\* \* @var int \* \*/ $dummy = 5; }

$server = new Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover(); $server->setClass( 'Service' );

$server->handle();

Now if I have a look at the generated wsdl, the function getArrayOfObjects just has output "xsd:anyType". If I change "Data[]" to "array", then it becomes "soap-enc:Array". To my mind, it would be nice, to generate a complex type "ArrayOfData":

This way, the PEAR Services/Webservice Class used to generate the wsdl.

Another option could be to generate a container complex type with the inner type set to minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded" to get an array.

I don't think php has any problems accessing a service with an "xsd:any" array, but there are other languages that are much more strict on that point.

Any ideas? Any plans in these directions? greetings,

Nico

This is now fixed in trunk, i cannot change the status to resolved though, since there is a bug in Jira.

There is a new WSDL complex type detection strategy class "Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeComplex" which handles the case of returning Arrays of Objects.
