Fixed in r24389 in SVN.

Please note that this was not a Blocker priority, it was a simple Docblock correction to reflect a param class.

Dear Padraic,

I am happy to see you putting some effort in to this. I am sorry to say you didn't fix the problem

Please observe line 58:

public static function fromReflection(Zend\_Reflection\_Docblock\_Tag $reflectionTagParam)

where it should read:

public static function fromReflection(Zend\_Reflection\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param $reflectionTagParam)

Tested that - it's an inheritance problem because using the Param type hint causes a PHP Strict Standards Warning - so we have to use the Tag class. It's not perfect, but that's what you get for using static methods and inheritance.
