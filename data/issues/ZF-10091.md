### Description

Hi,

I am fairly new to ZF and I am not quite sure this is a "real" bug... But I figured the only way to know for sure is to report about it. When building a url with Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url::simple() it outputs something like this: /<http://sitename.com/>... [with the extra / in front of it]

This is done on line 79 of the script. Now I understand that this is quite useful for relative paths... but this does not work for full URLs right ?

Maybe I am just missing the point here.. Thanks for your explanations in that case

Hi dGo,

this is probably not a bug. Can you provide some code what you've done to reproduce this problem?

Have in mind that simple() only accept these parameters: $action, $controller, $module, $params

So you can't pass a full URI to this method.

regards René

Hi Christoph,

Well, within an action, I need to build an url. I am using the following code:

$url = $this->\_helper->url('send', 'mails', 'admin', array( 'mailId' => $mailId, 'senderName' => urlencode($senderDetails['senderName']), 'senderMail' => $senderDetails['senderMail'], 'adminMail' => $senderDetails['adminMail'] ));

this would output /[http://mysite.com/admin/mails/…](http://mysite.com/admin/mails/send/mailId/%5BID%5D/senderName/%5BSENDERNAME%5D/senderMail%5BSENDERMAIL%5D/adminMail/%5BADMINMAIL)]

with the slash in front of, it which resulted in a wrong URL

Thus, I change line 79 of Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url from $url = '/' . ltrim($url, '/'); into $url = ltrim($url, '/');

this way, the URL is OK.

The reason I think this is a bug is beacause when looking at the function, the URL is build from the baseurl (line 66-68)  
 if ('' !== ($baseUrl = $this->getFrontController()->getBaseUrl())) { $url = $baseUrl . '/' . $url; }

And thus, if the $baseUrl is not empty, the url should not get prefixed with a shlash... Although... I think...

Let me know if I am not clear And thanks a lot !

URL did not come through as I wanted.. should be http: //mysite.com/admin/mails/send/mailId/[ID]/senderName/[SENDERNAME]/senderMail[SENDERMAIL]/adminMail/[ADMINMAIL]
