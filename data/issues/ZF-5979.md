### Description

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable appears to break with 1.7.6.

Example code:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    // Grab information for database.
    $configuration = new Zend_Config_Ini(
        APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/app.ini', 
        APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT
    );
            
    // Set up authentication stuff (credentials to
    // use and how they should be related to DB).
    $this->_auth = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable(
        Zend_Db::factory($configuration->database),
        'user',
        'username',
        'password',
        "MD5( CONCAT ( MD5( ? ) , MD5( salt ) ) )"
    );


...later on...

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $this->_auth->setIdentity($_POST['username'])
         ->setCredential($_POST['password']);
    
    $result = $this->_auth->authenticate();


This worked as expected in version 1.7.5, but after upgrade to 1.7.6, the following error message is received: "The supplied parameters to Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable failed to produce a valid sql statement, please check table and column names for validity."

_Update:_ This error does not occur on my Windows box, but does occur on my OS X box.

Never mind. This has been resolved.
