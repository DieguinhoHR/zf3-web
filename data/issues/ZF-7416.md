### Description

On this page: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.examples.html)

Under section "4.4. Examples"

It says: "Resource plugins implement Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Resource, which defines simply that they allow injection of the caller and options, and that they have an init() method. "

This is wrong. The class 'Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Resource' does not exist.

The sentence should be corrected to read:

"Resource plugins implement Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Resource, which defines simply that they allow injection of the caller and options, and that they have an init() method."

That change would fix the typo error. However, i will suggest an improvement to this sentence with another ZF issue tracker ticket (ZF-7417).

Probabry ,Zend\_Application\_Resource\_ResourceAbstract is more correct, I think
