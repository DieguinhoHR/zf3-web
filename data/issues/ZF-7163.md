### Description

_This code works fine in 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 and is the result of change(s) made in 1.8.2_

_it is possible that other Ec2 components are affected by this same issue!_

My code is simply

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $ebs = new Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2_Ebs('**awskey**', '**secret**'); //values removed for issue post :P
        
    $snapshots = $ebs->describeSnapshot();


I get the error: Request has expired. Expires date is {current date/time UTC}

Stack:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    #0 C:\PHP\includes\ZendFramework-1.8.4-minimal\library\Zend\Service\Amazon\Ec2\Abstract.php(100): Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2_Abstract->checkForErrors(Object(Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2_Response))
    #1 C:\PHP\includes\ZendFramework-1.8.4-minimal\library\Zend\Service\Amazon\Ec2\Ebs.php(299): Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2_Abstract->sendRequest(Array)

I believe this is caused by ZF-7039.

I have fix the signing method to use Timestamp instead of Expires as I believe that was causing the problem with version 2 of the signature method.

it was merged into the release branch with r16392
