### Description

In the docs for ZF 1.8 (and possibly in later versions too):

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.8/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.8/en/zend.layout.advanced.html) (bottom of the page)

It says: {quote} Zend\_Layout Advanced Usage ... Note: Inflection can be disabled ... Simply use the enableInflection() and disableInflection() methods. {quote}

However, if you look at the code, those methods do not exist in the Zend\_Layout class.

Instead, there are two other methods that do modify the $\_inflectorEnabled property:

enableInflector() and disableInflector()

I reckon the line in the docs, at the bottom of the page should be changed from:

bq. Simply use the enableInflection() and disableInflection() methods.

to

bq. Simply use the enableInflector() and disableInflector() methods.

Definitely in version 1.8, possibly in later versions too.
