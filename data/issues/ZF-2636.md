### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element->isValid() check the values unfiltered

since getValue() returns the filtered value, i think the behavior should be that it checks against the filtered value

_Tested on versions:_ Zend Preview 1.5 Zend Snapshot 20080212-7941(this time i did link to the library as well)

_Suggested fixes:_

1 Add a strict option to the method (backwards compatible)
==========================================================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isValid($value, $context = null)
        {
            $this->setValue($value);
            $this->_messages = array();
            $this->_errors   = array();
            $result          = true;
            
            $value = $this->getValue(); //this added line fixes everything
            
            foreach ($this->getValidators() as $validator) {
                if ($validator->isValid($value, $context)) {
                    continue;
                }


2 Add a public function isValidFiltered() in both Zend\_Form and Zend\_Form\_Element applying the above fix
===========================================================================================================

Won't fix.

Validations should happen on the data coming in, prior to filtering; filtering happens _after_ you've ensured the data is safe, and should be done in a way suitable for the usage to which you're putting the data (for instance, you'd filter differently for the database than for rendering to the screen).

To quote Chris Shiflet, "Filter Input, Escape Output". In Zend Framework, Zend\_Validate == "Filter Input", Zend\_Filter == "Escape Output".

It somehow got fixed anyway in 1.5, and needles to say, i'm quite happy with it.

I think the correct behavior should be "Normalize Data, Filter Input, Escape Output" and Normalize data is what the filters are used for now.
