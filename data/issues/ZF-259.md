### Description

when testing my implementation of Zend\_Mail with an smtp transport, i found that the Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp::\_receive method was irregularly throwing an 'Could not read from SMTP server' exception immediately after calling send(). send expects a 250 response, expect calls receive and reads null from the socket, throws an exception caught by \_sendMail() which immediately calls disconnect().

disconnect sends 'QUIT' and expects a 221 response, but instead gets a 250 from the previous SEND. so the problem is that my smtp server takes a few extra ms to respond (only happens after the message is complete). qmail runs the message through spamassassin, clamav, qmail-scanner, procmail, etc.

my proposed solution is to run a loop, with usleep() to give the mail server some extra time to respond. the the response never comes, then throw the exception. after testing, i've never had to sleep more than 100us.

my code below:

protected function \_receive() { $i = 0; do { $res = fgets($this->\_con, 1024); if ($res === false) { if (self::DEBUG) { echo "received NONE, sleep 100us  
\\n"; } usleep(100); } else { break;  
 } } while ($i++ < 10); if ($res === false) { throw new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Exception('Could not read from SMTP server'); } if (self::DEBUG) { echo "R: $res  
\\n"; } return $res; }

Could you please try the latest commit of the subversion (r3168) to see if this resolves the problem? The default timeout was for 2 seconds which was probably too low for your environment

Have fixed according to specs - if this bug reappears then will re-open this issue but otherwise should be completely resolved.
