### Description

Hello,

I have a very strange problem with my batch. It works perfectly when i launch it manually but it stops without any notice, error or exception in the "foreach" when i launch the batch by crontab (i am on Ubuntu).

Algo of my batch: 1째) Get a list of uri from database (Mysql) 2째) Foreach on the uris: 2.1째) Download the file (pdf) from the URI (i use Zend\_Http\_Client to download the file) 2.2째) Insert the pdf file in the database (in binary)

I have try to comment the lines where i download the file (the lines with Zend\_Http\_Client) and i have no more problem with the foreach. So, i think that the problem is cause by the composant Zend\_Http\_Client.

//Initialisation $this->\_httpClient = new Zend\_Http\_Client();

 
        $config = array('maxredirects'    => 5,
                        'timeout' => 10, 
                        'strictredirects' => false,
                        'useragent'       => 'Zend_Http_Client',
                        'keepalive'       => false);
        $this->_httpClient->setConfig($config)


// the request in the foreach $this->\_httpClient->setUri($uri); $response = $this->\_httpClient->request('GET');

Thank you for help and sorry for my very bad english!

I'm closing this as an incomplete because of the lack of an error message.

Please re-run your script, setting error\_reporting to -1, and display\_errors on, so that any errors are caught (and rule out things like timeouts, out of memory etc)

If you have an error message after that, which relates to Zend\_Http\_Client, please re-open, and add further information.
