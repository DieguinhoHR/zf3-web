### Description

I was just developing something wil ACL, not much of a big deal. I got this error at a given moment: Catchable fatal error: Object of class stdClass could not be converted to string in ~/Zend/Acl/Role/Registry.php on line 151

There was no bugtrace, no nothing, just that line. The fact that is says it's catchable, let me to think that it should be catched, or give at least a backtrace, just for developers' sake.

The lines are:

 
    <pre class="highlight">public function has($role)
        {
            if ($role instanceof Zend_Acl_Role_Interface) {
                $roleId = $role->getRoleId();
            } else {
                $roleId = (string) $role;                    // This is the line where it goes wrong
            }
    
            return isset($this->_roles[$roleId]);
        }

Freak (on IRC better known as Freeaqingme).

p.s. Of course I was the one who gave a wrong argument to this function, but I feel like I should have been given some more info.

I think the php error message is sufficient in this case, because you were just misusing the functionality.

What exactly was your intention to pass an arbitrary object to that function?

It should be clear that it only works for classes that extend Zend\_Acl\_Role\_Interface. Maybe it works by implementing the \_\_toString() method in your custom object so that the string cast works.

Obviously, I was misusing the functionality indeed, and I do not blame ZF or anyone else but myself for that. My intention was to use this function properly. The problem was that I was given no clear error, and that is something I would have liked to be different. As said; I don't think there's anything wrong with the method, it would just be appreciated if there's an error thrown so it can be backtraced easily.
