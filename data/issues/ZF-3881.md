### Description

the phpdoc says: "If an element's name is not specified as a key in the array, its value is set to null."

well it doesn't do what it says. I suppose there is a missing else clause in the first if statement of this method, where it should call the setDefault( $name, null ) method to reset the form elements value

this is unless I got something misunderstood.

This behavior was changed for ZF-2735 with r8633, but the phpdoc was never updated.
