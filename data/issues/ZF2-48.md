### Description

see this bug: <http://zendframework.com/issues/browse/ZF-4221>

Was a won't fix because of BC break. Please introduce break :) Instantiating elements with arrays is not elegant. See Configration Objects Thread in zf-contributors.

public function \_\_construct($spec, $options = null) { parent::\_\_construct($spec, $options); $this->setAllowEmpty(true) ->setRequired(true) ->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator(false) ->addValidator($this->getCaptcha(), true); }

As noted in ZF-4221, this cannot be fixed without a BC break. As Zend\\Form for ZF2 is being developed, I'd suggest keeping this issue in mind before ZF2 is finalised as a possible improvement. There is no ETA on Zend\\Form 2.0 for the time being however.
