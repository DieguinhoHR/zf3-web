### Description

I download the english documentation.

Then I open the file /introduction.html in my browser.

If I click now on the link "Programmer's Reference Guide" it opens manual.html which itself is more or less empty.

It worked in 1.10.0 but then it was broken (at least 1.10.3 and 1.10.4)

I really like the offline docs since I do not always have an internet connection.
