ZF-10093: Out of memory when searching an index with the sorting option

### Description

I have an index with 350 documents aproximately, I'm storing the document text for highlighting purpose, seach document has many other fields apart from document text. I'm paginating the results from 10 to 10. Searching the index with a keyword that returns almost every document, without a sorting option, the search finishes well. But when searching with the sorting option it runs out of memory. My memory is set up to 32 mb.

Narrowing the problem it seems to be a problem with the search method of the Zend\_Search\_Lucene. There is a foreach that needs to get all the document hits for the sorting, and it retrieves each Document, and after retrieving the document gets the FieldValue.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($hits as $hit) {
      try {
        $value = $hit->getDocument()->getFieldValue($fieldName);
      } catch (Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception $e) {
      if (strpos($e->getMessage(), 'not found') === false) {
        throw new Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception($e->getMessage(), $e->getCode(), $e);
      } else {
        $value = null;
      }
      $valuesArray[] = $value;
    }


Thanks for the great effort.

Roger
