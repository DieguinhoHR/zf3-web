### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/111>

Documentation of Zend\_Db\_Select refer to bind() method, which seems to be not exists.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
         /**
         * Adds a HAVING condition to the query by AND.
         * [...]
         * Array values are quoted and comma-separated.
         *
         * 
         * // simplest but non-secure
         * $select->having("COUNT(id) = $count");
         *
         * // secure
         * $select->having('COUNT(id) = ?', $count);
         *
         * // equivalent security with named binding
         * $select->having('COUNT(id) = :count');
         * $select->bind('count', $count); // <---
         * 
         * [...]
         */


The same story with where() documentation.

Obviously something was planned for binding values directly into the Select instance, but that was never implemented (maybe abandoned?).

This patch fixes the API docs.

Applied patch from Mislav Marohnic to resolve ZF-105 by simply removing documentation for not-yet-implemented features. See the FishEye link for more information.
