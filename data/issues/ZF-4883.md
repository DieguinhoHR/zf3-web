### Description

The file/class names for the following classes should be spelled with similar capitalization and names:

Zend\_Form\_Element\_Checkbox and Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CheckBox Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit and Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_SubmitButton

As it stands forms containing check boxes need to be edited in order to enable Dojo elements.

These are deliberately named differently. All dijit Zend\_Form elements are spelled to follow the capitalization used within dijit.form, so that there can be a 1:1 relationship between their names and the corresponding dijit.form objects.
