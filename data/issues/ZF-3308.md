### Description

I think there are some "side effects" I don't understand (currently) which are setting self::$\_destroyed of Zend\_Session at something else than a boolean.

I posted on Nabble's forum : [http://nabble.com/Zend\_Session-coupled-with-Zend\_Aâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Session-coupled-with-Zend_Auth-throws-an-exception-in-ZF-%3E1.0.3-td17364322.html#a17401565)

So, I'm not a pretty good developer, but it could be nice to add some code du Zend\_Session, in the start function, at the beginning: if (! is\_bool(self::$\_destroyed) && !empty(self::$\_destroyed) ) { require\_once 'Zend/Session/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Session\_Exception('The session is set as destroyed with the value "'.self::$\_destroyed.'" but has not been explicitly destroyed during this request.'); } //the code below already exists, I've just added the '===true'  
 if (self::$\_sessionStarted && self::$\_destroyed===true) { require\_once 'Zend/Session/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Session\_Exception('The session was explicitly destroyed during this request, attempting to re-start is not allowed.'); }

Is this sill and issue? Also, if so, what is My\_Auth\_Storage\_CustomStorage() doing?

Closing due to lack of response from origin poster.
