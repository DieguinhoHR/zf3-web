### Description

After authenticated on Active Directory using Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap as my adapter, i can call getLdap(), returning the Zend\_Ldap object used to authenticated.

The problem is when I do searches: everytime it's necessary to bind. I don't if this is default or not, but it's so boring.

Wouldn't be nice if there was a "auto-bind" function inside search function? Afterall, The options are already set there, including username and password posted by user.

Please, thanks and sorry in advance if I said something wrong. Im new here and a eternal apprentice. :}
