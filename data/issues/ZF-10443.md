You can already dump log to the screen with the writer _stream_ and the stream _<a>php://output</a>_. What do you bring more? I think that you can not add a new component without making a proposal before.

Matthew has announced that proposals for ZF 1.11 had a deadline to August 31, and ZF 1.11 is currently the last scheduled minor release. The new components are logically frozen for the branch ZF1. It should therefore be seen as the new components compared to the branch ZF2, and its specifications.

This doesn't dump it willy-nilly to the screen as it would with <a>php://output</a>. It puts it into a placeholder so that you can place the whole log on the web page at any place.
