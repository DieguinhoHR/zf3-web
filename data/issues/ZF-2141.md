Fixed by no longer referencing the undefined variable $source. Sending out request for code review to fw-gdata allow for this to be released with the next release.

_Review for r6732:_

I don't see anything wrong with the changes made. Feel free to merge this into release-1.0.

However, is there a reason that getHttpClient() isn't being called anywhere here? This looks like the sort of thing that could have easily been caught with a unit test.

Thanks for the review Trevor.

Agreed that getHttpClient could be called to generate the header and avoid duplicate code (in this method and others). Filed as <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2145>.

Yes, it could be caught in a unit test, if we used mock HTTP client classes, but we haven't used those yet for Zend\_Gdata. Filed as: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2146>

While mock HTTP clients would certainly be nice, in this case we just would have had to check that getHttpClient() is returning a properly instantiated instance of Zend\_Http\_Client.

Gotcha, I thought you were mentioning that we needed testing on AuthSubRevokeToken(sic), which couldn't be tested fully without a mock client. Testing getHttpClient can be tested, and would have caught this problem (as you pointed out) if we were using getHttpClient in the other methods.

Thanks Trevor! -Ryan
