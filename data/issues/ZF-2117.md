There is more information about this tool somewhere ? It's link with the project primitus ?

I work for Ausy (Zend partner Belgium and Luxemburg) and we have the same project.

This is the main issue for the first version of the main Zend Framework project's code generation facilities. There is no more information as a proposal has yet to be put together, and the only link with the Primitus project is that it is one of the inspirations for this tool. Stay tuned for a proposal, which will be linked to from this issue.

Reassigning to Ralph as he's taken over development of this component.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Looks like this issue was resolved by implementing Zend\_CodeGenerator unless I am missing something.
