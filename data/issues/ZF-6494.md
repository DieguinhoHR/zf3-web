### Description

I created a custom filter called ToDate wich returns a Zend\_Date object. So, i'm using this after validating a date field with Zend\_Validate\_Date. Thus, i can apply custom date validators on it and, finally, convert to 'yyyy-mm-dd' format in order to save the row object in database. But when i call Zend\_Filter\_Input::getEscaped(), i get a date string, because defaultEscapeFilter is applied on the value in \_escapeRecursive(). I think the correction in Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_escapeRecursive() is quite simple:

change:

 
        if (!is_array($data)) {
            return $this->_getDefaultEscapeFilter()->filter($data);
        }


to: if (!is\_array($data) && !is\_object($data)) { return $this->\_getDefaultEscapeFilter()->filter($data); }

This would not work.

Your change would force objects to be run through the foreach loop which causes a warning as objects are casted to string. And the API of getEscaped() declares that the input value has to be a string and not a object.

Using this I would simply define a own Default Filter which accepts and returns objects.

Additionally I would not know how escaping of a object should work. Escaping can only be applied to a string. Therefor a casting is expected behaviour.

Closing this issue as Won't Fix after a short discussion with the dev-team.

Reason: getEscaped() escapes data which is intended for usage within the View. This method does not handle non native types. What should be escaped within an object? It would be casted to an string in any case.

Therefor there is no solution for the described case. You would have to extend the needed classes to provide the methodology you wish.
