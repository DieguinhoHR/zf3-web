### Description

receive is never called when the form is valid.

if ($form->isValid($formData)) { if(file\_exist($form->file->getFileName()) { //received has been called } // received not called // some methods to fire the receive() // $file = $form->getValue('file'); // or $form->file->receive(); }

At least please write this in the documentation.
