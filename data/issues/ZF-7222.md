### Description

It would be useful to be able to pass an array of decorators (or indeed, options) to the individual radio buttons making up a Radio element. Perhaps treating each radio button as it's own element would allow this, with Form\_Element\_Radio instantiating each button element and passing it options.

My motivation for suggesting this is that my designer has requested radio layout like:

The standard radio elements enforce layout like .

In order to achieve the altered layout, I've had to subclass Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_RadioButton, Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_RadioButton, Zend\_Form\_Element\_Radio, and Zend\_View\_Helper\_Radio, all of which are essentially cut-and-paste copies of the original's render method with a line or two altered.

I also think it could clean the code up a lot to handle radios with their own decorators.

Hi Matthew,

Does it currently exist a way to reach this goal (ability to apply decorators to each option) ? If there is an alternative way that could be great to know it, by waiting an improvement which will be simpler to use.

Thanks
