ZF-7522: Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream opens files unnecessarily
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When I use Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream to write to file, the file is opened even though no data is actually written to the log. It would save unnecessary filesystem accesses if the file would be opened only in case something is actually written (e.g. on the first write).
