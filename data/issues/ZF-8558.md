ZF-8558: Backward incompatible change in rev 19661
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-16T11:10:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-13T06:26:52.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

Let me try to explain it with some code:

Application dispatching:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    try {
       $front->dispatch();
    } catch (My_Controller_Outcome_Result $e) {
       $front->getResponse()->sendResponse();
       // Ignore
    }


My\_Controller\_Outcome\_Result exceptions (thrown somewhere in actions) usually indicate a redirect (or other event that should stop the execution)

Prior to 19661 I was actually getting a My\_Controller\_Outcome\_Result exception, but after that the instance is Zend\_Controller\_Exception, so the catch fails.

I managed to locate the change in ZF rev 19661 (trunk).

I _really_ hope this gets fixed soon. I don't know how we're supposed to try/catch our own code if the Zend Framework now only throws Zend\_Controller\_Exception for everything that's thrown out of the code.

Resolved in trunk.

The same pattern is used in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard, line 301. Can that be fixed as well? (r19833 fixed only Zend\_Controller\_Front)

Fixed in r20244 in trunk.

The same thing is happening in various places in Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Broker as well. :)

Verified; will remove those wrapped exceptions shortly.

Plugin broker no longer wraps re-thrown exceptions in trunk.

Everything seems fine now. Thank you! :)
