### Description

Example URL scheme: index.php?controller=archive&action=show&year=2006

It's a simple change to the code in the Request\_Abstract in getControllerName and getActionName methods which instead of getting the names out of Request getParams should use plain get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getControllerName()
        {
    -        return $this->getParam($this->getControllerKey());
    +        return $this->get($this->getControllerKey());
        }


Any artificially programmer created request parameters (like for example by the router or in the application plugins) should override normal user submitted ones (GET, POST, etc). So we make the modification to Request Http \_\_get method to include those parameters. Since they are supposed to override anything else, we have to place them in the front:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __get($key) 
        { 
            switch (true) {
    +            case isset($this->_params[$key]):
    +                return $this->_params[$key];
                case isset($_GET[$key]):
                    return $_GET[$key];
                case isset($_POST[$key]):
                    return $_POST[$key];
                case isset($_COOKIE[$key]):
                    return $_COOKIE[$key];

The original issue was resolved with revision 1820, when Zend\_Http\_Request was moved into Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http, as getControllerName() proxies to getParam(), and the latter method checks in the $\_GET and $\_POST arrays if the parameter is not in the user params.

The secondary issue of the \_\_get() functionality was resolved in revision 1900 (w00t! revision 1900!).
