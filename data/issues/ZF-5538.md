Alex, what is the status of the online API docs for ZendX components? It seems like this should be fixed with the next website build.

The APIDOC is still missing the ZendX components.

Fixed since version 1.7.

Where is it?

Here is nothing: [<http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core>] [<http://framework.zend.com/docs/api>]

The same for the download packages.
