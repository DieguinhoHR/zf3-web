ZF-6959: Zend\_CodeGenerator breaks ZF coding style rules when generate code

### Description

When zf.sh (zf.bat) generates new source files it breaks some coding style rules.

It uses PHP\_EOL as line termination sequence, so using windows version of PHP causes ZF non-compatible code (cite: Line termination follows the Unix text file convention.) Maybe would be better to use unix-like line termintaion or use some setting to specify which line-end symbol to use. Many developers use ZF coding style and zf codegenerator breaks it.
