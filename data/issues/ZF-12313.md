### Description

Hello,

I installed Zend Guard Loader (Runtime for PHP 5.3.x) 5.5.0 (64 bit) on my server. I just use it in combination with my apache webserver, because I need it for some moduls of a shop software.

- Scripts that are using the guard loader produces segmentation faults in the apache error log like this including crashes after a while:

[notice] child pid 2730 exit signal Segmentation fault (11) [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down [notice] seg fault or similar nasty error detected in the parent process

- The simple "php -v -c /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini" produces the follwing output including segmentation fault:

PHP 5.3.14-1~dotdeb.0 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jun 20 2012 23:21:52) Copyright (c) 1997-2012 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2012 Zend Technologies with XCache v2.0.0, Copyright (c) 2005-2012, by mOo with Xdebug v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 2002-2012, by Derick Rethans with Zend Guard Loader v3.3, Copyright (c) 1998-2010, by Zend Technologies with Suhosin v0.9.33, Copyright (c) 2007-2012, by SektionEins GmbH Segmentation fault

Closing this issue as it relates to Zend Guard, and not Zend Framework.
