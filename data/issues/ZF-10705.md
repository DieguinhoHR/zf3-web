ZF-10705: Unable to use with php 5.1.6-27.el5

### Description

Fatal error: Call to undefined function spl\_object\_hash()..

This because spl\_object\_hash is supported on 5.2 +.

My web server is using 5.1.6-27. It appears difficult to get the server upgraded. Can you suggest a simple way of getting around this. I am unable to deploy my application.

That's why Zend Framework requires PHP 5.2.4+ to work correctly.

See here: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.introduction.html)

Maybe, it's possible for you to use PHP with CGI. <http://php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php>.

Please ask on this Issue on IRC or the mailing list.

This issue does not affect the Zend Framework as is.

Closing as not an issue.

The minimal requirements for Zend Framework are detailed here [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.introduction.html)

Please submit support requests to the fw-general mailing list, or in #zftalk on freenode IRC

You can use this work around:

if (!function\_exists('spl\_object\_hash')) { /\*\* \* Returns the hash of the unique identifier for the object. \* \* @param object $object \* @author Andreas Rein \* @return string \*/ function spl\_object\_hash($object) { if (is\_object($object)) { return md5((string)$object); } trigger\_error(**FUNCTION** . "() expects parameter 1 to be object", E\_USER\_WARNING); return null; } }
