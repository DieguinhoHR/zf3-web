ZF-9585: fifth parameter of php mail() function used with an empty string in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When using _resources.mail.transport.type = sendmail_ in _application.ini_ , _Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail::\_sendMail()_ detects _$this->parameters_ as en empty string instead of _null_, (line 101). So, php mail() function is used with a fifth parameter (line 126) that contains an empty string. It's a problem as this fifth parameter seems to be forbiden in safe mode.

A workaround is not to use _resources.mail.transport.type = sendmail_ in _application.ini_ as _sendmail_ is the default transport anyway.

Thanks

Please note that using sendmail is not advised in real applications, and that the SMTP adapter is much better to use.

As to what the issue itself is concerned; after a short confabulation on IRC we decided not to fix this issue for the simple reason that we don't want to start writing work-arounds throughout the entire framework in order to support unsupported installations. If we started doing so, the next person wants us to support php5.1 and within a couple of weeks we'll be flooded with questions to please do support php4, and if we wait long enough, I'm pretty sure some people will start wondering why we can't support php3 just as well.

Using Safe Mode really is a bad behavior since it is security through obscurity (hence it's been officially deprecated as of php5.3, and will be removed as of php6). Therefore, I'd like you to advise to switch hosts, and if that's not possible, just stick with the smtp adapter.
