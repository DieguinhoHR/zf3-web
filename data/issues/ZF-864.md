### Description

If I create the index with Apache Lucene 1.9 I can not open the the index with your framework:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    exception 'Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception' with message 'Largest supported segment size (for 32-bit mode) is 2Gb' in
    :\workspace\GIATA\FlipCat-Vts\library\ZendFramework-trunk\library\Zend\Search\Lucene\Storage\File.php:215
    Stack trace:
    #0 D:\workspace\GIATA\FlipCat-Vts\library\ZendFramework-trunk\library\Zend\Search\Lucene.php(211): Zend_Search_Lucene_Storage_File->readLong()
    #1 D:\workspace\GIATA\FlipCat-Vts\search.php(22): Zend_Search_Lucene->__construct('./toptermindex')
    #2 {main}


Filename: ./toptermindex/segments Filesize: 30 System: Win32

The following information I have found:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fields
    
    
    Field Info
    
    Field names are stored in the field info file, with suffix .fnm.
    
    FieldInfos (.fnm) --> FieldsCount,  FieldsCount
    
    FieldsCount --> VInt
    
    FieldName --> String
    
    FieldBits --> Byte
    
        * The low-order bit is one for indexed fields, and zero for non-indexed fields.
        * The second lowest-order bit is one for fields that have term vectors stored, and zero for fields without term vectors.
    
          Lucene >= 1.9:
        * If the third lowest-order bit is set (0x04), term positions are stored with the term vectors.
        * If the fourth lowest-order bit is set (0x08), term offsets are stored with the term vectors.
        * If the fifth lowest-order bit is set (0x10), norms are omitted for the indexed field.
    
    Fields are numbered by their order in this file. Thus field zero is the first field in the file, field one the next, and so on.
    Note that, like document numbers, field numbers are segment relative.

Please give a list of index directory with file size. Is any of index file greater than 2Gb?

In the attachment is my created index and the script to read this index using ZF.

The index is very small

Fixed.

The problem was caused by large index version numbers (Java Lucene uses current time in milliseconds to initialize index version).

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
