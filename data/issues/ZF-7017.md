ZF-7017: Params from an ini config file are ignored due to wrong format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If the params for reCaptcha are set in a ini-config-file, then the values are returned as strings (boolean value are actually required), which is a problem during varification in Zend\_Service\_ReCaptcha::getHtml() in:

if ($this->\_params['ssl'] === true) { ...

and

if ($this->\_params['xhtml'] === true) { ...
