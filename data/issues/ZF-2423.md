### Description

When "make check" English documents, it would show some error messages that some documents did not follow the DTD rules.

Here is one example:

Issue this command:

make XMLFILE=Zend\_Currency-Useage.xml check1

It would get
------------

\_temp\_Zend\_Currency-Useage.xml:54: element example: validity error : Element example content does not follow the DTD, expecting (blockinfo? , (title , titleabbrev?) , (calloutlist | glosslist | bibliolist | itemizedlist | orderedlist | segmentedlist | simplelist | variablelist | literallayout | programlisting | programlistingco | screen | screenco | screenshot | synopsis | cmdsynopsis | funcsynopsis | classsynopsis | fieldsynopsis | constructorsynopsis | destructorsynopsis | methodsynopsis | formalpara | para | simpara | address | blockquote | graphic | graphicco | mediaobject | mediaobjectco | informalequation | informalexample | informalfigure | informaltable | indexterm | beginpage | procedure)+), got (title para programlisting note )

When I moved tag out of the tag, this error message had gone.

To follow DTD rules, I suggest all concerned developers use

make XMLFILE="Zend\_Xxxx-Yyyy.xml" check1

command to check the documents you are working on and fix the non-compliance problem in the documents.

Pretty sure there was a 'not' missing from the title. :)

darby, can you fix these docs for the 1.0.4 release or delegate to someone in the community? Do we know if these were the cause of the segfaults in building the docs somehow?

Thanks Wil for correcting my English mistake.

Darby,

I am working on a shell script that can move all tags out of tags and put them right after the closed tag.

Not finished yet, but will be ok soon.

If you need, I can do this part.

Jason.

@[~wil]: Having a list of the affected files would be a good start toward resolving the issue. I don't know of any evidence that this specific non-compliance with DocBook DTD is responsible for the segfault I have experienced when trying to build the Simplified Chinese documentation. Actually, I think it is not related, since this issue applies to the English "master" documentation, and, as far as I know, Simplified Chinese is the only language for which the build segfaults.

@[~jason qi]: Excellent, I thank you and look forward to seeing the developments! :)

There are only two files did not follow this rule.

Zend\_Currency-Useage.xml and Zend\_View-Helpers-Partial.xml

However, there are still many other non-compliance with DocBook DTD rules, I think it is better for me to create another issue to list them.
