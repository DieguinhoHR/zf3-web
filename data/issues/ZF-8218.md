ZF-8218: remove unnecessary requirements from Zend\_Service\_Twitter constructor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-11-04T10:11:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-20T07:33:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.6 (24/Nov/09)

### Description

There are cases where Zend\_Service\_Twitter can be used without authentication, but the constructor requires $username and $password to always be passed. For example, checking if a given username exists or not:

$tw = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter(null); $exists = $tw->user->show($who)->id() !== null;

Since the first parameter is required, one can't simply do this:

$tw = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter();

I'd like to propose that both constructor parameters should be optional, in order to more cleanly support these anonymous uses.
