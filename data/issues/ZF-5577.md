---------------------------------------------------

### Description

A grep on the root of the Zend directory shows that Zend\_Http\_Client and its Test and Socket adapter classes and Interface adapter interface are among a small few components that do not currently support receiving a Zend\_Config instance via their setConfig methods. This capability should be as simple as adding a check similar to the following and updating docblocks accordingly.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($config instanceof Zend_Config) {
        $config = $config->toArray();
    } elseif (!is_array($config) {
        // ...
    }

Partially implemented in rev. 17027 - still need to implement on Adapters
