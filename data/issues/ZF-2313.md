---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Front.php has the following lines of code on the top instead of conditionally requiring them in dispatch():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /** Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_ViewRenderer */
    require_once 'Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php';
    
    /** Zend_Controller_Plugin_ErrorHandler */
    require_once 'Zend/Controller/Plugin/ErrorHandler.php';


For those who don't use ViewRenderer and ErrorHandler, these files still get included on each page-load unless they are moved into dispatch() to require them conditionally.
