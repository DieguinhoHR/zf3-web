### Description

According to the docs for the fetchColumn() method in the abstract Zend\_Db\_Statement, it will return a value, or false if there is no value to return.

All child classes either inherit this method, or if they override it (eg. in Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo), they retain the same behaviour: If there are no more rows in the result set, return FALSE.

However, Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle behaves differently. If there are no more rows in the result set, it throws a Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle\_Exception. This inconsistency makes it impossible to write code that is database-independent.

The problem also affects Adapter::fetchOne(), which internally calls Statement::fetchColumn() to do its work.
