ZF-9307: Zend\_Rest\_Client fails to clean-up arg1 
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-02T14:45:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-07-21T09:14:35.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When using named arguments Zend\_Rest\_Client adds an additional argument named arg1 to the call.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Rest_Client('<a href="http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/">http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/</a>');
    $client->method('flickr.auth.getFrob');
    $client->api_key('3dc5df007ff96b1ceb7870ffe45eafc0');
    $client->api_sig($api_sig);
    
    $result = $client->get();


Here's the relevant part of the var\_dump($client)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    object(Zend_Rest_Client)#2 (2) { ["_data:protected"]=>  array(4) { ["method"]=>  string(19) "flickr.auth.getFrob" ["arg1"]=>  string(19) "flickr.auth.getFrob" ["api_key"]=>  string(32) "3dc5df007ff96b1ceb7870ffe45eafc0" ["api_sig"]=>  string(32) "5292b6ecbb8a907e689f36d55697572c" }


As you can see; method is duplicated as arg1; which breaks the flicker call because it's sending [http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/…](http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.auth.getFrob&api_key=3dc5df007ff96b1ceb7870ffe45eafc0&api_sig=5292b6ecbb8a907e689f36d55697572c&arg1=flickr.auth.getFrob) instead of [http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/…](http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.auth.getFrob&api_key=3dc5df007ff96b1ceb7870ffe45eafc0&api_sig=5292b6ecbb8a907e689f36d55697572c).

Updating this as it is still an issue in 1.10.4.

This there an update? This seems to still be an issue in 1.10.3 . Thanks!

Attached is a patch which will resolve this issue and produce the expected behavior. It will also throw Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Exceptions in cases where incorrect usage would result in unexpected behavior.

The \_\_call method on the client that allows consumers to use fluent syntax can produce unexpected behavior because of the variety of conditions that it handles, which is the cause for most of the defects I see related to this class.

For the most reliable results, I recommend using the declared rest methods.

The boxed Warning at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.rest.client.html):

"Any REST service that is strict about the arguments it receives will likely fail using Zend\_Rest\_Client, because of the behavior described above. This is not a common practice and should not cause problems."

Is misleading as it IS a problem with _some_ servers. Like the case reported in this bug, I have a similar issue when trying to use "waterservices.usgs.gov."

While I can understand the desire to make Zend\_Rest\_Client work easily with Zend\_Rest\_Server, most servers are not of this type and may object.

I would suggest adding a flag for STRICT operation. Whether the default should be enabled or disabled is up for argument. My vote would be 'enabled.'

We found the same issue to be true. It can be easily solved by creating your own class that inherits from Zend\_Rest\_Client and override \_\_call. That way you can also return different content-types than XML.
