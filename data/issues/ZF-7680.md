### Description

The appended patch adds support of the two social graph methods [friends/ids](http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-friends%C2%A0ids) and [followers/ids](http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-followers%C2%A0ids) to Zend\_Service\_Twitter. I have not attached any test cases.
