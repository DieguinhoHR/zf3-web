ZF-6834: Nested partial loops modify parent partialCounter
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-28T02:59:20.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:05.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When a partial view file is called from a master view, and itself calls another partial loop, the child partial loop overwrites the parent's partial loop counter.

master.phtml:

$this->partialLoop('\_parent.phtml', $parents);

\_parent.phtml:

$this->partialLoop('\_child.phtml', $this->children); $this->partialCounter; // returns count($this->children) + 1 instead of consecutive values for each parent

I have created a patch for this issue - a test case exposing the bug and a solution.
