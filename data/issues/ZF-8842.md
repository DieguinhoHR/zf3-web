### Description

Zend\_Serializer::factory() makes a call to Reflection to make a check for implemented interfaces of the adapter class.

Reflection calls are known to be PHP greedy, and this one could be avoided.

2 solutions suggested : - Create an instance of the adapter class, then use instanceof operator to check if it implements an interface - use PHP::class\_implements() which avoid any object instanciation but require an in\_array() search.

On creating an instance it will execute code (constructor) of the unchecked class.
