### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::setHeader($name, $value, $replace = false) method

This function implemented in such way that even if $replace set to false a new header is appended to the $\_headers array. Suppose I already set 'Content-Type' header once and then want to set it in the end if no such header was set... I specify $replace as false, but in the result last added header had set.

This is the intended behavior, and it mirrors the same functionality provided in PHP's header function. See this excerpt from <http://php.net/header>

bq. The optional replace parameter indicates whether the header should replace a previous similar header, or add a second header of the same type. By default it will replace, but if you pass in FALSE as the second argument you can force multiple headers of the same type.

That $replace flag essentially acts only to prevent duplicates of single-use headers by overwriting any existing headers of the same type. If no existing header of the type exists, then it will append a new one.
