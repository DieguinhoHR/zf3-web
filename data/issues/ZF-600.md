### Description

(Incubator, revision 1881) The IIS 5.0 doesn't have a rewrite mechanism, but it can deal with PATHINFO. Also there is no REQUEST\_URI in $\_SERVER. But there is an ORIG\_PATH\_INFO that could be combined with QUERY\_STRING to get the same information as in REQUEST\_URI. To get Zend Framework to work with IIS I had to change Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setRequestUri()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setRequestUri($requestUri = null)
    {
        if ($requestUri === null) {
            if (isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
                $requestUri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
            } elseif (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REWRITE_URL'])) {
                $requestUri = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REWRITE_URL'];
            } elseif (isset($_SERVER['ORIG_PATH_INFO'])) { // IIS 5.0, PHP as CGI
                $requestUri = $_SERVER['ORIG_PATH_INFO'];
                if (!empty($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])) {
                    $requestUri .= '?' . $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];
                }
            } else {
                return $this;
            }
        ...


Example for a bootstrap file index.php to handle example.com/index.php/controller/action

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $controller->setControllerDirectory(MY_CONTROLLERS_PATH);
    
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
    $request->setBaseUrl();
    
    $response = $controller->dispatch($request);
    echo $response;

RewriteRouter isn't necessary.

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.
