### Description

At least I assume this is a bug. Maybe there's something inherently bad about the lastBuildDate element? Here's a patch for Zend/Feed/Rss.php in version 1.5.2. This line is missing going back at least as far as version 1.0.3.

    +       $channel->appendChild($lastBuildDate);
        }

You HAVE to attach Unittests to such bugfixes Yoshida. Have you run the testsuite to check that everything still works?

Oh, Sorry for not attaching unittests. It causes BC?
