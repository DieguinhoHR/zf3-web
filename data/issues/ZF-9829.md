### Description

I am having some troubles using Zend Framework v1.10.4. Maybe there is a reason for Zend\_Locale::getTranslation() working the way it does, but I did not find more information about it (e.g. in the manual).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'country', 'en')); //Expected: "Netherlands". Output: "Netherlands"
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'country', 'en_US')); //Expected: "Netherlands". Output: false
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'country', 'nl')); //Expected: "Nederland". Output: false
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslationList('territory', 'en_US', 2)); //returns a correct list with en_US translated country names
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslationList('territory', 'nl', 2)); //returns a correct list with nl_NL translated country names
                
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'language', 'en')); //Expected: "Dutch". Output: "Dutch"
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'language', 'en_GB')); //Expected: "Dutch". Output: "Dutch"
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'language', 'en_US')); //Expected: "Dutch". Output: false
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'language', 'nl')); //Expected: "Nederlands". Output: "Nederlands"
    Zend_Debug::dump(Zend_Locale::getTranslationList('language', 'en_US')); //returns a correct list with translated language names (including "Dutch" where the getTranslation(.. 'en_US') returns false

Could you explain where you see a problem?

When a dialect does not have a translation then no output is returned. Lists on the other hand are according to CLDR rules created by rerouting.

Ok, but how to get e.g. "Nederlands" for country "nl" (localized translation for The Netherlands?

I can image that "false" is returned if the dialect has no translation, but what is the interface then to get a localized translation for a country or language? It is inefficient to get the list and then filter the needed translation.

Am I not aware of other interfaces / classes to do this? Or can this method/class be enhanced with this functionality?

Normally you use the language instead of the fully qualified locale when you have only language informations unrelated from an region.

Yes, but if the translations are available then why is there not an interface to it?

Also, in the following example the language "nl" is used instead of a specific locale/dialect (like nl\_BE) but it still returns "false": ```

If this is net yet available then I would suggest creating a new method for such functionality or maybe giving a parameter to the getTranslation() method to get the translation with some kind of "fallback" mechanism.

There is an interface to it. Use the method "getTranslation()" properly.

I see no problem on the interface.

You are requesting the language "nl" and expect it to be a country. Of course this returns "false" as a language is no country.

Same for your first example. Even on this: Zend\_Debug::dump(Zend\_Locale::getTranslation('nl', 'country', 'en')); I get false because you are using language instead of country. Note: Doing such tests you should always disable the cache else you will have unexpected results.

Ok maybe I can state it differently then. The country 'nl' would be "The Netherlands" or "Nederland" in Dutch. The language for 'nl' would be "Dutch" or "Nederlands".

How can I use Zend\_Locale to get the localized/translated country name, as the depricated method getCountryTranslation() should do if I am correct? My goals is to get country names translated, e.g. "Nederland" or "Amerika". How should the interface be used in this situation?

As you said:

"nl" is the language. "nl" is not the country. Look at the output of getTranslationList... you will see that you have "NL" returned and not "nl". Using full qualified locales you will also have "nl\_NL" in return and not "nl-nl".

So to explain it once again as you did not understand: getTranslation('nl', 'country', 'en') does not work.

You request the language "nl" but want it as detail from the country list using the language "en" as translation. There is no language "nl" as a language is no country.

You can eighter call getTranslation('nl', 'language', 'en'); to get a translation for the language "nl".

Or you can call getTranslation('NL', 'territory', 'en'); to get a translation for the territory/country "NL".

Closing as non-issue
