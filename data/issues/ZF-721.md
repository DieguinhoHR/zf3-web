ZF-721: RFC822 Dates are not localized or GMT, and GMT RFC 822 dates are rejected by setArpa()

### Description

When I try code like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('de_AT');
    $date = new Zend_Date(false,false,false,$locale);
    echo $date->get(Zend_Date::RFC_822);
    
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('en_US');
    $date = new Zend_Date(false,false,false,$locale);
    echo $date->get(Zend_Date::RFC_822);


I get exactly the same output, with the timezone localized to Europe (GMT +01:00).

I see code like the following in the unit tests:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = $date->setArpa('Sat, 03 May 01 00:00:00 +0100');
    $this->assertSame($result->get(Zend_Date::RFC_822),'Thu, 03 May 01 01:00:00 +0200');


I don't understand the second line of code. If we set a particular date, and then fetch it, shouldn't the result be identical to what was just previously set?

I think we should either produce dates with a GMT zone, or at least with a zone offset corresponding to the local time() using something like \_gmtDifference().

<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/#z28> - BNF

We are in a Web environment, so I would expect RFC 822 dates to resemble something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Date: Fri, 05 Jan 2007 03:35:53 GMT


by default.

I am still undecided about the value of having RFC 822 dates with a zone component localized to the timezone identified by the \_Locale property of an instance of Zend\_Date. Accurately determining a timezone for a particular locale seems nearly impossible, since many locales have multiple timezones.

However, determining the time offset using: ```

seems reliable, although the server's local time might not be the timezone desired by the developer and might not be related to the \_Locale property of any particular instance of Zend\_Date.

Having a look at the specification <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt> at page 25 you see the specification of the RFC 822 date.

And the timezone offset is explicitly specified... it's also returned by PHP when you use date(DATE\_RFC822); Even some browsers return a timezone difference instead of GMT.

The locale itself is not given for determinating the timezone offset... it's passed for the new date object to set the locale of this object. So you can extract a localized date of a RFC date for example.

related to this code     $result = $date->setArpa('Sat, 03 May 01 00:00:00 +0100');
    $this->assertSame($result->get(Zend_Date::RFC_822),'Thu, 03 May 01 01:00:00 +0200');

In general this date would be false... because the 03.May 2001 is a thursday and not a saturday... also the timezone offset of 1 hour is wrong, because we have summertime at this date... so +1 becomes +2. setArpa uses the timezone which is set for the script. You can set your timezone offset with php.ini, by using date\_timezone\_set or by using Zend\_Date->setTimeZone.

And the timezone for all tests is set to Europe/Paris.

The input is only fixed, otherwise we would have to throw an exception because the date is illegal.

Btw: The timezone offset is sometimes usefull... so you can determinate where in the world a user is located... some will set a different language, but noone will set a different timezone for his client ;-)

Also to mention:

The RFC\_822 parameter was included because of PHP's new date constant DATE\_RFC822

But PHP does also not produce RFC conform output.

setting the timezone to Europe/Paris produces a timezone setting of CET for date(DATE\_RFC822);

But CET is not supported by RFC 822...

On the other side +0000 as Zend\_Date produces it, is supported by RFC 822... The question now is how we should behave.

Parsing input RFC conform, or behave like PHP ??

I delay this issue to 0.8 because we need to clarify this with the PHP developer team.

Work has been stopped until response from PHP devteam related to PHP itself not RFC 822 conform

Fixed with SVN 3190 for the I18N branch.

Remember:

PHP itself gives wrong otput for DATE\_RFC822 until PHP 5.2.2. So PHP's and the frameworks outputs are not equal... the Framework outputs the correct RFC822 string.
