### Description

Currently it is quite complicated to access the cache manager from the model or the view. Maybe we should consider making the cache manager a singleton?

The cache manager is stored in the frontcontroller after you set it up through zend\_app. The frontcontroller happens to be a singleton already: Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap')->getResource('cachemanager');

Singletons are incredibly tricky to test against, and lead to undocumented dependencies and unexpected side-effects. For this reason, we have already mandated that in 2.0, we will not use singletons except for resources that are truly singular in nature (e.g., the autoloader).

We will _not_ add any more singletons between now and then.

Just to echo Matthew - singletons tend to ask for trouble. On the concept that the class instance is hard to retrieve, if you need to force it into a singleton style, use Zend\_Registry to store it. This is cleaner than even using the FrontController access method Dolf describes since there's no guarantee the FrontController will always be a singleton itself. You can do this from your Bootstrap with a custom Resource method (just make sure the custom method pre-checks that the Cachemanager resource is bootstrapped).

Thank you for your comments. I was aware that you can fetch the cache manager from the front controller, but it looks kinda clumsy.

A will close this issue, but regarding your comment Pádraic, I do believe that there should be an option for all of the stock resources to register the resource in the registry automatically. But this a story for another issue or the mailing list.
