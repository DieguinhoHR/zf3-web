ZF-3507: Missing support for loading XML files directly without going through Zend\_Http\_Client (as well as redundant parsing of DOM)

### Description

Currently there is no way to use DOM to directly parse an URL. Instead everything is first forced through Zend\_Http\_Client, which adds overhead and does not leverage the DOM internal magic to handle different encoding types.

Furthermore the DOM is parse once to determine the feed type and then again when the actual parsing takes place.

patch that solves the two notes issues

Patch introduces a backwards compatibility break by altering the client use. Also, in reality the HTTP client is a more flexible solution (with the obvious perf cost) enabling the even more perf enhancing boost of conditional requests. Since on aggregate the changes would shift the balance to a short term perf enhancement at the cost of that flexibility, the patch will not be applied at this time.

The OP may re-open the issue however (given the age) if they wish to persue a more balanced solution.

the issue is that using the DOM object directly for loading enables lots of automatic encoding magic that is not available otherwise. this is especially useful when having to deal with (malformed/malencoded) RSS feeds.

Understood - but regardless it breaks BC, and prevents conditional caching. The patch as is cannot address those points. Given the status of Zend\_Feed, the best I can do is revisit it in Zend Framework 2.0 for Zend\_Feed\_Reader and see if the DOM magic can be integrated without sacrificing flexibility.
