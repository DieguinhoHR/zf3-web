Out of curiosity, what would be a usecase that comes to mind? Especially since one can add 3 months instead...

but this component has addYear, not addMonth(12)...

Both examples are useless.

We are not reproducing Symphony. And we will not only use addSecond() and erase addYear, addMonth, addDay, addHour and so on, only because every timepart can be broken into seconds.

Note: Quarter is not always 3 months.
