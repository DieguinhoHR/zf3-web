### Description

The expounds on ZF-10898. ZF-10898 was meant to allow Zend\_Application to honor application.\*.dist if requested; however, a discussion on IRC (#zftalk w/ darkangel) illuminated some confusion.

This announcement: [http://devzone.zend.com/article/â€¦](http://devzone.zend.com/article/13643-Zend-Framework-1.11.5-Released) mentioned the following:

This allows you to create the following:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    application/
        configs/
            application.ini.dist


and, while still specifying application.ini as the configuration file, fall back to the .dist variant.

The wording above alludes to the fact that Zend\_Application might auto-choose the .dist variant. While this is a completely valid request, it wasn't the original intent of the enhancement.

This issue is being opened in order to iterate over this further enhancement as it is a valid and useful request.

NOTE: <https://gist.github.com/937433> (the original way I intended to use the feature)
