### Description

It seems that the NumbersSpinner issue might be a dojo-issue, I've posted this ticket: <http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/9643>

This leaves the issue with the dojo form not being connected to the form when using Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo::setUseProgrammatic();

I've debugged and found the cause being that the form can't be without an id or name attrib:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


The error is due to this part: _{"id":null,"params":{"dojoType":"dijit.form.Form"_. The id cannot be null since the dojo.byId then can't find the form.

My suggestion is to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getName(){
            $name = parent::getName();
            if($name === null){
                $name = __CLASS__ . "_timestamp_" .time();
            }
            return $name;
        }


The alternative is to throw an exception or warning when not providing a Zend\_Dojo\_Form with an id or name. Another possibility that applies to my specific code is to use the ini-file data as name of the form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    demo.test_element_form.method = "post"
    demo.test_element_form.class = "zend_form"


Where the form name obviously is "test\_element\_form".

Original bug report: A Zend\_Dojo\_Form isn't submittable if a NumberSpinner element is set to null, pressing the submit button gives no response. After some searching I found this comment on Dojo's homepage about the required vale that explains this odd behavior: ??Defaults to true in NumberSpinner because the arrows won't work otherwise.??

See [http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/â€¦](http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-2-dijit/form-validation-specialized-input/number-spinner) for details

Suggestion: - _Improve doc_ - add a comment about this in the docs - _Disable false_ - disable the required false option for this element

Just noticed that this seems to be an on-and-off issue, I've been able to use the NumberSpinner in forms created from ini-files without any issues and without being forced to add a required.

My latest situation where this problem reappears is when I have a form created from ini-files where there are subforms with the NumberSpinners in them. This is all a little strange, hard to understand - probably a dojo error since the submit button doesn't respond.

Here is an example of my current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [followup3]
    ; general form metainformation
    demo.followup3.method = "post"
    demo.followup3.class = "zend_form"
    
    ; initials element
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.type = "TextBox"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.label = "Initials"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.name = "initials"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.required = true
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.prefixPath.validate.prefix = "Max_Validate"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.prefixPath.validate.path = "Max/Validate/"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.prefixPath.validate.type = "validate"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.validators.checkDemoInitials = "checkDemoInitials"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.validators.alnum.validator = "alnum"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.validators.strlen.validator = "StringLength"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.validators.strlen.options.min = "1"
    demo.followup3.elements.initials.options.validators.strlen.options.max = "10"
    
    ; followup3_date element
    demo.followup3.elements.followup_date.type = "DateTextBox"
    demo.followup3.elements.followup_date.options.label = "Followup date"
    demo.followup3.elements.followup_date.options.name = "followup_date"
    demo.followup3.elements.followup_date.validators.date.validator = "date"
    
    ; submit element
    demo.followup3.elements.submit.type = "submit"
    demo.followup3.elements.submit.name = "save"
    
    [followup3_eq5d]
    ; general form metainformation
    demo.followup3_eq5d.method = "post"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.class = "zend_form"
    
    ; mobility element
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.type = "RadioButton"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.options.label = "Mobility"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.options.name = "mobility"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.options.multiOptions.1 = "I have no problems in walkning about"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.options.multiOptions.2 = "I have some problems in walking about"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.mobility.options.multiOptions.3 = "I am confined to bed"
    
    ; current_health_state element
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.type = "NumberSpinner"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.label = "Health state"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.name = "current_health_state"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.places = 0
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.min = "0"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.max = "100"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.smallDelta = "1"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.largeDelta = "10"
    ; the filtering below is for getting a null if the value is empty - for some reason it doesn't do that for me
    ; without some extra filtering
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.prefixPath.filter.prefix = "Max_Filter"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.prefixPath.filter.path = "Max/Filter/"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.prefixPath.filter.type = "filter"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.current_health_state.options.filters.setNull = "setNull"
    
    ; submit element
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.submit.type = "submit"
    demo.followup3_eq5d.elements.submit.name = "save"


Then some code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Dojo_Form');
    $form  = new Zend_Dojo_Form();
    $form->setMethod('post');
    $form->setAttribs(array(
                'name'  => 'masterForm',
                'method' => 'post',
    ));
    
    $form->setDecorators(
    array(
        'FormElements',
        array('TabContainer',
            array(
            'id' => 'tabContainer',
            'style' => 'width: auto; max-width: 800px; height: 600px',
            'dijitParams' => array(
                'tabPosition' => 'top'
            ))
        ),
        'DijitForm',
    ));
    
    ...stuff...
    
    Zend_Loader::loadClass("Zend_Dojo_Form_SubForm");
    foreach ($this->view->group_tables[$group_name] as $table_name) {
        $config = new Zend_Config_Ini($config_file_name, $table_name);
        $new_subform= new Zend_Dojo_Form_SubForm($config->$study_name->$table_name);
        $new_subform->setAttribs(
            array(
                'name'   => $table_name,
                'legend' => $this->view->all_table_key_names[$table_name],
                'dijitParams' => array(
                    'title' => $this->view->all_table_key_names[$table_name],
                ),
                'class' => 'zend_form'
            )
        );
    
        $data = $model->getSubjectArray($subject_id, $table_name);
        $new_subform->setDefaults($data);
        $form->addSubForm($new_subform, $table_name);
    }


I've tried to remove the unnecessary stuff but if it's still unreadable (or due to that) then tell me to re-post.

The reason for the tabbed and non-tabbed issue seems to be related to the the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo::setUseDeclarative()/setUseProgrammatic(): - With declarative use the onSubmit event is connected - With programmatic use the onSubmit event is only connected when I use a form in a tabbed manner as above

The problem with NumberSpinner is connected to the onSubmit event so even though part of the mystery is solved the main problem remains

Sorry for the somewhat messy bug report, hopefully it is now much clearer what needs to be done.

It is important issue. Because Zend\_Dojo\_Form's without "name" works differently in programmatic and declarative modes

ID is enforced during construct, orginal solution to override the Zend\_Form::getName method was unstable. Creating two forms quickly after each other could result in duplicate Id's. In addition, the return value of getName() would not be consistent.

Patch is only partial, since IE (atleast 9) will still submit the form even though it is empty/not validated correctly.. setting the name attribute in addition to the ID did not resolve this

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2011-05-02T19:56:55.000+0000

The provided solution seemed like the incorrect place to do this; if the form name is passed in or changed later, it can cause issues. The more appropriate location seemed to be during decoration, and as such, I've added some code to the DijitForm decorator to generate a name if none is present.

The relevant commit is r23932; please check. If it works, let me know so I can merge it to the release branch; if not, please indicate what's failing -- e.g., if the generation of the dijit.form.Form ID is missing, etc.
