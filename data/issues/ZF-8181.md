### Description

Our application is sometimes causing following exception:

{quote}_Zend\_Locale\_Exception_ Missing locale file '/opt/phplibs/Zend/Locale/Data/es\_ES\_TRADNL.xml' for 'es\_ES\_TRADNL' locale.{quote}

Here the most important steps from our exception stacktrace to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">#0 /opt/phplibs/Zend/Locale/Data.php(216): Zend_Locale_Data::_findRoute('es_ES_TRADNL', '/ldml/dates/cal...', 'choice', 'context', Array)
    #1 /opt/phplibs/Zend/Locale/Data.php(426): Zend_Locale_Data::_getFile('es_ES_TRADNL', '/ldml/dates/cal...', 'choice', 'context')
    #2 /opt/phplibs/Zend/Locale.php(528): Zend_Locale_Data::getList('es_ES_TRADNL', 'Days', NULL)
    [...]

Not reproducable on trunk with this 3 lines. There is not enough information. Please add the complete stacktrace from ZF.

Calling getList() with an not existing locale is already a failure. getList() must be called with an existing locale.

If an locale exists or not is validated by Zend\_Locale, not by Zend\_Locale\_Data. Just with the 3 lines of information I can say that the exception is correect and can not be solved.

Sorry, the application which caused this exception is still using 1.8.1, not 1.9.4 or 1.9.5. Because our development servers are already using 1.9.4 for validation (we'll switch on monday), I thought this bug is existent in current ZF versions.

I reproduced this exception at home with 1.10 from trunk but without using Zend\_Locale::getTransactionList(). So the Zend\_Locale::\_prepareLocale() was not called to shorten the locale.

This bug is already fixed by ZF-8030.
