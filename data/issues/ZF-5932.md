### Description

The setWhen method of Zend\_Gdata\_Kind\_EventEntry expects an array as its argument. The document is inconsistent between examples in 22.5.4.1 and 22.5.4.2; of the three examples given, two treat as an array and one as a single instance. Patch:

Hi Zachary, many thanks for the patch, it's much appreciated!

However, before I can apply it, you'll need to have a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Zend Framework project. Instructions on doing this and an FAQ are here:

<http://framework.zend.com/community/contribute>

Would you be okay with this? Please let me know if you have any questions.

 

 

Posted by Zachary Burnham (zburnham) on 2009-03-03T16:11:03.000+0000

I have no problem with the Agreement. I'll fax it back to you shortly.

Great!

Please follow up on this issue to let me know once the CLA has been received by Zend. I don't work there, so I won't get notified otherwise. :)

I faxed the CLA to Zend last night. I don't know if there's other confirmation to be obtained, and I haven't heard anything from them.

The CLA has been received and processed.

I had to rebuild the patch, because Jira treated spaces and such as formatting, causing me to get the following error:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $ patch -p0 < ~/Desktop/zf-5932.patch 
    patching file Zend_Gdata_Calendar.xml
    patch: **** malformed patch at line 6: $when->endTime="2007-12-05T15:00:00:00-08:00"


I've attached the re-built patch that fixes this.
