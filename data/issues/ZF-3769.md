### Description

a full path in windows "C:\\somewhere\\somefile.php" fails the security check, and cannot be used to load files using the Zend\_loader (cause of the ":" character)

moreover, in windows 64bit, if files are located under the Program Files directory - which is called "Program files (86)" in the 64bit version - it fails as well (cause of the "(" character)

I am finding this same issue right now. Code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    
    try {
        Zend_Loader::loadFile('C:\\Program Files\\PHP\\PEAR\\Zend\\Version.php');
        echo Zend_Version::VERSION;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo 'ERROR DETECTED: ' . $e->getMessage();  // will result in ERROR DETECTED: Security check: Illegal character in filename
    }


Deferring to Wil and Matthew on a solution to this. Seems pretty major.

Fixed in trunk with r12772; presents a minor change in functionality, so will not release until 1.8.0.
