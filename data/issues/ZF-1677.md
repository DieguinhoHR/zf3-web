### Description

There is a validator seems missing in ZendFramework under Validator named StringEquals. Have a look at wiki page [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/DOCDEVSK/13.4.+Zend_Filter_Input).

I believe this validator will help us.

Edited [Please close this entry, it is not an issue, I just read word "hypothetical" with the example over above mentioned wiki page]

There is also a sample implementation of the StringEquals validator in \\tests\\Zend\\Filter\_files\\TestNamespace\\StringEquals.php. It's not part of the library because it has no unit tests or anything. But if you want to use it as the basis for a custom validator, you may.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all closed issues to the person who ultimately fixed them.
