ZF-8133: 2 Routes in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_REST documentation are bold without reason?

### Description

It seems as if the two urls on the bottom of this table ( [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.routes.rest) ) are printed in bold without any (good) reason. If there's a good reason to let those two lines be in bold please comment & close this issue. If not, I will remove the bold tags in a week or so.

I don't see any links printed in bold. Maybe they got fixed in the meantime?

The diff attached changes the tag in the last two urls to which should fix this issue.
