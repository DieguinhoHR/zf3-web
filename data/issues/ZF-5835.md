### Description

I have found bug in File element. when I put file element into subform, then it doesn't have proper name.

Code snipet:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
            $filesForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    
            for ($h1=1;$h1<=5;$h1++) {
                $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
                $subForm->addElement('text', 'name', array(
    
                'filters'    => array('StringTrim' ),
                'validators'  => array('NotEmpty'),
                'label'      => 'N치zev ' ,
                        ));
    
                }
    
                $subForm->addElement('file', 'file', array(
                'filters'    => array('StringTrim', ),
                'label'      => 'Obr치zek',
                'validators' => array (array('Size', false, 5*1024*1024),
                            array('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif'),
                            array('Count',false,1)),
                    ));
    
                $filesForm->addSubForm($subForm,$h1);
            }
    
            $this->addSubForm($filesForm,'new_files');


...

then text elements have the proper names like : _new\_files[1][name]_ , so should file element, bu it is still named only _file_ instead of _new\_files[1][file]_

View script produces code like :

 
    <pre class="literal">


 N치zev Obr치zek label of File Element is properly set, but its id and name doesn't contain parent arrays. I have found that 1.7.5 should have support for FileElement in subforms, but there is still this issue.

I have probably discovered solution :

In Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_File in the version 1.7.5, there is

$name = $element->getName();

on line 91

and there probably should be

$name = $element->getFullyQualifiedName();

Also for right id line 94

should be -

$attribs['id'] = $element->getId();

instead of original

$attribs['id'] = $name;;
