Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders class (singleton) is used to manage special request and response objects (see Zend\_Log\_Writer\_FirebugTest->setUp() method).

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug log writer requests Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp singleton (-primary class for communicating with the FirePHP Firefox Extension-) to be instantiated, which, in turn, registers himself as a controllor plugin of Zend\_Controller\_Front.

If Zend\_Controller\_Front was used before and already has registered request/response objects, Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Broker resets these request/response objects at the provided plugin (Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders singleton) and overrides expected functionality.

Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->resetInstance() at the test setUp() method helps.
