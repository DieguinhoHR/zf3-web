ZF-10780: Factory method for Zend\_Config

### Description

It would be nice to have a factory method for Zend\_Config. It could even dynamically determine the type of Zend\_Config class to create based on the suffix of supplied file. It seems that the framework itself needs it! e.g. Zend\_Application::\_loadConfig, Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Config::loadConfig. Apparently Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_DbAdapter::configure should use it rather than assuming that application is using Zend\_Config\_Ini in line 62 which may not be true.
