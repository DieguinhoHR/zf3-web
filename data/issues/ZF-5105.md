ZF-5105: Extend Zend\_Db\_Expr to use parenthesis when parametr given

### Description

It's now very easy to make queries using Zend\_Db\_Select and push these queries into another query as a subquery. But one of ideas of using Zend\_Db\_Select is that you don't need to play with complex string, but rather use object oriented access. But what's not perfect with current implmentation is that it need to add parenthesis around subquery to push it into another query by HAND.

So I would suggest Zend\_Db\_Expr to have second parameter addParenthesis which will actually add parenthesis around the expression.

So having subselect: $subSelect = $db->select() ->from('items', 'SUM(price)') ->where('items.order\_id = orders.id');

Instead of making query like this: $select = $db->select() ->from('orders') ->columns(new Zend\_Db\_Expr('(' . (string) $subSelect . ')'));

I would like to make it like this: $select = $db->select() ->from('orders') ->columns(new Zend\_Db\_Expr($subSelect, true));
