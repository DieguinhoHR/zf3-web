### Description

Currently, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract has a fetchPairs() method which returns an array of key-value pairs. Why not add a similar method that puts the complete records into the value of the resulting array elements?

Typical use case: loading a complete table in memory at once and being able to directly access it by primary key. Type of table will typically be a lookup table that is referenced by (many) other tables (country codes, statuses, categories, ...) and contains (more than 1 scalar) information about the codes used (label, long description, parent, valid from, valid until). Note that these lookup tables have often more fields than just an id and a label and thus that fetchPairs cannot handle all situations.

Alternatives: - joining these tables with all queries executed on other tables: complexity and performance hit (in the database and the amount of duplicate information sent over the connection) - doing it yourself after executing a fetchAll: performance hit (creating 2 arrays)

The code could be as simple as that of fetchPairs (though I'm not totally happy with the name, but couldn't think of a better one for now):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function fetchKeyRecordPairs($sql, $bind = array())
        {
            $stmt = $this->query($sql, $bind);
            $data = array();
            while ($row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_NUM)) {
                $data[$row[0]] = $row;
            }
            return $data;
        }


Same restrictions hold here as for fetchPairs: first column should return unique values or they will be overwritten.

You describe the fetchAssoc() method

Then the on-line documentation is misleading. It does not say anything about the keys of the first dimension of the result array. Moreover, the example would fail???

15.1.3.3. Fetching a Result Set as an Associative Array The fetchAssoc() method returns data in an array of associative arrays, regardless of what value you have set for the fetch mode.

Example 15.12. Using fetchAssoc()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->setFetchMode(Zend_Db::FETCH_OBJ);
    
    $result = $db->fetchAssoc('SELECT * FROM bugs WHERE bug_id = ?', 2);
    
    // $result is an array of associative arrays, in spite of the fetch mode
    echo $result[0]['bug_description'];


I would expect only to have a $result[2] available when the first dimension contains the bug\_id's as keys.

However, looking at the code of fetchAssoc I see that it is indeed what I requested for (and that my quick coding example would not work for the Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ASSOC mode (as the mode is hard set)).

note: should fetchAssoc not better use reset():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                // isn't this cleaner and faster???
                $key = reset($row);
                $data[$key] = $row;


 
    <pre class="highlight">
                // than this???
                $tmp = array_values(array_slice($row, 0, 1));
                $data[$tmp[0]] = $row;

I reopen as a documentation issue

Attached adjustments to the documentation for $db->fetchAssoc to try to make it clearer

Fixed in documentation with r21080 and reported to 1.10 branch with r21081
