### Description

Initially reported by Cal Evans:
--------------------------------

Every 1.5-2.0 hours the search loses all of it's indexes. ... I'm not sure if the files are getting corrupt or what but the Index just stops working after a while. Right now we rebuild it on a cron job but

that's a temp solution.

Parallel index usage/management is done and tested.
