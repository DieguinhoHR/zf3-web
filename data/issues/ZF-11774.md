This works for me, try to update your ZF version. Regards, Pierre

This is likely an issue with your PHP configuration. The getLatest method uses PHP's fopen function to read the latest ZF version from <http://framework.zend.com/api/zf-version>. If your PHP installation blocks using fopen with URLs the method will not work.
