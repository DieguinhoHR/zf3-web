### Description

In the list of date constants located here

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.constants.html)

under the "Constants for ISO 8601 date output" section, the constant "A" is described as returning the number of milliseconds, when really it returns the elapsed seconds of this day.

Thomas, do you know if this is correct? I looked at this, but didn't find anything about the A constant: [http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/…](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/4021199/ISO_8601_2004_E.zip?func=doc.Fetch&nodeid=4021199).

My issue was that the documentation in the reference guide appeared to be incorrect. I hadn't read the ISO specification, I was just reporting on the documentation from the ZF reference site and the actual functionality in ZF.

All constants are defined here: [http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/…](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Format_Patterns)
