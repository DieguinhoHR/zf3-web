### Description

using the command line tool to add an action to a controller after you've edited the controller cause the second to last curly brace to be deleted from functions. Also the text after the first statement/commend of function gets indented by an extra two tabs.

I'm really sorry if this is not the place to report this. I have a feeling that the CLI tool is a separate project. If so, please let me know where I can report this. Thanks.

This is also true for 1.11.0.

This problem is related to Zend\_Reflection\_Method::getBody(). See issue ZF-9018.

Greetings Ramon

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'duplicate' don't need a fix version -- it makes them appear in the JIRA changelog and/or roadmap.
