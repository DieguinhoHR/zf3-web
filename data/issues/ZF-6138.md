### Description

On [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.html) under 28.1.2. Loading Classes, the text reads:

The string specifying the class is converted to a relative path by substituting underscores with directory separators for your OS, and appending '.php'. In the example above, 'Container\_Tree' becomes 'Container/Tree.php' on Windows.

But instead it should read:

... In the example above, 'Container\_Tree' becomes 'Container\\Tree.php' on Windows.
