ZF-1568: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox values

### Description

In line 100 of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox, the value of generated HTML checkbox is set to $options[0], rather than $value. If you call:

$this->formCheckbox('formElement', $value, NULL, array($requestObj->getPost('formElement'), 0));

before you submit the form, the HTML checkbox will have a value of NULL, rather than the passed $value, since the form hasn't been POSTed yet. Line 100 should read:

. ' value="' . $this->view->escape($value) . '"';

Checkboxes are intended to be toggles, not to have actual values. However, the HTML spec does not indicate they _cannot_ have values, so I've updated the FormCheckbox helper: if a value is specified, it will be used, otherwise the value of $options[0] will be used. Commited in r5480.

This fix needs to be reverted. Numerous users on and off-list are reporting that it introduces a regression.

Reverting as this introduces a regression. Please override the FormCheckbox helper if you need this functionality.
