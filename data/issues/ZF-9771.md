### Description

This part of code in Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_ComboBox line 152

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setAutocomplete($flag)
        {
            $this->setDijitParam('autocomplete', (bool) $flag);
            return $this;
        }


in conjunction with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Dojo::setUseDeclarative();


when trying to set autocomplete feature to 'false' provides a dijit markup with autocompelete="" property which actualy means no value and autocomplete stays on (as it is by default in dojo). Same goes to Dojo\_Form\_Element\_FilteringSelect as it derives from combobox.

Suggestion: set property as is, without type casting.

Manual type casting of the true/false option was needed
