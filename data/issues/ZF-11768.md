At this time, no component in Zend\_Form stores options. setOptions() simply proxies to the various setters on these objects without storing the values. As such, coming up with the configuration would require introspecting each object, as well as each dependent object -- which includes filters, validators, decorators, and more. Simply put, it's a huge architectural change. With the 1.X series nearing end-of-life, it makes no sense to perform a change this large which would benefit a small set of use cases.
