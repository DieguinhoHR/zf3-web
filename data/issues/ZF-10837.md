### Description

Since we now have a phpunit.xml file that loads the TestHelper.php file, it is no longer required to include the file in each and every test.

We've done this in the ZF2 branch already; I'm not sure it's worth the effort to do it in the ZF1 branch -- it took a good week or more poking around to determine what test cases were failing due to never before being referenced, etc. I'd personally suggest skipping this for now.

I've removed the includes of the TestHelper already. It does not affect the skipping of tests.
