ZF-4111: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select auto InArray validator incorrect/unintended behaviour

### Description

When creating an element that allows for multiple selections, the InArray validator automatically set returns false when you would expect it to return true....

If, for example, Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect were used to produce the following select list:

Feed 1Feed 2

and I selected both options, then what would be expected to return on validation would be true as both of the options I'm selecting are in the select list. However, in the InArray isValid() method, the value and haystack look like:

Value = array(2) { [0] => string(22) "http://localhost/feed1" [1] => string(22) "http://localhost/feed2" }

Haystack = array(2) { [0] => string(22) "http://localhost/feed1" [1] => string(22) "http://localhost/feed2" }

which means that the in\_array method is looking for an instance of an array containing feed1 and feed2 in the haystack array, which itself is one-dimensional.

 <?php $value = array( "http://localhost/feed1", "http://localhost/feed2" ); $haystack = array( "http://localhost/feed1", "http://localhost/feed2" ); var\_dump(in\_array($value, $haystack, false)); // bool(false) ?> Correct behaviour for the in\_array function, but incorrect/unintended usage for validating that the options selected are all contained within the select list.

This probably relates to ZF-3985.

I'm running into the same or similar issue in my application. I'm constructing a standard Select Element, a la:

 <?php $Form = new Zend\_Form(array( 'elements' => array( 'select' => array('select', array( 'multiple' => true, 'multiOptions' => array( 'option1', 'option2', ), )), ), )); echo $Form; ?> This produces the desirable effect:

 option1option2 Selecting either option and attempting to validate the form always fails, due to the use of in\_array() in the InArray Validator, as noted above, however validation works correctly when using the Mutiselect Element. I understand that's preferred solution for this problem, but shouldn't Select have _some_ useful behavior defined for when the "multiple" flag / attribute is passed? Is there a plan to merge these two elements? Can I help!? Thanks.

Added a fix for this issue along with the approperiate unit tests.

Does this need to be fixed? I'm thinking it's more of a design choice than a bug; Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select is for single-select combo boxes and Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect is for multiple-select combo boxes. The manual page makes that same distinction ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.standardElements.html#zend.form.standardElements.multiselect)).

Related question: Why is there both Select and Multiselect? Couldn't the two be merged?

Could we perhaps emit a friendly warning when Select is passed multiple=true, just to warn that Multiselect is the better choice?

Marked as won't fix for the following reasons:

1. This is not a Zend\_Validate bug.
2. Issue is not evidenced when using Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect as is the recommended action.
3. Associated patch may fix this particular issue but in the wrong component. The problem lies with Zend\_Form which is why MultiSelect should be used.
