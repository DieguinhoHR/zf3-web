### Description

In the documentation for Zend\_Soap\_Client, PHP's built in SoapClient is used instead in all the examples. I'm assuming then that Zend\_Soap\_Client has an identical interface to PHP's built in class, and that Zend's class is there in case PHP is built without the SOAP extension?

You are correct, thanks for the hint.

Will be in the next minor version manual.
