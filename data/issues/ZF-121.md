### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/139>

The documentation states that multiple Zend\_Db\_Select::from() methods can be called consecutively, but the following code will cause an error (at least in MySQL):-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from('table1', 'id');
    $select->from('table1', 'name');
    echo $select->__toString();


the subsequent query will display FROM table1, table1 which will throw an error in MySQL for not having unique tables.

To fix this problem, the following code could be amended from:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function from($name, $cols = '*')
        {
            // add the table to the 'from' list
            $this->_parts['from'] = array_merge(
                $this->_parts['from'],
                (array) $name
            );
    
            // add to the columns from this table
            $this->_tableCols($name, $cols);
            return $this;
        }


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function from($name, $cols = '*')
        {
            // add the table to the 'from' list
            if (!in_array($name, $this->_parts['from'])) {
                $this->_parts['from'][] = $name;
            }
    
            // add to the columns from this table
            $this->_tableCols($name, $cols);
            return $this;
        }

I don't think this should be supported. Multiple columns from the same table or its alias should be specified in the same call to 'from' or 'join'. Multiple calls should be for other tables or self joins. Please see ZF-204 which makes it a little smarter.

This should be marked invalid in my opinion

A choice must be made between correcting the documentation: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html#zend.db.select.fromcols)

and implementing something similar to the change shown above.

I fail to see what needs to be corrected in the documentation. The examples never suggest that you can add columns to the statement by calling from() multiple times with the same table name.

This:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    should result in a query error until Zend_Db_Select knows how to auto-alias tables to avoid conflicts (ORM solutions do that, for instance). This should be favored instead (in this case):

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize in Zend\_Db\_Select component.

We will not support adding additional columns for the same table in multiple calls to the from() method.

However, there is another use case, that is self-joins. This is covered by the feature request in ZF-204.

So I'm closing this issue, and linking it as a Duplicate of ZF-204.

Linking to ZF-204 as a Duplicate.
