### Description

Would be great to have a backend cache component, which will hold information in static variable, in memory.

This is the implementation, which could be used "as is" or with some corrections: [http://code.google.com/p/fazend/â€¦](http://code.google.com/p/fazend/source/browse/trunk/FaZend/Cache/Backend/Memory.php?r=1548)
