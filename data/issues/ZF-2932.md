### Description

I am using oracle database server 9i and calls to lastSequenceId are failing because the function is improperly quoting the name of the sequence. I hotfixed this issue by removing the quoting as seen here.

 
    public function lastSequenceId($sequenceName)
    {
        $this->_connect();
        // PATCH: I removed the quoting from sequenceName as it was casuing
        // invalid results on Oracle 9i.
        $sql = 'SELECT ' . $sequenceName . '.CURRVAL FROM dual';
        $value = $this->fetchOne($sql);
        return $value;
    }


and my problems were solved.

When you use Oracle, you must specify a param: autoQuoteIdentifier = false in your config or use the good case-folding for the name of the sequence.

In Oracle:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    sequence_name = SEQUENCE_NAME
    sequence_name = "SEQUENCE_NAME"
    but
    "sequence_name" != "SEQUENCE_NAME"


See [10.1.1.4. Adapter Parameters](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.connecting.parameters), and [Example 10.6. Passing the auto-quoting option to the factory](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.connecting.parameters.example2)
