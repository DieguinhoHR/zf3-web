ZF-6576: Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename getNewName parameters (Bit of Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http too)

### Description

In 1.8.0 Beta you would get the original filename in the getNewName function, in the 1.8.0 release it was changed to the temporary name.

So currently we have extended the Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename because we want to apply our own naming scheme to the uploaded files, But we still need to know the original files extension to do this. Before we got the original filename and could use that, now we get the temporary name, which on Windows includes a .tmp extension and on linux doesn't have an extension at all.

At the point where the function get's called (in the Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http line 163) the $this->\_files property hasn't been set yet. We could do it in a hackish way and get the information from $\_FILES, but I much rather have all the information available to the function at that point.

According to API the getNetName() returns the new name of a filtered file without moving it. It's an undocumented internal method and a preparation for an improvement of this filter.

Another point is, that Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename does not know about original, new or old names. This informations are stored within Zend\_File\_Transfer.

To get the old name simply call getFileName() BEFORE calling getValues() or receive(). Calling it afterwards return the new set filename.

The filter is definetly the wrong point to get file informations.

Hello Thomas,

I Am facing the same issue as Haro will trying to move from _ZF_ _1.6_ to _1.8_ I had extended _Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename_ because I wanted my own naming scheme.

But now _Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http_ line 163 call the Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename::getNewName() with the temp name. Why such change ?

And I 'cant use the solution you describe above because I'm using Zend\_Form and everything is seamless handle by Zend\_Form

So right now I'm stuck. The only solution I found is patching Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http. which is not nice. What do you suggest ?

Thanks

Ok,

I found that even if my filter is named Mmx\_Filter\_File\_AutoRename, it get catch by Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::getFilter('Rename') on line 161 Or if it wasn't catch _$filename = $rename->getNewName($content['tmp\_name']);_ wouldn't be called directly and my AutoRename will work has usual.

I see 2 solutions :

_1)_ So what about to be more restrictive on the regex line 1468 in Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_getFilterIdentifier($name) so Mmx\_Filter\_File\_Rename would match and not Mmx\_Filter\_File\_AutoRename

this change will do the trick

 
    <pre class="highlight">
          foreach (array_keys($this->_filters) as $test) {
                if (preg_match('/_' . preg_quote($name) . '$/i', $test)) {
                    return $test;
                }
            }


And it could also avoid some weird thing

_2)_ after get Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::getFilter('Rename') called make sure the filter is Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename like so

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               $rename   = $this->getFilter('Rename');
                    if ($rename !== null && 'Zend_Filter_File_Rename' == get_class($rename)) {
                        $filename = $rename->getNewName($content['tmp_name']);
                        $key      = array_search(get_class($rename), $this->_files[$file]['filters']);
                        unset($this->_files[$file]['filters'][$key]);
                    }

When you have the same problem as Harro then also the solution is the same.

To get the original name you have to store it before calling the rename filter. Before the rename filter is called the original name is returned by getFileName, afterwards the new filename is returned.

According to Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename: This feature was integrated with 1.8 to allow the rename filter to be integrated with Zend\_File\_Transfer. Otherwise Zend\_File\_Transfer would have no way to know how the rename filter wants to rename the files. There were several bugs related to this.

PS: Zend\_Transfer does not exist.

Extending Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename correct would work. But patching Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http to 1.6 again is the wrong way. This introduces again several bugs which have been fixed.

{quote} When you have the same problem as Harro then also the solution is the same. {quote} Well, my question is different (how about with zend\_form ?) so i guess the solution could be different.

{quote} To get the original name you have to store it before calling the rename filter. Before the rename filter is called the original name is returned by getFileName, afterwards the new filename is returned. {quote}

So I need to do all kind of tricking stuff to have it working with Zend\_Form and it is not what I want.

{quote} Extending Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename correct would work. {quote} Yes it would work but right now it won't if the filter name end by "Rename" (AutoRename, MyCustomeRename, etc...) have you consider one of my fix in my previous message for that ?

Thanks
