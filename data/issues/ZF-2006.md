ZF-2006: Zend\_Db\_Statement should have same fetch\* methods as Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Statement currently supports: fetchAll, fetchColumn, fetchObject

while Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract: fetchAll, fetchAssoc, fetchCol, fetchPairs, fetchOne, fetchRow

The method names should be unified (ie fetchColumn and fetchCol) and all methods should exist in both classes. Currently it's counter-intuitive.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
