### Description

Copy of original mail:

I think it would make life and extendability a lot easier if the view detection and actual rendering in Zend\_Controller\_Action would be separated. I simply moved the view detection into another method "getViewScript" and call this one in the original render method. I attached the updated Zend\_Controller\_Action for your viewing pleasure ;-)

This small improvement enables me to extend the Zend\_Controller\_Action in a very simple manner and get the following custom render method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">public function render($action = null) {
    
    // Get the view and config objects
    $view = $this->initView();
    $config = Zend_Registry::get('config');
    
    $view->baseUrl = $this->getRequest()->getBaseUrl();
    $view->title = $config->title;
    $view->theme = $config->theme;
    $view->actionTemplate = $this->getViewScript($action);
    
    // Process and render the additional contents
    $view->shoutbox = $this->_getControllerContent('shout', 'getShoutbox');
    $view->loginbox = $this->_getControllerContent('login', 'getLoginbox');
    
    // Render the base  template
    $this->getResponse()->setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');
    $this->getResponse()->appendBody($view->render('base.php'));
    }

All the magic is done in the line

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    and in the base template I do
    


 <?php echo $this->render($this->actionTemplate); ?> 

```

This way I don't even have to have single header and footer templates :-)
