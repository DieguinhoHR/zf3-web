### Description

Method Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract::toArray() causes fatal error, when there are no rows in a rowset. Probably it's caused by methods fetchRow and fetchAll which both return null instead of object in that case

Not agree that this is bug already that a Row represent a line of the table.

Because not agree I make an analogy with Db. When performing

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    select * from test where id = 1000;


If not exists register some to this query return empty.
