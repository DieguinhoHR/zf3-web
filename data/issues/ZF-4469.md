Why is this component assigned to Wil ??? What is the dev-branch 1.7 ?

I can't find it in SVN... how should I solve this when no branch is available ?

Hmmm. Not sure why it was assigned to me, but it should definitely be assigned to you, Thomas. I verified that you're the component lead in JIRA and the Zend\_Locale component is configured to assign automatically to component lead. In any case, we'll be doing a 1.7 preview release on 9/13. We won't be branching for this, since it's not feature-complete and it would be a pain to merge all the work that will eventually go in to 1.7 RC's. Just check in the fix to trunk. I'll create a release planning page for contributors on the wiki soon, so hopefully you'll be more synced up with our plans.

Thanks for clearification, Wil. So all this issues are related to trunk.

Alex: I understand this issue and know where it's related. Interesting that it's not on windows.

Anyhow... what makes me wonder is that you don't get a notice or something from PHP, because a statically declared method is called from an instance. Shouldn't phpunit also return such errors ???

Should be fixed with r11668. Alex, can you please verify this ?

1. Yeah, fixed!
2. If I'm correct PHP allows to call static methods as instance methods, but not vice versa. But it may depend on a version

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
