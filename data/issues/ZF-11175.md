### Description

The original email has an attachment. The (almost) original email. <http://pastebin.com/0wpDkyrR>

What I get from Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap::fetch() <http://pastebin.com/Cttftnw7>

I debugged the contents up to \_nextLine() where is the fgets command that actually gets the text, but even here the last line (the encoded attachment) reaches truncated.

$line = @fgets($this->\_socket);

By truncating and ending the content prematurely it malforms it and generates other problems like ZF-10168.

I've tried to add a size to fgets() but to no results. I also enabled/disabled "auto\_detect\_line\_endings" php\_ini setting, again to no result.

The file gets truncated in the middle of the line with no apparent reason.

The file contains some sql exports with lines like "----------;----------;----------;-----;--------------------;----------;----------;----------;----------;----------;---------;----------", but the interrupt happend randomly in the line.

I cannot say on what is causing the problem. Other emails are just fine.
