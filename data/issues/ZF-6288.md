### Description

According to your API Documentation and the QuickStart quide, the Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover class should have methods "dump" and "toXml" which call the corresponding methods in the Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl class. Neither of these methods exists in Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover as of 1.7.8 and calls to them end in a fatal error.

The problem is, this two methods are to be released in 1.8 but the manual and API docs for mini releases are also done from trunk, so they slipped in.
