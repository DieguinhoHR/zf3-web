### Description

Join conditions are optional. The following query is legal by the standard and is support by all RDBMS brands:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2


This is particularly common for NATURAL JOIN, because the join condition is implicitly an equi-join between columns with the same name in the two tables. It is also ordinary for a CROSS JOIN to have no ON clause.

Change Zend\_Db\_Select to permit an absent ON clause.

Fixed in revision 3320.

The ON clause is now optional. You can issue a join() without a condition.
