ZF-6971: Zend\_Application\_Module\_Autoloader support missing in findManyToManyRowset method
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-09T22:11:28.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-25T16:53:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When trying to find a many-to-many-rowset via Zend\_Db\_Table's findManyToManyRowset method, you can provide the table names either per string or per object (via Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract subclass instances).

But if you provide the class name as string (e.g. 'Default\_Model\_DbTable\_Foo'), the autoloader settings are ignored and a Zend\_Exception is thrown, stating that the file Default/Model/DbTable/Foo.php can't be found.

Instead, in this example the string should be resolved to the file "APPLICATION\_PATH . '/models/DbTable/Foo.php' ".

Workaround: use new class instances as parameters instead.

This also happens with findParentRow and findDependentRowset

Have you tried with the head version? It works perfectly within my apps...

Another workaround is to require the files manually. This way you can still use the magic functions. I've only tried it with findDependentRowset() and the findBy/Via() functions but I think it should be the same for findManyToManyRowset() and findParentRow().

This does not appear to be an issue. This might have been fixed in part with the new "concrete implementation" features of 1.9. If you can produce a short reproduction case, that would be great and ill reopen.
