### Description

In version 1.9.6 there is no possibility to add method of existing class instance to handle request. Althougth setClass seams to implements such functionality. Why not use it also in addFunction where is possible to add single method from a class. I've made following modification in my local version and it works: on line 129 instead of: $definition = $this->\_buildSignature($method); place this: $definition = $this->\_buildSignature($method,$class);

Regards, Adam
