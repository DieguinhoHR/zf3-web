### Description

As it stands the Page front-end can (optionally) base the hash id on session content, cookies, etc. It also involves the request URI. The latter, however, does not contain the "host" component. If one wishes to use a ZF application behind a set of multiple virtual hosts there is a problem. If you generate absolute links on the page (necessary in case of a desired switch from http to https or vv. the link on the page will be absolute and point to the first host for which the page entry is generated and cached.). Visitors under other hosts names will now receive the cached page that points to the other host.

Simple adding two options: cache\_with\_host\_variables, and make\_id\_with\_host\_variables, and an additional case inside the swith in \_makeId would do the trick.

Of course, in the mean time, one could use a custom front end to do this.
