### Description

It would be useful to be able to inject the ServiceManager into a Route - thus allowing, say, a URL to be checked against a users account via an Account Service.

Failing this, functionality to pull a Route out of the RouteStack, i.e. $sm->get('Router')->getRoute('routename');

Functionality only exists to add a route at present.
