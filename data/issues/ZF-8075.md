### Description

I'm setting baseUrl with resources.frontController.baseUrl = "someValue" (which is written that is autodetected but it's not) Anyway, imho the $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet() $this->jQuery()->addJavascriptFile() and so on, should automatically use baseUrl as a prefix to the specified path to avoid $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet($this->getHelper('baseUrl')->getBaseUrl() . "/rest/of/the/path");

To my (good) surprise, it is used in the Url View Helper. Then why not in jQuery and headLink?

Prepending the base URL is not possible because it would eliminate the ability to use remote scripts/stylesheets/etc. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the jQuery Google CDN ([http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/â€¦](http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js)).

Hi,

Obviously not true, this is very easy to implement, by just adding eregi("http") on the variable containing string of the script. If eregi () then do not append baseUrl, else append. I'm using jquery... :)
