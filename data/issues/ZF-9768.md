ZF-9768: The value passed to setBaseUrl() is case sensitive when the request is routed

### Description

Previously if the case of the base URL portion of the URI was different than that of the value used in setBaseUrl() the route would still successfully get set. Now it appears as though the case of the requested URI must be the same as the value used in setBaseUrl().

For example a request to [https://website.com/intranet/myApplication/â€¦](https://www.website.com/intranet/myApplication/moduleName/controllerName/actionName) would work successfully even with setBaseUrl(/Intranet/myApplication). Currently this request does not successfully match the baseUrl, and as such is trying to use "intranet" as the controller.

Can you provide more details on this issue, because without seeing your routing table I cannot assert this issue is actually an issue (since url path segments are case-sensitive by convention)

This issue still exists in 1.10.7. I've been able to locate why this work in prior versions. In the current version of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setPathInfo() their is a test to see if $requestUri occurs in $baseUrl using strpos(). In versions of the framework prior to this issue such a comparison was not done using strpos(). If strpos() would be changed to stripos() then this issue would be resolved.
