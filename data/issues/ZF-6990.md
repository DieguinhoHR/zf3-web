### Description

Private function Zend\_Gdata\_MediaMimeStream::strlen2() is supposedly "A non mbstring overloadable strlen-like function." - it is never used by its own class. This is a Good Thing, since calling it would most likely throw a fatal error. It calls "char\_count", which AFAIK is not a function. Recommended course of action: remove method entirely.
