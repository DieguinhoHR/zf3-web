### Description

I'm really wondered why there isn't any Factory object for this component. It will be very usefully to have such factory that connected with Zend\_Config can make our life and project management much more easier. So i decided to write one.

It's based on Zend\_Cache::factory, and except ReCaptcha it works well. With ReCaptcha there is small problem with isValid method - it has different syntax, and without changing isValid part inside your code you can't easy change from eg. Zend\_Captcha\_Image to Zend\_Captcha\_ReCaptcha.

Using examples:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
           $captcha = Zend_Captcha::factory(
               'Mao_Captcha_FigletCopy',
               array(
                   'name'         => 'foo',
                   'wordLen'    => 6
               )
           );


 
    <pre class="highlight">
           $captcha = Zend_Captcha::factory(
               'Image',
               array(
                   'name'         => 'foo',
                   'wordLen'    => 6,
                   'font'        => APPLICATION_PATH .'library/html2pdf/font/verdana.ttf',
                   'imgDir'     => APPLICATION_PATH .'public_html/temp/',
                   'imgUrl'    => '/temp/'
               )
           );


I hope that one of ZF developer can take a look at it and include such kind of Zend\_Captcha::factory into ZF.

Zend\_Captcha factory suggestion

ivValid seems to have the same signature on both Zend\_Captcha\_Word and Zend\_Captcha\_Recaptcha:

public function isValid($value, $context = null)

could you clarify what did you mean?
