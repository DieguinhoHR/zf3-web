### Description

Add a filter which is able to convert date inputs from one date format to another date format.

This "could" be used to convert for example: "12.Mai.2009" to "2009.05.12"

Note that both formats are localized. This is the reason why the localizedtonormalized filter does not match for such a usecase.
