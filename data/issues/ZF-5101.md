### Description

On the "Create a Model and Database Table" page of the QuickStart, when adding the Model\_DbTable\_GuestBook table class it mentions the file should be created as application/models/DbTable/GuestBook.php but in the next section it states the model class should be created in application/model/GuestBook.php. I believe both of these should read "models", as it looks like all other references reflect "models" as well.

I don't see this error when I look at the documentation today. Please check: do you agree it has been fixed?

Closing as fixed due to no response from the reporter since 4 months.
