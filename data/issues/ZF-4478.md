I can not verify this one... seems to brake on line 139 or 140:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $this->assertTrue($this->_validator->setFormat('dd.MM.YYYY')->isValid('10.01.2008'));
            $this->assertTrue($this->_validator->setFormat('MMM yyyy')->isValid('Jan 2010'));


but works by me on 2 environments.

Can you please verify at which line the test brakes ? Thanks Alex

The problem is on line 140

It occures if whole tests suite runs and doesn't appear if only Zend\_Validate tests are passed. So it may be side effect of some other tests.

Problem doesn't occure if Zend\_Translate tests are turned off (as well as for [ZF-4476], [ZF-4477], [ZF-4479], [ZF-4481])

Probably fixed with r11751
