ZF-8668: Zend\_File\_Transfer: Adapter does not extend Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-30T05:31:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-14T00:10:18.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)
 
 Reporter:  Ken Stanley (dohpaz)  Assignee:  Thomas Weidner (thomas)  Tags: - Zend\_File\_Transfer
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-8669](/issues/browse/ZF-8669)
 
 Attachments: - [ZF-8668.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/12549/ZF-8668.patch)
 
### Description

When instantiating an instance of Zend\_File\_Transfer, the following exception is thrown:

Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception: Adapter Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http does not extend Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter' in /path/to/Zend/File/Transfer.php on line 56

As of ZF 1.9.6, there is no Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter. Instead, the adapters need to extend Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract. The attached patch fixes the condition and exception message to reflect this.

Change the reference from Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter to Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract.

This proposed patch is replaced by the patch in ZF-8869.

Closing in lieu of ZF-8869.

Please don't close issues where you are wether the maintainer nor the component lead.

Duly noted. In the meantime, would you close this ticket on my behalf since ZF-8669 supersedes this issue. Going forward, I will be sure to be more thoughtful when creating patches. :)
