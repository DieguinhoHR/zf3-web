The tests in Zend\_Mail\_MboxFolderTest should be fixed by #3505. Sorry, the task is not mentioned in the log message because I didn't check for tasks earlier.

Bill -- please verify whether or not tests are still failing in Windows. They run fine from \*nix type boxen at this time.

Yes, I confirm that the test failures 2, 3, and 4 above now pass, testing with revision 3546, Windows XP, PHP 5.2.0.

- testGlobalName()
- testIterator()
- testKeyLocalName()

The first failure above still fails. We discussed this and have decided to mark it "incomplete" pending a fix.

- testHeaderEncoding2()

Assigning to Nico.

With current SVN (4265), these tests don't fail anymore on Ubuntu 6.06, PHP 5.2.1

Revision number 4221 was the build for ZF 0.9.1 beta release.

Therefore this fix is going into ZF 0.9.2.
