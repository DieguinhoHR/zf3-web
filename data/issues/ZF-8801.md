### Description

There is a problem with Zend\_Queue\_Stomp\_Client\_Connection. When using the Activemq with stom in php. The CPU load runs sky high when firing multiple parallel requests to it. The load runs so high the machine becomes unusable.

When you disable the function stream\_set\_blocking line 79: // stream\_set\_blocking($this->\_socket, 0); // non blocking

The CPU usage is low and the machine stays usable.
