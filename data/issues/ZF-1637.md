### Description

When using Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client to execute a remote procedure, if the remote server does not return anything, the following error occurs:

Fatal error: Call to a member function asXML() on a non-object

which is tracked through:

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client->call( ) ../Remedy.php:118 Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client->doRequest( ) ../Client.php:257 Zend\_XmlRpc\_Response->loadXml( ) ../Client.php:242

While it is uncommon for the server to not return anything, it is possible and should be handled, either by throwing an exception or returning a null value.

Resolved in r5478. The issue wasn't unparseable XM (which already raises exceptions), but rather XML that doesn't follow the XML-RPC spec for responses. I've added checks to ensure that the XML structure is correct, throwing an exception if not.
