### Description

On webpage <http://framework.zend.com/download> one can download docs per various versions of ZF. I downloaded 1.0.4 docs and they are in fact docs for 1.5 version, despite file label "1.0.4".

Actually, the documentation for both versions should be the same, since we do not maintain two separate versions of the documentation at this time. I'm resolving as not an issue, but assigning to Alex just in case he has a different opinion.

I agree this is not an issue for now. Documentation should mention, which features are available only in ZF 1.5
