ZF-6670: Zend\_Json\_Encoder::encodeUnicodeString is missing
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The encodeUnicodeString static method of Zend\_Json\_Encoder is missing. It is called into the new method Zend\_Json::\_recursiveJsonExprFinder

Here is a fix :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function encodeUnicodeString($string) {
        $encoder = new self();
        return substr($encoder->_encodeString($string), 1, -1);
    }

I think you might have include path problems. for me the method is there, and unittests run without problems.
