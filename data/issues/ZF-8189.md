### Description

The changes in Zend\_Db\_Select in 1.9.4 release started to raise an undefined variable notice:

( ! ) Notice: Undefined variable: lastFromCorrelationName in /data/html/vilagenet.com.br/library/Zend/Db/Select.php on line 840

To reproduce:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $adapter = Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter();
    
    $select = $adapter->select()
        ->from('sometable', 'id');
    
    $select2 = $adapter->select()
        ->from(null, 'COUNT(*) FROM (' . $select->__toString() . ') AS count');
    
    $result = $adapter->fetchCol($select2);


The variable $lastFromCorrelationName is declared in Zend\_Db\_Select on line 810, inside an if statement, but is used outside it, on line 840.

Moving the declaration to just outside the if (line 800) corrects the problem, and all unit tests still pass.

Tested in trunk and the bug is still present.

It is duplicate of ZF-8190.
