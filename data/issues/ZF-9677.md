ZF-9677: addSubForm problem w. name when form-object is Zend\_Form

### Description

Hello

First congratulations to the makers of ZendFramework. Great Job!

I'm not sure whether this is a bug or wrong usage:

$subform = new My\_Blabla\_Form; //My\_Blabla\_Form is an extension of Zend\_Form $this->addSubForm($subform, 'blabla\_subform'); //$this is also an extension of Zend\_Form

In my Controller: $form->getValues();

blabla\_subform-Values are submitted as array. However the key of this array is empty ([""]).

Only: $subform = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm;

 
        $subform->addElement('text', 'bla, array(
            'label'      => 'Bla',
        ));


leads to a key-name.

Also $subform->setName('blabla\_subform'); doesn't lead to a key-name.

Bug?

Are you willing to provide a stripped down example to reproduce this behavior without your custom Extension to Zend\_Form.

Please note that a Zend\_Form\_SubForm has setIsArray(true) by default, and if you add a Zend\_Form as a SubForm to a Form you will have to call this method by yourself.

Do you mean my code? No problem:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    class mI_Form_Test extends Zend_Form
    {
    
        public function init()
        {
            $this->setMethod('post');
    
            $this->addElement('text', 'test_field', array(
                'label'      => 'Test',
                'size' => 10
            ));
    
            $this->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
                'ignore'   => true,
                'label'    => 'Go...',
            ));
    
            $this->setElementFilters(array('StringTrim', 'HtmlEntities'));
        }
    
    
    
        public function AddSubTest()
        {
            $subform = new mI_Form_SubTest();
            $this->removeElement('submit');
        $this->addSubForm($subform, 'SubForm');
        }
    
    }

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class mI_Form_SubTest extends Zend_Form
    {
    
        public function init()
        {
            $this->addElement('text', 'subtest_field', array(
                'label'      => 'Sub-Test-Field',
            ));
            $this->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
                'ignore'   => true,
                'label'    => 'Go...',
            ));
    
            $this->setElementFilters(array('StringTrim', 'HtmlEntities'));
    
        }
    
    }

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function indexAction()
        {
            $request = $this->getRequest();
            $form = new mI_Form_Test();
            $form->AddSubTest();
            if ($this->getRequest()->isPost())
                {
                      if ($form->isValid($request->getPost()))
                      {
                        var_dump($form->getValues());
                      }
                      else
                         echo $form;
                }
             else
              echo $form;
        }


returns:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    
    I helped myself by gpoing this way:



    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class mI_Form_Test extends Zend_Form
    {
    
        public function init()
        {
            //same as above
        }
    
    
    
        public function AddSubTest()
        {
            $subformclass = new mI_Form_SubTest();
            $elements = $subformclass->getElements();
            $subform = new Zend_Form_SubForm;
            $subform->addElements($elements);
            $this->removeElement('submit');
        $this->addSubForm($subform, 'SubForm');
        }
    
    }


 which leads to: As you can see in both instances SubForm-Values arre submitted as array. The only difference is that if the object which is to be added as a subform is a Instance of Zend\_Form the name of the Subform is NOT used as key but rothaer is empty.

After talking to Matthew in irc, it is consense now that you have to use Zend\_Form\_SubForm or setIsArray(true) on the extended Zend\_Form, when using this as a SubForm.

Resolving as won't fix.

O.K., thanks. The setIsArray(true) is no big deal and easy to implement.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to add this solution to the [manual](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.forms.html#zend.form.forms.subforms) since there it reads: {quote}A sub form may be a Zend\_Form object, or, more typically, a Zend\_Form\_SubForm object.{quote} If one doesn't know that when using a Zend\_Form object setIsArray(true) has to be set one might encounter the same problem I had and first thought of as being a bug.

Manuel you are right, thanks for pointing that out.
