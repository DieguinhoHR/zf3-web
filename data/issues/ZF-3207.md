Use Zend\_View\_Helper\_Doctype to set an XHTML doctype, and the form view helpers will output as you were expecting.

I'm using XHTML1\_TRANSITIONAL; apparently this doesn't support closing tags under the Zend Framework, though I'm pretty sure it should.

I renders the same using XHTML1\_STRICT too.

You need to set the doctype prior to any form being generated. A good place for that is in the Bootstrap since that also centralises the Doctype setting for the entire application.
