### Description

When creating a controller with an index action from the Controller Provider, the View Provider always populates the index.phtml with the "This is your project's main page" view instead of the normal action view.

Patch to pass the module name into the ViewScriptFile Context, allowing it to only create the "full" index.phtml in the default module.

This verbiage has been changed, and the controller & view have had many issues fixed in incubator that fix this issue. These features & fixes will be included in 1.10 release.
