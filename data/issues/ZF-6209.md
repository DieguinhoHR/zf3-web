ZF-6209: Zend\_Config\_Ini ignores first line in .ini file
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-04-03T14:15:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-05T12:11:37.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When ini file looks like: {quote} a = b c = d {quote}

and php code looks like: {quote} $a = new Zend\_Config\_Ini ( APPLICATION\_PATH . '/config/file.ini' );

echo $a->a; {quote}

nothing is displayed. But when ini file looks like: {quote} ; Foo a = b c = d {quote}

above php code will return: {quote} b {quote}

I've just tested this and it works for me.

I created this INI file (zf6209.ini) which has two lines in it: a = b c = d

and this test method within the Zend\_Config\_IniTest class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testFirstLineOfIniIsLoaded()
        {
            $filename = dirname(__FILE__) . '/_files/zf6209.ini';
            $config = new Zend_Config_Ini($filename);
            $this->assertEquals('b', $config->a);
        }


This worked as expected.

Can you check this too please?

Can you tell me which line endings you have in your ini file and which PHP version you are using on which OS?

Zend Tests doesn't work for me. I wasted over an hour trying to run it... nevermind.

I prepared

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    system.ini


in UTF-8 on Windows XP using Notepad++. Line endings: [CR][LF].

Content of file.ini:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    environment = development
    test = works


bootstrap.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    // ścieżka do aplikacji
    defined('APPLICATION_PATH')
        or define('APPLICATION_PATH', dirname(__FILE__));
    
    // konfiguracje
    $configurations = array
    (
        'system',
        'application',
        'db',
        'session',
    );
    
    foreach ($configurations as $configuration)
    {
        Zend_Registry::set
        (
            'configuration' . ucfirst($configuration),
            new Zend_Config_Ini(APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/' . $configuration . '.ini')
        );
    }
    
    /* constant test */
    if(defined('APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT'))
    {
        die('Already exists');
    }
    /* end */
    
    // tryb wyświetlania strony
    defined('APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT')
        or define('APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT', Zend_Registry::get('configurationSystem')->get('environment'));
    
    /* parse_ini_test */
    $foo = parse_ini_file (APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/system.ini');
    
    echo '


    ';
    print_r ($foo);
    echo '

    ';
    /* end */
    
    echo 'Should be "environment": '.APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT.'<br></br>';
    echo 'Should be "works": '.Zend_Registry::get('configurationSystem')->get('test');
    exit;

Which displays:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [﻿environment] => development
        [test] => works
    )
    
    Should be "environment":
    Should be "works": works


php\_info ();

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Version 5.2.5

But... I just noticed that when .ini is in ANSI (not in UTF-8) everything is working fine.

This is a PHP bug (<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45991>) which presumably will be fixed when 5.3 is released.

But strange is fact that simple parse\_ini\_file() on UTF-8 ini file works fine, but the same function in Zend\_Config\_Ini class doesn't.

If I do a Zend\_Debug::dump($config->toArray()); then I see:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(2) {
      ["﻿a"] => string(1) "b"
      ["c"] => string(1) "d"
    }


Ideas on how to fix the get() function are welcome!

A little more investigation with var\_dump() shows that the key "a" is actually a 4 byte string and that the "c" key is a 1 byte string. I've no idea why and suspect that it's related to parse\_ini\_file() as the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $file = parse_ini_file($filename);
    if(array_key_exists('a', $file)) {
        echo "found the 'a' key";
    } else {
        echo "didn't find the 'a' key";
    }


outputs: didn't find the 'a' key

Can't fix at Zend\_Config level. Workaround is to use UTF8 files without a BOM marker or to have a comment / blank line as first line of file if you must have a BOM marker.
