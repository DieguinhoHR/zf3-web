### Description

We've been promising this method since May. We really should release it and update the tip:

The tip also says: Update: Version 1.7.1 and higher of the PHP Client Library has a new method "getFullVideoEntry()" that should take care of this.

Is that not correct?

Yes, that will work. Can we target to 1.7.1 and close?

But, it's already in 1.7.1 and 1.7.1 is already released?
