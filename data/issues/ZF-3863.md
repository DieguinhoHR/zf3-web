### Description

Docs on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.test.phpunit.html) says: # assertQueryContentCount($path, $count, $message = ''): assert that there are exactly $count DOM elements matching the given CSS selector present. If a $message is present, it will be prepended to any failed assertion message. # assertQueryContentCountMin($path, $count, $message = ''): assert that there are at least $count DOM elements matching the given CSS selector present. If a $message is present, it will be prepended to any failed assertion message. Note: specifying a value of 1 for $count is the same as simply using assertQuery()

These methods don't exists. I guess it's a typo, methods names should be assertQueryCount() & assertNotQueryCount().
