### Description

If a form is validated, the translator of the form will be passed through all elements and all validators of the elements.

Specifying a different translator for an element or a validator of an element will therefor be overridden and will result in the translator being discarded for individual validators and formelements.

In my opinion there should be a check to determine if a translator has already been set for individual formelements or validators rather than just "blindly" passing the translator of the form onto it's children.
