ZF-9625: Zend\_Form\_Element default value is not considered in isValid method

### Description

Hi all, I do this in my xml configuration file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    This is a default value for this not optional paramtruefalse


So I have a form, with two fields: - param\_not\_optional, with text type, required but with a default value set to "This is a default value for this not optional param" - the second, param\_optional, it's a text too, not required.

I suppose that my client post my form, but don't set the "param\_not\_optional" value, so when I will call the "isValid" method for my form, NONE error should be throw, because this param is required and it has a DEFAULT VALUE. But the isEmpty Error is launch. When I look at the code in the isValid method in Zend\_Form\_Element, in the first line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       public function isValid($value, $context = null)
        {
            $this->setValue($value);
            $value = $this->getValue();
            ...
        }


Before the setValue, $this->getValue() return my default value, as I want.But the setValue set my value to NULL, because the field is posted with no value. So my default value is lost, and the setRequired validator always send me an error(if no value is passed). I know that normally, the default value apply to my Form\_Element should be put this text in my text element, so the value must be post and send to isValid method. But I developpe webservices, and I try to use Zend\_Form to validate the data received by my client, that why default value are not inevitably posted. It is possible to do that?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Do i understand this right, you are asking for a required Element that passes Validation when there is no Value posted?

So the one who is filling the Form cuts the Default Value before posting? Then this is intentionally blank, and the error is correct.

Reading further down, write your own Element extension, or even better your own Validator to which you set the appropriate Default Value.

Changing Type of Issue to Feature Request, and Priority to minor.

Ok, so i will create my own element. When I saw the default value method, I believe that do what I wanted, that why I posted here. Thanks for your reply

Yes i see the reason for your Issue, however you know that you are able to use Validators without Zend\_Form, right? Maybe you would better not use Zend\_Form in this case, and use the Validators from within your Model or Controllers? And furthermore for Help Requests use irc #zftalk or the [mailing list](http://n4.nabble.com/Zend-Framework-f634138.html) next time ;p

Resolving as Won't Fix, because this could be resolved by setting appropriate Validators.
