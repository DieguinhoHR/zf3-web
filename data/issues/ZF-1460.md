ZF-1460: Redirector::setGotoUrl ignores prependBase
---------------------------------------------------

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $prependBase = ($options['prependBase']) ? true : false;


should be

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $this->_prependBase = ($options['prependBase']) ? true : false;


this breaks Action::\_redirect calls with that option, exit option also appears to be wrong

We must always use setPrependBase() to set $this->\_prependBase, and $this->\_prependBase is a default option for all methods in the class.

In fact, $prependBase is forgotten in the condition below, so its value is never used ($this->\_prependBase() is always called actually for relative url. We can't deactivate it).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // If relative URL, decide if we should prepend base URL
            if (!preg_match('|^[a-z]+://|', $url)) {
                $url = $this->_prependBase($url);
            }


see attached patch file for correction

Resolved in r5282. The exit flag was also suffering a similar issue, and I corrected that simultaneously.
