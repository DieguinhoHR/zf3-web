### Description

the name attribute was deprecated in version 1.7.3 of the Zend Framework in line with the XHTML spec: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10>

however the w3schools reference shows this attribute as still valid: [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag\_form.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp)

My suggestion would be to either alter the $name attribute for the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form to $id, as the following line:

$this->\_getInfo($name, $content, $attribs)

uses $name as $id if the id is not set in the attributes, or more preferably (if backwards compatibility is required) set the argument to:

$name = null

and add a check to see if it's not null throwing an exception if the if statement is true to stop developers from trying to apply a name attribute.

I do understand that w3schools is not W3 Consortium, I was just pointing this out to show that some users may not understand from using w3schools as to why the cannot add a name to the form tag

Your second comment would to me imply this code is actually broken and invalid.

You cannot add a name tag to a form the way the code currently is, whether that be via the $name variable, or via the attributes.

The $name does nothing now as this is never set on the element due to the code being removed, and via attributes it is removed from the array by $this->\_getInfo as it is expecting name to be set separately and not wanting repeated attributes.

surely if your view is correct we should be allowing developers to add a name tag if they would like one?

w3schools !== W3 Consortium. The official specification is at <www.w3.org>.

Also, an interesting point: the HTML specification actually allows for arbitrary attributes in tags - which makes expressly forbidding the addition of a "name" attribute a bit moot.

Why do you _need_ a "name" attribute in your form in the first place? What purpose will it serve? No modern JS toolkits will select the form based on name (they operate on the ID), and the name provides no real semantic purpose.

Frankly, if you have a need for the functionality, use the plugin system to your advantage: extend the helper and modify it to allow setting the name attribute, and ensure that helper is on your view helper's helper paths.

I'm not going to go back and forth adding and removing features and making the helpers infinitely flexible -- the plugin architecture already provides the flexibility needed for those with special needs. Yes, we removed the "name" attribute from the helper, due to issues some developers were having with validators. While the validators do not validate exactly to the specification, they do provide a baseline for us, and for that reason we typically honor such requests. In this particular case, you're making a request that goes counter to published specifications (it's been deprecated even in HTML 4).
