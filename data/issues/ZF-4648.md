ZF-4648: Invalid use of 'switch' command
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2008-10-20T08:37:54.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-10-20T10:03:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The switch command is used the following way in several places (e.g. Zend\_Form->addSubForms(), and addDisplayGroups()

$argc = count($spec); switch ($argc) { case 0: continue; case (1 <= $argc): $subForm = array\_shift($spec); case (2 <= $argc): $name = array\_shift($spec); case (3 <= $argc): $order = array\_shift($spec); default: $this->addSubForm($subForm, $name, $order); }

which is a misunderstanding of the switch command. For $argc having value greater or equal than one, Cases will be evaluated first, so (1 <= $argc) evaluates to true; After that $argc will be converted to boolean for comparison (having true value since not equals 0 ). As result the first case will always match, shifting null values to some variables. Suggested solution:

$argc = count($spec); if (0 <= $argc) { if ( 1<= $argc) { if (2 <= $argc) { if (3 <= $argc) { $order = array\_shift($spec); } $name = array\_shift($spec); } $subForm = array\_shift($spec); } $this->addSubForm($subForm, $name, $order); }

Can you give an example when a null value is actually shifted to a variable? I'm not going to change working, tested code unless there's an actual reproducible issue.

I see your point, it is not easy to find good examples (like $form->addSubForms(array('name' => array($subform))); which can be reformulated to $form->addSubForms(array('name' => $subForm)); or $form->addSubForms(array(array($subForm, 'name'))); ) So I change the issue type.

However this coding practice is wrong and should be avoided.

This is not a violation of our coding standards, and is, in fact, a perfectly valid way of using switch/case. I'm closing the issue.
