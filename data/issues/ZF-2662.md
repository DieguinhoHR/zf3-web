ZF-2662: disableTranslator flag in Zend\_Form\_Element

### Description

Currently there is no way to specify that a particular element in a given form should NOT be translated even if a default translator instance is available in Zend\_Form. As per the discussion referenced below, I am suggesting the addition of a disableTranslator flag in Zend\_Form\_Element which would allow automatic translation to be turned off on an element-by-element basis.

For original discussion, see [http://nabble.com/Language-names-assigned-to-multiâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Language-names-assigned-to-multiSelect-get-converted-back-into-language-region-codes-to15491255s16154.html)

The original discussion primarily references the option labels in select menu form fields; however, this flag should apply to other kinds of properties in other elements as well (for instance, the "description" and "label" properties).

Added a minor clarification to the issue description.

Will need to add: \* accessor, disableTranslator(), to Zend\_Form\_Element \* logic to Zend\_Form\_Element::getDefaultTranslator() to _not_ pull from Zend\_Form or the current element when disableTranslator is true

Zend\_Form, Element, and DisplayGroup all now have a 'setDisableTranslator()' method (and corresponding config key 'disableTranslator') that allows you to disable translations for that item (setting it on the form will disable for the entire form).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setDisableTranslator();
    
    $element->setDisableTranslator();
    
    // Check the flag status:
    if ($form->translatorIsDisabled()) {
        // disabled!
    }


Committed to trunk and release branch.
