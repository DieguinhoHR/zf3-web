Did you send them from the same host? Same from-address, same to-address?

What happens if the bodies also are exactly the same? You´ll need to find the one thing that differs on which google bases its judgement.

When we send e-mails via Kayako or Outlock with smtp option, the mail goes to inbox but when we send it with zend\_mail it goes directly to the spam box. Even when we make the mail and subject exactly the same, it goes to the spam box.

When sending using zend\_mail, you are sure you're using an smtp server rather than sendmail?

Thankyou for all replies.

I sent once "HELO/EHLO" and my issue solved.
