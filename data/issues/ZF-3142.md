ZF-3142: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text::isValid returns wrong value with NotEmpty validator

### Description

When assigning a NotEmpty validator to a Zend\_Form\_Element, the element's isValid method returns true with an empty value.

The workaround I found is to set the elements allowEmpty property to false by hand, because the default value is true.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Form/Element/Text.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Validate/NotEmpty.php';
            
    //element one, with NotEmpty validator and allowEmpty = true (default value)
    $elementOne = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('emptyFieldOne');
    $elementOne->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty());
    $elementOne->isValid(''); // returns true
            
    //element two, with NotEmpty validator and allowEmpty = false (assigned by hand)
    $elementTwo = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('emptyFieldTwo');
    $elementTwo->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty());
    $elementTwo->setAllowEmpty(false);
            
    $elementTwo->isValid(''); //returns false

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

If you do not mark the element as required, then the results you see are exactly as I would expect. When the element is not required and passed as empty, then no validators will be run unless you have marked allowEmpty as false.

I suppose you're right. I've tested this with another validator and was a little confused by the API Documentation

 
    <pre class="highlight">$element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('element1');
    $element->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_StringLength(5, 10));
    if($element->isValid('')) {
        echo "Element is valid";
    } else {
        echo "Element is invalid";
    }

The above example results in "Element is valid"

I was confused because the API doc on Zend\_Form\_Element::setAllowEmpty() states: ??When the allow empty flag is enabled and the required flag is false, the element will validate with empty values?? So I thought the validators would run and $element->isValid('') would return false when allowEmpty = true and required=false (wich are the default values), but they don't as the example showed.

In any case, thanks for your patience

It may be worth adding a note about this to the documentation.

The only way to set the text for NotEmpty is to add it yourself, and to get the validator to run after adding it, you have to call setAllowEmpty properly.
