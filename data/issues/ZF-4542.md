It's not that SQL Server doesn't support unicode; it's that it only supports unicode in one format: UCS-2. If you are using UTF-8, you will likely have to do encoding conversion in your application. I've updated the reference guide with this information. See: <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/232580>.

Fixed on trunk with r12844.
