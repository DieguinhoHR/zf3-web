ZF-6181: Zend\_Layout\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Layout not covered in sufficient depth

### Description

This action helper is mentioned briefly and usage of it to set or disable the layout is shown in the Reference Guide section for Zend\_Layout, but that's really all it receives. This is insufficient.

1) The direct() and getLayoutInstance() helper methods to get access to the current layout instance are not mentioned in the Zend\_Layout section or the Quick Start Guide. Examples in the former show how to reference variables from layout scripts, but not how to assign them from the controller action method.

2) The Layout helper is not mentioned in the Zend\_Controller section on action helpers. Users who might look for it here will come up empty.

3) Finally, because its class name is inconsistent with other action helpers, the Layout helper is also not immediately obvious in the API docs. Most users will check Zend\_Layout first, then Zend\_Controller\_Action, and if they're looking carefully will find it there.
