### Description

There is a small typo in the declaration of a variable in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect view helper class:

Starts line 100:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // now start building the XHTML.
    $disabled = '';
    if (true === $disable) {
        $disabled = ' disabled="disabled"';
    }


The following code uses both variants as of line 134.

This can be resolved as bogus. The variable is created from line 68 and the function extract().
