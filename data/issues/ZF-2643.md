Was editing a doctype at the type at the time of writing and meant to state docblock.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Each of the server components -- and WSDL autodiscovery falls in this category -- utilizes the PHP docblocks provided by the developer to determine the parameter and return types. In fact, for scalar types, this is the only way to determine the parameter types, and for return types, this is the only way, period, to determine them.

If you are not providing them, we cannot build the WSDL accurately, as the types are unknown; this would lead to breakage in the clients connecting to the service. Additionally, it's an issue of best practices; you _should_ be giving complete API documentation for each method, which would include documenting each parameter and the return value.

Type changed from 'Bug' to 'Docs: Task' (the behavior should be described in the documentation)

Done.

@matthew: you can't do, because phpdoc requires this: {quote} @return type description This tag should not be used for constructors or methods defined with a void return type. {/quote} [<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc>]

If there is no @return-comment, you can safely assume that the method has no return value. (That is not the same as one-way communication though) See also: [[http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/â€¦](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.return.pkg.html)]

Very important!
