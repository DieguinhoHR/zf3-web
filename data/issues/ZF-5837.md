### Description

When no variable given to the setRenderMode() function, this variable is not defined. Officially it should be.

I cannot reproduce this at all.

On line 102 the variable is initialized per default:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected $_renderMode = ZendX_JQuery::RENDER_ALL;


What subsequent calls lead to this error?

Hm, I don't seem to be able to reproduce this error, strange enough. Have had a look at the code and it seems to be allright indeed. Sorry for wasting your time, I will open a new issue if I get the error again.

hello,

this is not waste of time, its always good to be sure of your code, when looking at it again. :-)
