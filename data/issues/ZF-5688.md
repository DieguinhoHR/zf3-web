ZF-5688: Naming convention possible mistake
-------------------------------------------

### Description

Hi,

I noticed this potential mistake into naming convention:

Zend\_Controller\_Front setDefaultAction (string $action) Zend\_Controller\_Front setDefaultControllerName (string $controller) Zend\_Controller\_Front setDefaultModule (string $module)

So just Controller has Name...

Similar is on get methods:

string getDefaultAction () string getDefaultControllerName () string getDefaultModule ()

The naming differences are due to naming conventions that had been present prior to a refactoring of the MVC layer that took place during the fall of 2006. Unfortunately, changing the names of public methods introduces a BC break, so will need to wait until 2.0.
