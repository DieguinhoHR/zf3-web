### Description

If find() finds a lot of results, memory-usage can be enormous. If I still _need_ all of the results, I cannot use setResultSetLimit. It would be great if a complementary function to find() returned an iterator, which would keep memory-consumption down if I don't need the results afterwards (and don't need them sorted either).

use case: I have different types of documents in the same index, each with a keyword field named doctype. Now I want to delete all documents of a specific doctype.

The following code implements this but can take a huge amount of memory depending on the number of hits

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $query = Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::parse('doctype:books');
    $hits = $searchindex->find($query);
    foreach($hits as $hit) {
        $searchindex->delete($hit->id);
    }


What I would like to see is similar code but without the memory hit

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $query = Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::parse('doctype:books');
    $hits = $searchindex->findIterator($query);
    foreach($hits as $hit) {
        $searchindex->delete($hit->id);
    }


There are some possible workarounds I can think of, neither of which works great.

- Loop through all documents using index->numDocs and index->getDocument, and test for doctype myself. For more complex queries this would not work as well, because you are recreating the find() functionality in your own loop. Plus, it takes a lot of time to retrieve each document and test it, lots more than the find() takes.
- Use separate indexes for doctypes so you can just delete an entire index, but the point is to use a single search for all doctypes, and also, this won't work for more complex queries

I've found a workable workaround for this particular test, but for more complex queries this would be cumbersome.

The following works using low memory and acceptable time:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $term = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_Term('books', 'doctype');
    $docids = $searchindex->termDocs($term);
    foreach($docids as $docid) {
        $searchindex->delete($hit->id);
    }

Please categorize/fix as needed.
