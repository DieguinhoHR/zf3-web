### Description

For me it's looks somehow crazy that you select Rowset via $referenceMap (->findReporter(), ->findEngineer(), ->findVerifier()), but can't build an Join Statement with them.

We need to write: $db->select() ->from(new Bugs()) ->join('accounts', 'accounts.account\_name = bugs.reported\_by') ->join('accounts', 'accounts.account\_name = bugs.assigned\_to') ->join('accounts', 'accounts.account\_name = bugs.verified\_by');

instead of just

$db->select() ->from(new Bugs()) ->join(new Accounts());
