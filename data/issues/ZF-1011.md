### Description

Hi,

add static method: Zend\_Db::listSupportedAdapters(void) return array of all database adapters which supported by Zend\_Framework and installed php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
      '' => ''
      [, '' => ''[, ...]]
    )


e.g:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
      'pdo_mysql' => 'MySQL over PDO',
      'pdo_sqlite' => 'SQLite over PDO',
      'oracle>'  => 'Oracle',
      'mysqli' => 'MySQLi',
      'db2' => 'DB2',
    )

This seems like a useful feature, but it has no way of discovering any new adapters, including adapters that are implemented by a third-party, outside the Zend\_Db\_Adapter package space.

Adapters outside of ZF can't open with Zend\_Db::factory(). Otherwise it must create an interface to add other adapters to ZF like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Db::addAdapter(, [, ])

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning as Ralph is the maintainer of Zend\_Db

This would likely be a feature in a large environment component if we were to implement it. Closing for now as it is very old with no votes.
