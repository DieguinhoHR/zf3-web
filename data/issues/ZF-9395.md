### Description

When I use fetchAll('','recipe\_type') I get

Message: SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ') ORDER BY `recipe_type` ASC' at line 1

My understanding is that the column to be ordered is what needs to be passed to fetchAll().

This is not an issue, you have simply used the wrong syntax. if you do not wish to provide a where part for your query, you should supply null and not ''.

Also, please note, you have not stated which fetchAll you are using, nor correctly assigned this issue to a component. For future posts, please provide more detailed information.
