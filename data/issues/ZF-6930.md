### Description

Hi

I would like to see some logic in replacing elements in the returned twitter message

i.e items beginning with

http:// or even www. should be hyperlinked correctly

@ reference tags linked

hashtags linked to <http://hashtags.org/> optional
==================================================

Happy to help out with this - please provide some guidance on patching - or becoming a contributor to this package if you need help
