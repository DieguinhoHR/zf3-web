### Description

The description for the Zend\\Di\\Di Exception could be a little bit more descriptive when a class could not be found. Currently it says: 'Class ' . $aliasMsg . $class . ' could not be located in provided definition.' which makes me think that there is a definition, but that it's wrong. I propose to make it: 'Class ' . $aliasMsg . $class . ' could not be located in provided definitions.' which is a trivial fix, I know. But it's a bit more accurate.
