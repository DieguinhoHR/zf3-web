### Description

Would it be OK to add the 'assign' method to the list of functions that can be executed in a fluent transaction?

E.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->setScriptPath('../application/views/scripts')
         ->setHelperPath('../application/views/helpers')
         ->assign('foo', $bar)
         ->assign('data', $data)
         ->render('path/to/view.phtml');
