Looks like crazy Windows is getting confused about directory separator chars. I wonder if one could quantify the cost in engineering hours of this one design flaw of Microsoft DOS and Windows over the past 25 years?

Should be resolved; several unit tests were not using DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR, which would cause string comparisons on Windows to fail. I updated the tests in a commit earlier on another issue.
