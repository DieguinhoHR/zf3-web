### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row stores its modified data into its $\_modifiedFields array attribute. It then uses that array to know if data have been modified, when calling save(), for exemple.

However, that information is protected, and it could be usefull in some cases to know if the row has been modified.

I suggest the creation of a hasBeenModified() public method, that just returns something like empty($this->\_modifiedFields).

This has already been proposed in ZF-2360.
