ZF-9460: Zend\_pdf : deleting pages and $pdf->save()

### Description

I open a pdf file I delete some pages using unset($pdf->pages[$id]); and I save the file $pdf->save($filename) If I open the file with a pdf reader I see only the remaining pages. But since the resulting file size was basically the same size I opened it with a text editor to check it and I found out the all the deleted pages are still there. It seem that deleting pages unlink them from the visualization but not delete the info from the file content. I dunno if this is the normal behaviour of the save method.

Looking at the api I saw that there is a parameter, so I tried to use $pdf->save($filename, $updateOnly) with $updateOnly=true. I thought that this is the way to have only the remaining pages in the file, so as result I expect to have the file with only the remaining pages (both visualization and file content).

As result I got a file that apparently has only the remaining pages (looking at the size) but all the pages are blank, no text in them.

Apparently it is duplicate of ZF-9458.
