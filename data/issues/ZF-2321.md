ZF-2321: Zend\_Db\_Select->where does not work with float and locale changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-12-17T09:14:28.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-06-01T13:45:32.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If a different decimal separator is used thanks to locale:

$select->where('floatCol = ?', 1.234);

will produce: WHERE floatCol = 1,234

in place of: WHERE floatCol = 1.234

I think it would be interesting to run the testsuite with different locales.

Can you please provide some more information as to which locale? Are you using the Zend\_Locale component or native PHP?

Using native PHP and Zend\_Translate->setLocale();

First: setlocale(LC\_ALL, 'fr\_BE.UTF-8');

And some lines after: $i18n = new Zend\_Translate('gettext', $languageDir . 'en/LC\_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'en'); $i18n->addTranslation($languageDir . 'fr/LC\_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'fr'); $i18n->addTranslation($languageDir . 'nl/LC\_MESSAGES/messages.mo', 'nl'); ... $i18n->setLocale('fr');

In any case, it should be easy to fix with sprintf('%F', $float);

%F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.

You should not rely on setlocale() as it's not secure in multithreaded environments.

Using components from the I18N core you must set your locale to UTF-8 or use Zend\_Locale.

Changing the locale within your scripts is not secure. What if your have 2 users which run through this code almost the same time ? The first set's UTF8 runs through the translation. The second set's UTF8, then the first unsets UTF8. Now the second run's through a I18N component WITHOUT HAVING THE LOCALE SET AS SET BEFORE !!

Related to the original problem, it is also possible to use Zend\_Locale\_Format to get a normalized locale unaware notation of numbers. Zend\_Locale itself was designed to be aware of such problems and locale overall notations.

Hi Thomas - I think the setlocale() is shown purely to help reproduce the bug.

Regarding Zend\_Locale in this context - I was keen to provide a solution using only sprintf('%F', $value) as shown as it reduces the dependencies within the Zend\_Db component. But it's good to know from a developer perspective that Zend\_Locale can do this. Cheers

We exclusively use non-multithreaded environments and most of the time I suggest using core php functions over functions written in PHP. The bug here was not related to Zend\_Translate at all, I mention it just because of Simon's #1 question.

By the way, I am really disappointed it tooks 5 months to ask me for more information for such an easy bug to resolve. I hope it's not the reflect of Zend's strategy to promote their Zend Framework Support.
