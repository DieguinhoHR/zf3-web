### Description

{quote} CawaSPB, weierophinney why are the Dojo Demos shipped with ZF full? The demos themselves are 27Mb (extracted), seems like a disk space saver to me... Freeaqingme: the demos are in there? I thought I was stripping them. I'll look into that. they were so with 1.8.3 too Freeaqingme: can you put an issue in the tracker regarding the dojo demos, please? that way I can keep track of it. sure weierophinney, assign it to you? yes, please{quote}
