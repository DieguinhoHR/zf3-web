ZF-11810: Cascade delete does not work for customly deleted rows
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-10-09T18:18:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-06-15T13:40:30.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.12.0 (27/Aug/12)

### Description

The cascadeDelete() method works only when the delete operation is performed over a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row. For instance it works successfully in the following case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Application_Model_DbTable_Sample();
    $table->find(12)->current()->delete();


but it does not work for:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Application_Model_DbTable_Sample();
    $table->delete('id=?',12);


seems like a bug, right?
