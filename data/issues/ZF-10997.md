ZF-10997: Add weekday constants in Zend\_Date
---------------------------------------------

### Description

Two constants in Zend\_Date exist to check the day of the week: Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_DIGIT and Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_8601. The other Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\* provide localized versions so you cannot rely on them to check the day of the week.

Nevertheless I prefer validating against a constant than a known integer:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (Zend_Date::now()->get(Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_DIGIT) === Zend_Date::FRIDAY) {echo 'Almost weekend!';}


Instead of this I have to remember the weekday codes and it makes the code less readable

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (Zend_Date::now()->equals(5,Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_DIGIT)) {echo 'Almost weekend!';} //What is 5?


I suggest the following list:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    const MONDAY        = '1';
    const TUESDAY       = '2';
    const WEDNESDAY     = '3';
    const THURSDAY      = '4';
    const FRIDAY        = '5';
    const SATURDAY      = '6';
    const SUNDAY        = '0';
    const SUNDAY_8601   = '7';


For Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_DIGIT you can use the MONDAY - SUNDAY constants, for Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_8601 you can use the same set, only you need to take care the Sunday is different. We can also make a Zend\_Date::MONDAY\_8601 etc if this can be confusing.
