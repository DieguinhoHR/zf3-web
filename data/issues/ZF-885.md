### Description

Currently, there is no extremely easy way to choose some of the most popular date formats, like "Y/m/d" or "Y-m-d H:i: s".

I suggest adding these to the "additional date format" constants (and support for these).

All of this formats can be parsed by using the constant ISO\_8601. They are noted in ISO convention and ISO is the standard constant for parsing those dates.

I would not add more constants if it's not really needed. We already have 50 constants.

Btw: I never heared of a "Y/m/d" format, and the second one is SQL format. SQL was depreciated by the devteam when I wrote my proposal. I would have added it, but so it is accepted by ISO\_8601...

When someone wants a "popular" format he likes and which is not supported he always can do this with toString();... I would se no limitations from that...

Your opinon ?

Right. This problem can partly be solved by documentation. Reassigning to me ...

If you have a date string in the format of Year-Month-Day, or "Year-Month-Day hour minute second", then use:

$date = new Zend\_Date($inputString, Zend\_Date::ISO\_8601);

See FishEye link for additional documentation added to the manual.
