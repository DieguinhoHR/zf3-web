ZF-8485: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha always fails if rendered piecemeal

### Description

Related to [ZF-7404]. The reason my proposed fix was rather round-about was so that it would also cover the captcha form element. It still doesn't work, however. Before this, it isn't really possible to break apart and render separately a captcha element since important stuff is happening in render() which is skipped during \_\_call(). Now it is possible to call renderCaptcha() and renderCaptcha\_Word(), but they wouldn't ever match because the hidden element's value would be generated twice.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->viewRenderer()->setNoRender();
    
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement('captcha', 'captcha', array('captcha' => 'Dumb'))
         ->addElement('submit', 'submit');
    
    if ($this->_request->isPost()) {
        var_dump($form->isValid($this->_request->getPost()));
    } else {
        echo $form->renderForm(false);
        echo $form->captcha->renderCaptcha();
        echo '<br></br>';
        echo $form->captcha->renderCaptcha_Word();
        echo $form->submit;
        echo '';
    }


_Action:_ enter the correct word _Expected:_ true _Actual:_ false

Unit test and proposed solution to follow.

And where is the problem by calling...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->captcha->render();


??

An example is illustrated in the code above; i.e. if I wanted to insert arbitrary HTML between the captcha and the captcha input.

Attached patches to Zend\_Form\_Element, \_Captcha and \_Hash.

I added a pre-render hook to the base element class, which does nothing by default. What used to be in the render() methods of the Captcha and Hash classes are transferred into the hook. I also retconned my patch for [ZF-7404].
