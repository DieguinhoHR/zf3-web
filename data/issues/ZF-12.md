### Description

Currently the memory footprint when working with fonts and images in Zend\_Pdf can be much larger than is necissary. Improvments to the stream api will allow for stream data to be stored on disk and referenced in the object representation.

This issue has been discussed at length and a lazy-load approach for larger objects is recommended, however there is some debate about the handling of smaller and transient streams.

Stakeholders, please comment on the implementation so that this issue can be planned and resolved.

I think this should be handled by alex as he wrote this part of the api, but myself or willie could complete the task.
