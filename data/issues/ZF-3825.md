ZF-3825: Apache crashes on PHP 5.2.3 if Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement is used with name 'id'

### Description

Zend Framework RC 1.7 crashes Apache if you use the following code:

$form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->setName('someFormName'); $form->addElement(new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('id')); ^^ Crash

The problem is located in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement ~109: // Set ID for element if (isset($info['attribs']['id'])) { $info['id'] = (string)$info['attribs']['id']; } }

For the code above, $info['attribs']['id'] has the value of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement and could not be casted to string. Either patch the code part with: if (isset($info['attribs']['id'])) { if (is\_object($info['attribs']['id'])) { $info['id'] = $info['attribs']['id']->\_\_toString(); } else { $info['id'] = (string)$info['attribs']['id'];

 
            }
        } 


or disallow the use of 'id' for the name-attribute in form elements. I supposed the bug exists in previous versions too.

I just used the latest svn branch with the exact same code that you posted and here is what it output in the browser

 
    <pre class="highlight">


     
    
    

Can you provide information to help support this case?

The code above now works - don't ask me why Apache crashed. BUT: The output of code is wrong:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

I just tested this against the 1.7pr release and this is what it output

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ZF Version: 1.7.0PR<br></br>

Do you have any more information on this issue? It looks like a non issue to me since it works in my testing with SVN, 1.6.2 and 1.7.0 PR.

I can not reproduce this issue. You can re-open this issue if you can provide more information and some sample code on how to reproduce it against the current release branch or the latest svn branch.
