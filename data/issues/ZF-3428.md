### Description

_Problem_ To create URIs today you have to go via the factory in Zend\_Uri, because the constructor in Zend\_Uri\_Http is protected. This creates an additional overhead that simply is not needed. The constructor in Zend\_Uri\_Http might as well be public, since most of us already know that a HTTP URI is what we want to create.

_Why make the constructor public?_

Creating it via a factory gives nothing but overhead when you know that Zend\_Uri\_Http is what you want
========================================================================================================

Auto-completion in IDEs. Zend\_Uri\_Http has a lot of methods, and looking up the API is a tedious task. To get auto-completion (PDT) you currently have to 1) create the URI using a factory in a separate method then the one you're in, then 2) store it as a property in the class, 3) use the property's docblock to indicate that it is a Zend\_Uri\_http, and 4) use this property in other methods.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

_What to look out for when making the constructor public_ Currently there is no check on $scheme in the constructor, so the following code must/should be used instead of $this->\_scheme = $scheme:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    switch ($scheme) {
        case 'http':
        case 'https':
            $this->_scheme = $scheme;
            break;
        default:
            throw new Zend_Uri_Exception("Scheme \"$scheme\" is not supported");
    }


Optionally there could be a factory method in Zend\_Uri\_Http that does the same as Zend\_Uri::factory, only the new factory method may only create Zend\_Uri\_Http (obviously). This way the constructor may be kept protected and unmodified. This approach may be used if you don't know whether the URIs you create are 'http' or 'https'.

_Consequences_

Easier to use API
=================

More friendly to IDEs
=====================

Does _not_ break backwards compatibility
========================================

Ben Scholzen has agreed to fix this if approved.

Actually, the factory pattern is only there to make the creation of objects easier (by finding the right class to use), but not to forbid the creation of those specific classes. So another factory method would be wrong in that place, we _have_ to make the constructor method public, and change it's behaviour, imho.

Well, so I suggest that the constructor can either behave like before (with two parameters), or with a single parameter (the url itself). Any suggestions on the variable naming then?

Yes. Also, since 'http' and 'https' don't make different classes, a single 'factory' method in Zend\_Uri\_Http just doesn't make sense (pattern-wise).

Another issue is that if the constructor is made public, you still would have to know if you're creating a 'http' or 'https' URI when constructing. This could be solved by creating another factory method called e.g. Zend\_Uri\_Http::fromString($uri), which would sniff out $scheme and $schemeSpecific to create the URI accordingly, and throw an exception if scheme is not 'http' or 'https'. This would be 100% backwards compatible.

I like the idea with the fromString() method. Sounds even better than making the constructor public and doesn't require to change current code. If approved I would make the neccesary changes.

Fixed with the Zend\_Uri\_Http::fromString() solution. By this, also rewrote the code to match new coding standard.
