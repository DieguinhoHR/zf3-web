I have created a work around that was suite for my need. My solution was to edit the following files:

/Zend/Pdf/Page.php /Zend/Pdf/Resource/Font/Type0.php

And combining the functions from the file unicode\_data.php that is found at TCPDF project and licensed under the GNU LGPL (<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html>)

The changes that was made in the Page.php file were to change the x1,x2 points to 595 - x1 or 595 - x2.

In the Type0.php file: call to the unicode\_data.php added new functions in order to transform the text to rtl.

for more information on this sulotion and for the edited files please contact me.
