Currently have support for: \* id selectors \* class selectors \* child selectors \* relative associations between atoms \* multiple paths (comma separated CSS selectors)

At this point, we have pretty much all we need to create XPath from CSS selectors

Branching for class selectors is now implemented and functional.
