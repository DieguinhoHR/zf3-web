### Description

Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer fails to associate with the openID provider. Tried two providers, verisign and myopenid.

The method \_associate in Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer returns false. The following condition

if (strlen($secret) != 32) { return false; }

fails and hence consumer is not able to associate with provider. When i do a var\_dump of $secret i get (length=32). but strlen doesnt return 32 making the above condition false.

Update:- I do have mbstring installed. Below is the what phpinfo shows

mbstring Multibyte Support enabled Multibyte string engine libmbfl Multibyte (japanese) regex support enabled Multibyte regex (oniguruma) version 3.7.1

mbstring extension makes use of "streamable kanji code filter and converter", which is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.

Do you have ext/mbstring installed? I suppose it might be the reason of this failure.
