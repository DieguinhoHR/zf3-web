### Description

I would like to suggest to add additional parameter to Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover::handle() method that would be passed directly to $this->\_wsdl->dump() It could be usefull for, for instance, caching purposes. You can generate wsdl file once and then just read it from file. In fact maybe it's possible to replace current parameter $request becouse it's not used.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function handle($filename = false)
    {
        if (!$filename && !headers_sent()) {
            header('Content-Type: text/xml');
        }
        $this->_wsdl->dump($filename);
    }

I added two new functions toXml() and dump($filename) which do the work. Overwriting handle() would go against the interface which might be weird to people.

Will be included in next minor release.
