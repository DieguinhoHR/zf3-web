### Description

1) There was a bug that videos with characters of 61 or more could not be validated and the video would not upload (400 error under API). This bug is now fixed as of ~1 week ago.

2) Now there is a bug that if your video title is above 60 characters it cannot be added to a playlist (another 400 validation error) Error is: 'Expected response code 200, got 400 Validation failed'
