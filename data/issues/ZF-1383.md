ZF-1383: Inconsistent exceptions thrown across adapter query() methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Upon query() failures covered by unit tests:

- Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception is thrown for PDO Mysql adapter
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception is thrown for mysqli adapter

It seems as if we should resolve the inconsistency; so that only a single catch block is written to look for for either an adapter exception a statement exception. I'll soon commit a revision that illustrates the inconsistency.

Todo: chain PDOException into Statement exception.
