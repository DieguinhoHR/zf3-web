ZF-5195: No options after disabling translation in Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hello,

disabling the translator in Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi doesn't work as intended. If I disable translation, the Options are not added to the element! Perhaps this bug has been introduced with this patch: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3457>

See here:

public function addMultiOption($option, $value = '') ....... if (!$this->\_translateOption($option, $value)) { $this->options[$option] = $value; } ......

protected function \_translateOption($option, $value) { if ($this->translatorIsDisabled()) { return true; } ......

If I fix it (return false if translator is disabled), it works again.

I agree, this is a serious bug and should be resolved for the next release. Your solution works fine, thanks!

Took me some hours to get to this bug... please fix it! (fixed it in my own install but I know I will forget about this when I update :p)

Hello,

I was gonna report this a half a year ago, but this was already posted. I almost went crazy when I upgraded to 1.8.1, but then i remembered the bug. Â¿When it's gonna be fixed?

Thanks a lot!
