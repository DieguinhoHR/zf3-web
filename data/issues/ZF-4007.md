ZF-4007: stream\_get\_contents() issue in Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Mbox.php, when mail body is empty
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-20T02:15:49.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-26T20:41:47.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Problem:

When a mail body is empty, stream\_get\_contents() gets passed a negative value (-2) as second argument (the length in bytes). According to the documentation, only positive values and -1 are defined as second argument. The mbox file was created by Mozilla Thunderbird on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 LTS.

Result:

Fatal error: Out of memory (allocated 11534336) (tried to allocate 18446744073709551615 bytes) in /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/Mail/Storage/Mbox.php on line 198

Platform:

PHP 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3 with Suhosin-Patch 0.9.6.2 (cli) (built: Jul 23 2008 06:46:18)

Workaround:

Don't pass arguments < 0 to stream\_get\_contents().

Please note: The issue still seems to exist in the svn head revision. I just checked the source and it didn't change since 1.5.1 (which comes with Ubuntu 8.04).

There must be something else wrong (too). The test file tests/Zend/Mail/\_files/test.mbox/INBOX has a message with an empty body, yet it doesn't have that problem. Could you check with that file on your platform and send me your file if the test file works?

I found a related issue but the body of my email had content in it. Albeit it had a mircosoft quote in it that may have been causing the problem

SMALL SECTION OF EMAIL (privacy constraints refrain me from submitting all)

...however, we =

=======

Running Apache 2 on localhost for testing it causes an apache crash for the file Maildir.php $content = stream\_get\_contents($fh,-1,1000);

After changing the code to the following it now works

 
        $content = '';
        while (!feof($fh)) {
            $content .= fgets($fh);
        }

Correction to the above. The following was a test for me, the correct follows

test
====

$content = stream\_get\_contents($fh,-1,1000);

live
====

@version $Id: Maildir.php 9099 2008-03-30 19:35:47Z thomas $
============================================================

$content = stream\_get\_contents($fh);

\_openMboxFile() of Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Mbox.php requires the Mbox file has CRLF on its end of lines as following.

Possibly the end of lines has only CR or LF?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strpos($line, 'From ') === 0) {
        $messagePos['end'] = ftell($this->_fh) - strlen($line) - 2; // + newline
        if (!$messagePos['separator']) {
            $messagePos['separator'] = $messagePos['end'];
        }
        $this->_positions[] = $messagePos;
        $messagePos = array('start' => ftell($this->_fh), 'separator' => 0, 'end' => 0);
    }
