ZF-9047: Problems updating config when environment is "development"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When using the environment "development", I get the following error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
           PHP Notice:  Undefined offset: 24 in Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/DbAdapter.php on line 182


Additionally, no configuration is written for that environment. Using the environment "testing" or "production" has no issues.
