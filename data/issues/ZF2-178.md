Can you please provide more specifics? At the time I removed Zend\\Controller out of the tree, I went through and ensured that no actual _code_ was still directly relying on it, including running tests. I _do_ know that Zend\\Wildfire does, but for that reason, we're not shipping it until it's refactored (though it stays in the repository as we _plan_ to refactor it).

I do know that there may be references to Zend\_Controller in the docblocks, and I have to wonder if this is the case with the specific components.

(Also, I have trouble believing that Zend\\Mvc has any references to Zend\\Controller, as it is a brand new component... ;-) )

My point is: can you provide details of failing tests, please?

The rest of components has the mentions inside of docblocks.

Not in Db, removing that tag.

Only left for update Zend\\Feed\\Pubsubhub and Zend\\Wildfire.

The first will be updated with the PR #1332 and the second with the AgileZen Story #44
