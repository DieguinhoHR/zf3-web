### Description

bq. $sQuotedValue = Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable('новое приглашение');

returns

bq. =D0=BD=D0=BE=D0=B2=D0=BE=D0=B5 =D0=BF=D1=80=D0=B8=D0=B3=D0=BB=D0=B0=D1=88= =D0=B5=D0=BD=D0=B8=D0=B5

You see there is a gap

bq. = =

which results in a broken email header.

Nothing wrong with the submission. I just mistakenly assigned it to Fabien. Nico, please re-assign to Alex V. if this is not something you can address.

I think new function of Zend\_Mail, setEncodingOfHeader() will resolve your problem.
