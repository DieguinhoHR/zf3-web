I am sorry by putting the issue here.

But the anonymous svn checkouts does not work anymore. And I could not find any documentation about any changes. Is this something temporary. If this is not te right place could you please forward me the location to ask this question

Anonymous SVN access will not go away for the foreseeable future. Occasionally it may go down, however. Please bring it up on the general mailing list if you do not have access.
