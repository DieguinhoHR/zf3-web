### Description

Catchable fatal error: Argument 1 passed to Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini::\_addBranch() must be an instance of Zend\_Config, string given, called in D:\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Config\\Writer\\Ini.php on line 119 and defined in D:\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Config\\Writer\\Ini.php on line 138.

This error is triggered when using Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini following the third example in the manual

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $writer->write( 'example.ini', $config);


Where $config is a Zend\_Config.

This happens because the code expects a section and doesn't account for no sections at all. In fact, the config _should_ have at least one section for the writer to function properly.

However, this example in the manual: "Example 7.1. Using Zend\_Config Per Se" shows us that it is possible to have configuration values that are not part of a section.

It is also possible to read config.ini files that contain no sections at all using Zend\_Config\_Ini.

I think the behavior of Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini should be the inverse of Zend\_Config\_Ini in that what you can legally read with the latter can be legally written with the first.

I will write a test with a Zend\_Config object as in Example 7.1 and see if Zend\_Config\_Ini\_Writer will write it properly. If it doesn't it should be fixed.

I attached a patch, that solves this issue and does not break the test.

I do yet have to add a test to avoid regression and I would appreciate if the community would test my patch to see if it still writes other configurations correctly.
