There are no examples in the manual either showing how to do the following example using a Zend\_Db instance using the PDO\_MYSQL adapter.

Example 3. Call a stored procedure with an INOUT parameter

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    /* Call a stored procedure with an INOUT parameter */
    $colour = 'red';
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('CALL puree_fruit(?)');
    $sth->bindParam(1, $colour, PDO::PARAM_STR|PDO::PARAM_INPUT_OUTPUT, 12);
    $sth->execute();
    print("After pureeing fruit, the colour is: $colour");
    ?>

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This example should be something found on the php.net manual and doesn't actually have anything specifically to do with Zend Framework.

"This example should be something found on the php.net manual and doesn't actually have anything specifically to do with Zend Framework."

While it is nice if there are docs on the php.net manual, doesn't the Zend\_Db have quite a different syntax to plain PHP? AFAIK, there are no "prepare", "bindParam", or "execute" functions on php.net. I think this is ZF specific? If so, please document it.

There are examples of using Zend\_Db in the ZF manual. While portions of the ZF manual are not ZF specific, they are none the less included to give the user a clearer picture of how things fit together. If you left all the SQL fragments out of the ZF manual, see how clear that would be.
