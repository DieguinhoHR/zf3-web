As noted this is related to ZF-2900

If you use a custom error handler then all errors, even suppressed ones, are sent to your error handler.

You need to check the value of error\_reporting(). If this is set to zero (0) then the error has come from a suppressed error and you need to ignore it..

I would close this issue but there seems to be a JIRA error stopping me (this has been reported to the system administrators)

best wishes, SImon
