ZF-427: Zend\_Http\_Client::get() throws out a notice
-----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-10-07T04:08:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:22.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

In certain circumstances the method Zend\_Http\_Client::get() throws out the following notice:

Notice: undefined offset: 1 in ..\\Zend\\Http\\Client.php on line 104

This notice occurs when the variable $headerValue contains no '?', for example, if $headerValue contains just '/user'. Maybe another check for the '?' should avoid this notice.

I am using the nightly build from 6/10/2006.

This is now differed in the incubator and probably will be replaced with in the next version.
