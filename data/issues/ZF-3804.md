### Description

As reported by Andy Collington:

Line 84 of Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect needs to have the fetch mode set, such as:

$result = $rowCount->query(Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ASSOC)->fetch();

Because on line 86 it assumes the results are retrieved in an array format but it's possible that someone has set the default fetch mode to be a class (as I had).
