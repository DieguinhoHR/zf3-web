ZF-2221: setGoToRoute immediately redirects to the route
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When you set a route in the redirector action helper using setGoToRoute() it immediately redirects to the route instead of waiting for a later call to redirectAndExit(). This prevents setting up the redirector using a route.

Bookkeeping. Assigning closed and resolved issues to those who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.

Setting value for default route and redirecting to this route are the same actions? 0\_o
