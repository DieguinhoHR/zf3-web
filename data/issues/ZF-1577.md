### Description

Using getDate() _sometimes_ results in notices. These lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Locale.php';
    
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('de_DE');
    $datum = '10.03.1970';
    
    $teile = Zend_Locale_Format::getDate($datum, array('date_format' => Zend_Locale_Format::STANDARD,'locale'=>$locale));
    var_dump($teile);


_sometimes_ result in this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: Undefined index: default in /Users/carsten/Sites/zf-buch/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 919
    
    Notice: Undefined index: pattern in /Users/carsten/Sites/zf-buch/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 922
    array(5) { ["date_format"]=> string(10) "dd.MM.yyyy" ["locale"]=> object(Zend_Locale)#1 (2) { ["_Locale:private"]=> string(5) "de_DE" ["_Codeset:private"]=> NULL } ["day"]=> string(2) "10" ["month"]=> string(2) "03" ["year"]=> string(4) "1970" }


The notices occur occasionally. There's probably a race condition in the code when readind the data files or something.

Please report issue with all avaiable data... Line 919 is empty... and line 922 is a closing braket.

Expecting that your problem is related to the method getDateFormat() it would mean that your CLDR files can not be read, or not always. Check if all files are installed properly. Maybe your have limited read ressources.

This error only occurs if the CLDR file for the requested locale can not be read.

Maybe your ressources are limited by the server or your php.ini file.

I made an massive test with 1000 loads and was not able to reproduce this behaviour with the code you gave. It seems the problem is not related to ZF but more to configuration or server issues.

You are free to reopen this issue if you have further informations for reproduction.
