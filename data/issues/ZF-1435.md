### Description

The default value for $noController is false for the direct method of the viewRenderer helper. I think this should be null instead.

direct() proxies setRender which has the correct default value for $noController.

If I set noController to true in my boostrap, I shouldn't have to set the value again when calling $this->\_helper->viewRender('script-name');
