ZF-4715: Having trouble inheriting from custom made elements

### Description

I created a custom element as follows:

class Custom\_Element\_TextBox extends Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text { public function init() { $this->addFilter('StringTrim') ->setAttrib('size', 20) ->setAttrib('maxLength', 45); } }

And I want to extend this class so that I could have these attributes and the filter in the child class, which is as follows:

class Custom\_Element\_TextBoxRequired extends Custom\_Element\_TextBox { public function init() { $this->setRequired(true) ->addValidator('NotEmpty', true); } }

Basically, this does not seem to be working. I feel like this is not a bug and I am just missing something here...or maybe not. Please help.

In your extending class, you need to call 'parent::init();':

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Custom_Element_TextBoxRequired extends Custom_Element_TextBox
    {
        public function init()
        {
            parent::init();
            $this->setRequired(true)
                 ->addValidator('NotEmpty', true);
        }
    }


You should probably read up on [scope resolution in PHP](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.paamayim-nekudotayim.php) -- in particular, look at example 3 on that page.
