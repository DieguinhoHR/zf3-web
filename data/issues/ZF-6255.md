### Description

The current API for working with Google apps uses deprecated HTTP requests and does not include a good portion of the functionality which is available to manipulate the Email Lists/Groups. Currently I plan to implement the ability to modify the "emailPermission" field of groups as well as add and remove owners for groups. Some other functionality may be added in as well, but I'm fairly new to this, and that's assuming I can get the things I require up and working first.

This is an important issue for us. I will likely work on this soon if noone else gets to it.

Starting today myself and a coworker cwt137 are going to begin working on this issue. Our organization (Loma Linda University) needs this API implemented properly in PHP for our priorities.

Great, glad to hear it. Is there someone with a signed CLA that I can assign this issue to?

I have a signed and approved personal CLA, but Joel and I are getting a corporate CLA signed

Joel said that the corporate CLA is signed, so I'm assigning the issue to me. Expect a big patch soon.

Attached are three patches. The code patch implements the 12 or so convince group, member, and owner methods as defined in the Google apps documentation located here: [http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/â€¦](http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/gdata_provisioning_api_v2.0_reference.html#client_lib_methods) . It also contains support code needed to make those convenience methods work. The docs patch is some simple user documentation for these convenience methods. The tests patch is all the unit tests that are needed to test the convenience methods and supporting code. I split the patch into 3 files because one patch was over 150k in size. Please have a review of the code.
