### Description

In Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo line 234 the PDOException is catched and re-returned as Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception.

In the process of this getCode() from PDOException is passed into the new exception. However its expecting an int, not a string, and fatal's on this issue.

Reproduce case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->query("SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar = ?");


This is on PHP 5.3.1
