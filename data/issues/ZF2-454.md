### Description

This is my code.

    $writer = new \Zend\Log\Writer\FirePhp();
    $logger = new \Zend\Log\Logger();
    $logger->addWriter($writer);
    
    $logger->log(1, 'test');

you have to add the firephpcore class from pear. you can do this by extending the composer.json and add it as a requirement.

this should really be noted in the reference guide.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        "repositories": [{
                "type" : "pear",
                "url" : "pear.firephp.org",
                "vendor-alias" : "firephp"
            }
        ],
        "minimum-stability": "dev",
        "require": {
            "php": ">=5.3.3",
            "zendframework/zendframework": "2.*",
            "firephp/FirePHPCore" : "*"
        }
