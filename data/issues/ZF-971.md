### Description

The Zend\_Filter\_Input class is deprecated in favor of the new object-oriented implementation of Zend\_Filter, but the documentation of Zend\_Filter\_Input is still in the tree and being rendered by the DocBook manual index.

Please remove the documentation for the deprecated class and eliminate it from the DocBook render.
