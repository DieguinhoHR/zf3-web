ZF-653: sub() always returns timestamp of object

### Description

I am trying to determine using Zend\_Date if one date is earlier or later than another. They are both valid dates (both display correctly when the object is printed). However, the sub() method always returns the timestamp of the first object.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I've tried many different ways.

It should work like

$date->sub($otherdate)

But as you may have recognised I am unit testing the whole date framework since several days. sub() has not been approved by unit tests until now...

So it is possible that this function is bogus as it is not tested for now.

Assigning to Thomas. Scheduling for 0.7.

sub() always returns the subed part of the date.

Example:

$date = new Zend\_Date(3,Zend\_Date::DAY); // day 3rd jan 1970 print "\\nORIGINAL:".$date->get(Zend\_Date::W3C); // 03.jan.1970 print "\\nRETURN:".$date->sub(1,Zend\_Date::DAY); // 1 day minus // returns 2 because 2nd Jan 1970 print "\\nAFTER:".$date->get(Zend\_Date::W3C); // 01.jan.1970

So sub() always returnes the new part of the date that was subed. In our example DAY.
