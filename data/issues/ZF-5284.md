### Description

It'd be nice if I could configure a default route type so that I didn't have to specify type for each route when I'm using the same route type for dozens of routes.

API is simple:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->setDefaultRouteType('Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex');


Default would of course be Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route.
