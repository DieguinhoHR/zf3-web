### Description

I had options in zend\_filter\_input which contained more default namespaces. Upgrading to 1.0.4 broke my unit tests because of namespace becoming inputNamespace. I've changed the problem in my code. The docs should be changed or backwards compatibility should be kept.

The real problem is, that the documentation is not up to date: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.input.html#zend.filter.input.namespaces) It still uses "namespace", but it should be "inputNamespace".
