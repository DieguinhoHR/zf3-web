Zend\_Form currently doesn't prevent bad guys from submitting forms filled with "bad" values (not being part of the available options).

Kind regards, Thomas Gelf

Quick & dirty patch.

A more elegant variant would be overriding getValidatorChain(), adding some kind of Zend\_Validate\_IsArrayKey(). As the latter doesn't exist (and as I'm really lazy) I have chosen the approach shown in the attached patch file.

Cheers, Thomas

Please post this to the mailing list fw-mvc@lists.zend.com, and not the issue tracker. Zend\_Form is in its very early stages, and not even approved as a proposal yet; sharing this on list will illicit maximum discussion during the development phase of this component.

Done, sent through gmane ([http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.zend.frameâ€¦](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.zend.framework.mvc/2035)). I hope it will find it's way to the right destination (Nabble??)...
