Need to finish testing. It's possible now to test all accessors, but it would be good to have a service against which I can instantiate a SoapClient instance to ensure that the object can be created successfully.

Alex, please take a look at the SOAP components and let me know if you will be able to complete them with Matthew's help in time for 1.5 RC1.
