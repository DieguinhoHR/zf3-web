### Description

Hello,

this one is a duplicate of ZF-2881 , wich have been closed, but the issue subsists.

The decodeGzip uses _gzinflate_ instead of _gzuncompress_, and the decodedeflate uses _gzuncompress_ instead of _gzinflate_ . Maybe tests files in \_files/response\_gzip and \_files/response\_deflate has been inverted ?

Best regards,

Hi,

Have you encountered any real problems, and if so can you please provide a test case? All my reading and tests - not only unit tests, but also tests against real servers, have shown (when originally writing the Http\_Client, and when double checking for ZF-2881) that this is the correct way to do it.

Thanks,

Shahar.

The problems comes first when trying to interact with the Transmission daemon, under Linux. This one send me headers that seems to be uncompatible with Zend\_Http\_Client and the data of this response.

Content-Encoding : deflate

I'll try to keep an eye on it, and maybe submit a fix as soon as I can, If I finally determine that this bug is not Transmission related.

Cheers

Finally, it seems to be a Transmission Issue, and not a Zend one ([http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2188/â€¦](http://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/2188#comment:8))

Hope this helps someones. Thanks,

Alexis

So I understand for now no change is required in Zend\_Http? If so please resolve, if not please update.

BTW You should be able to set the "Accept-Encoding" header to 'identity' when sending your request so that the server will know not to use any compression. Of course, if the server is buggy it might ignore that..

Shahar.

Yes. Issue resolved. Sorry, but I don't see any link or button to set this bug report as invalid.
