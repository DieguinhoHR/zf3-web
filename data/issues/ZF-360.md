ZF-360: Cache IDs are validated unnecessarily
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2006-09-08T20:13:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I see get() calls \_validateIdOrTag($id) each time, which calls preg\_match. I think it's unnecessary slowdown - if you call it on set(), there's no chance wrong ID would end up in cache. Since get() is much more performance-critical than save(), we might want to drop validation there.

For security reasons, particulary with the File backend, I prefer keep this (little) slowdown than taking a risk of nasty things (even with get())

sorry :(

Can you explain what nasty things you are talking about? And why specific backend can't take care of it if it needs to?

For example :

- if the cache id is taken from an url like "foo.php?id=bar"

AND

- if you use the File backend

AND

- if you call a get($\_GET['id'])

maybe if a craker play with URL like

foo.php?id=../../../../etc/passwd

it could be possible to get a security problem

To be honnest, I don't want to deal with things like that in the File backend. So tag and cache id (which are used to make the cache filename) must be safe and filtered by the Core

Same thing with the Sqlite backend. I don't want SQL injection problems even if the real error (get a cache id from $\_GET without a solid filter) is not in Zend\_Cache.

OK, but then if you need something like checking if there's only alphanumeric characters there won't it be faster to use something like strspn/strcspn?

I don't know but if you make some benchs, I'm really interested in the results :-)

OK, I did some tests, and indeed strspn is about twice as fast as preg, but there's a catch - AFAIK there's no function that returns "if there are characters not from this list" - strspn returns length of correct string, which has to be compared to length of the original, and this means another function call, which eats up all speedup achieved by strspn. So unless there's some clever function that can do "check if there's only these chars in a string" with one fcall without regexp - preg\_match is the best.

nice work :-) even results are not good for now :-(
