ZF-5553: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect - setting multiple="multiple" by switch

### Description

public function formSelect($name, $value = null, $attribs = null, $options = null, $listsep = "  
\\n") { ... $multiple = ''; if (substr($name, -2) == '[]') { // multiple implied by the name $multiple = ' multiple="multiple"'; }

Adding "multiple" should be done by some parameter, whose default settings could be like actual one. In my ZF application I add comboboxes with the name of "itemcategory[]" by javascript. So I have multiple dropdown comboboxes and I manage their behaviour by some nice buttons and user have better user experience than if he had to press ctrl+ list with all the list.

Zend framework shouldn't stop programmer to make such a behaviour. There should be some switch, which I am able to set to "false" - with means of: "don't add multiple attribute if you find [] in the name".

You _can_ specify the 'multiple' option via the $attribs array (third argument):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->formSelect('foo', '', array('multiple' => 'multiple'));


However, this implicitly adds the array notation ('[]') to the element name when you do. The rationale is that ZF will not be able to handle the submitted values if the array notation is not in place. I consider it a fringe case that you would _not_ want this, and feel the code to support it would introduce undue complexity to the helper.

If you do not want this behavior, override the FormSelect view helper by extending it locally and ensuring that your helper prefix is registered.
