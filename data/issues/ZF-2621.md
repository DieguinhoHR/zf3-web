Added due date of 2008-02-20 under assumption that this is must-have. I think this one probably should be a "should-have," rather than a must-have.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This should probably not be an issue in the first place. Also, I accidentally assigned this and didn;t know how else to close this ^^
