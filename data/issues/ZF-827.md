### Description

Any applications must installable on existing systems and have only one database for use. So this applications have to use & create uniqe table names.

I think it is useful to set table prefix on createing the db adapter und the select object can complete the given table names with the prefix

e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = array('tprefix'=>'tprefix_', ... );
    $db = new Zend_Db('pdo_mysql', $params);
    $select = $db->select();
    $select->from('table', '*');
    echo $select->__toString();
    // SELECT * FROM `tprefix_table`

Also see ZF-1017, which is a similar feature request for Zend\_Db\_Table.

This is best done in user-land. That is, an application that requires to "share" a database by prefixing its table names should code it as part of the application. It's not something we choose to support in the Zend Framework.
