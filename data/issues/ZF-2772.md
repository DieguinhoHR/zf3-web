ZF-2772: Submit buttons show wrong text...

### Description

Hello,

I just upgraded from 1.5.0PR to 1.5.0RC1. I noticed quite quickly that the submit buttons in forms don't seem to display the right text.

Here's some code that I have in a sub-classed Zend\_Form constructor:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $eSubmit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('login');
    $eSubmit->setValue('Click to Login');


When the form is rendered, the following is output: ````

I haven't put a huge deal of time into trying to figure this one out, but it seems straightforward enough to me. So, I'm pretty sure it's a legitimate issue. Whatever the case, it should be easy enough for others to reproduce.

Thanks,

Travis

A lot changed between the PR and RC1. One of these was how the submit button (as well as reset and button) element works.

The element label is now used as the value. The rationale behind this is that the label is what is _displayed_ to the end-user. It also provides us with the ability to ensure that what is submitted is actually what we set for the label -- allowing you now call $submit->isClicked() on your various button elements to create a decision tree.

This functionality is now documented, albeit only in the subversion repository.

Hi Matthew,

Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it. I went and changed from setValue() to setLabel() and all's good, just like you said.

Perhaps you can help me out....is there a change log somewhere that points out the changes from PR to RC1...? The main download page's changelog link doesn't yield anything. :-|

Also, I had what I thought was the RC1 docs, but it seems that you're saying that the setLabel() functionality is documented in the subversion repository. Is that what I get if I download the latest snapshot?

Thanks again,

Travis
