### Description

After updating from ZendFramework Version 1.6 to 1.6.1 this message occours.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: No translation for the language 'de_DE' available. in...


Reproducable only if I manually set the locale

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $translate->setLocale(Zend_Registry::get(J3k_Registry::LOCALE)->toString());


Affects the gettext Adapter!

Just forget to say that the right language files are used and translated! It's just the message...

As you can see, this is no failure, but a notice. This is a new feature which has been requested.

A notice is in this case the correct behaviour, because otherwise users wont see why their language is not translated. The code still works without changes, but the notice shows you that your user requested a language you have not actually available in your sources.
