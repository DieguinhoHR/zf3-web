ZF-5207: connect to PDO OCI with Zend\_Db

### Description

I am using the Oracle Instant Client connecting to a remote RAC database. The RAC system has multiple hosts. TNSnames.ora entry needs "LOADBALANCE clouth", "FAILOVER clouth", hostnames. Therefore current PDO OCI module makes RAC TNSnames.ora entry too hard. Simply using "oci:dbname=mydb" (ZF1.0.3), I can connect RAC database. I think PDO OCI module must contain both functions (1.0.3 + 1.7.0). \* RAC = Real Application Cluster

Can you try with ZF1.8? There are some changes on pdo\_oci between 1.7 and 1.8.

I tried it with 1.8.0. I confirmed that RAC database connection was normal.

You can tell me why you think to change the entry? It would fix some trouble or bring any benefit?

It seems to be pdo\_oci extension issue . If you use Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle (this uses oci8 extension) instead of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci, you could use RAC feature easier than now.

So, I think it would be closed.
