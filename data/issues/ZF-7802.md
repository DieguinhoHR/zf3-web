### Description

Per the Interface definition and the documentation, setClass() allows an object to be supplied. Passing an object, however, gives the following error:

Zend\_Soap\_Server\_Exception: Invalid class argument (object) in /usr/share/zend-framework/ZendFramework-1.9.2-minimal/library/Zend/Soap/Server.php on line 560

There is a function "setObject" just for this, it seems the docs are wrong on this issue then.
