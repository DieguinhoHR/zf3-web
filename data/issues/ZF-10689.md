### Description

excuse me! I use zf configure for creating db files based on this tutorial : [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.create-model.html)

and i executed this command :
-----------------------------

 zf configure db-adapter "adapter=oracle&dbname=APPLICATION\_PATH \\"/../data/db/korosh.db\\"" -s production
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but zf command line tool response to me :

###### \#

A db configuration for the production section has been written to the application config file.

###### \#

i created data/db directories . but zf do not create db files in those directories too i search for other solution for create db file such as use zend studio but not found any thing .  
 can i use Zend ORM(Table Data Gateway and DataMapper pattern) with simple connection that create by Zend\_Db::factory('oracle',$param)

I do not use db file with ORM . ????????????????

You have specified oracle as the driver, instead of the pdo\_sqlite as specified in the quickstart.

oracle would not be expected to create a datafile, as it is a server based rdbms, and not file based as sqlite is.

For support, could you direct questions to the mailing list, or #zftalk on freenode irc?
