ZF-3979: GET/POST values leak between test cases
------------------------------------------------

### Description

Setting get or post values and not resetting them afterwards will leak the values to subsequent tests. This appears to be because the HttpTestCase request methods set values in $\_POST and $\_GET, and later on, the new instances of the request load the old values from the superglobals.

I think it would make more sense if the $\_POST/$\_GET values would not persist between tests. This may also affect $\_COOKIE, but I haven't tested that.

This bug is a real show-stopper if you're running multiple controller test within one run and you must rely on clean request contexts. For example I'm using a preDispatch() plugin that loads model entities and persits them inside the request object with $request->setParam('xy', ...). There are cases when there is no model entity to be set (entity not found), so I check for if (!$this->\_getParam('xy')) in my controller to forward to a 404-page. No problem so far. I also run tests on my authentication controller where I set the request data inside my test method with $this->getRequest()->setPost(array( [...], 'xy' => 'someValue', [...]));. 'someValue' is no persisted throughout the complete test run inside the $\_POST global array, so the controller test in which the controller uses if (!$this->\_getParam('xy')) does not work anymore if this test is executed after the authentication tests because the 'xy' param does not contain a model instance but rather the string 'someValue' from a previous test run on an authentication controller test.

Either Zend\_Controller\_Request\_HttpTestCase should use an internal array to store $\_GET and $\_POST data, which could easily be resetted by creating a new request instance, or Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase must issue a

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $_GET=array();
    $_POST=array();


in its setUp() method.

I didn't do any tests with cookies so I cannot comment on if there is a problem with $\_COOKIE too.

Fixed in trunk and 1.6 release branch; $\_GET, $\_POST, $\_COOKIE, and $\_SESSION are all reset during reset() now.

Fix will ship with 1.6.1.
