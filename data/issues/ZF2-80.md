### Description

Please remove _require\_once_ from class _Zend\\Controller\\Router\\Rewrite_ on line 97. It forces the include\_path to contain the Zend Framework.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function addDefaultRoutes()
        {
            if (!$this->hasRoute('application')) {
                $dispatcher = $this->getFrontController()->getDispatcher();
                $request = $this->getFrontController()->getRequest();
    
                require_once 'Zend/Controller/Router/Route/Module.php';
                $compat = new Route\Module(array(), $dispatcher, $request);
    
                $this->_routes = array_merge(array('application' => $compat), $this->_routes);
            }
    
            return $this;
        }


Affected Version: 2.0.0beta1

Zend\\Controller is old MVC port from ZF1. Look the new Mvc component and Zend\\Mvc\\Router subnamespace for ZF2 beta1. So priority major is wrong.

How do you want use ZF in app without have ZF in the include path?

sorry, setting major priority was an error.

I thought thats the intention of _Zend\\Loader\\StandardAutoloader_ as the constructor contains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->registerNamespace('Zend', dirname(__DIR__));

The question is: how do you get the standard autoloader in the first place? You have to have it either on your include\_path or require it by a known path in the first place. :)

yes, you're right, it doesn't really matter. But currently ZendFramework chooses, not the user.

_Zend\\Application\\Application_ requires the StandardAutoloader by absolute path in his constructor:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../Loader/StandardAutoloader.php';


So you just have to know the absolute path to Zend\\Application\\Application. Thats the way i prefer to use ZendFramwork or other libraries (e.g. Doctrine), because i use a shared library path for all projects/services with following directory structure:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /path/to/library
        /dynamic
            /Doctrine
                /2.1.1
                /2.1.2
            /ZendFramework
                /1.11.10
                /1.11.11
                /2.0.0beta1


For ZF 1.x i have to use set\_include\_path, in 2.x not necessarily.

But as i said: it doesn't matter, so it doesn't bother me, if resolution will be _won't fix_ :-)

Zend\\Controller has been removed from the mainline ZF2 distribution in favor of a new MVC (Zend\\Mvc). A module providing a ZF1-compatible MVC layer can be found in [modules/ZendFramework1Mvc](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/modules/ZendFramework1Mvc)
