### Description

Very similar to issue ZF-7856 which was resolved in version 1.9.4. When loading certain HTML ([http://starfruit.champlain.edu/~huwiler/â€¦](http://starfruit.champlain.edu/~huwiler/loadHTML-bug.html) contains the html that produces this error), the following fatal error is produced:

Fatal error: Call to a member function removeChild() on a non-object in /Users/huwilerm/Sites/Search/library/Zend/Search/Lucene\\ /Document/Html.php on line 117

As with ZF-7856, commenting out the line causing trouble (117: $head->parentNode->removeChild($head);) seems to fix this issue...
