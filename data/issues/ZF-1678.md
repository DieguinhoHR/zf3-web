ZF-1678: ViewRenderer neverRender flag has no effect

### Description

As reported on fw-mvc by Fred Wolf, the neverRender flag -- set either in the constructor, via setOptions(), or via setNeverRender(), has no effect; auto-rendering continues to occur.

I have verified that postDispatch() does not check the flag's value prior to rendering, and it should.
