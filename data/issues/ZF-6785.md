ZF-6785: Inconsistencies in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::toArray() and ::setFromArray()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-22T18:41:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:55.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The data returned by the toArray() function does not use getter methods that may have been set up, but setFromArray() does use the setter methods. As a result, while the following code can be perfectly valid for copying a property from one row object to another:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rowObj1->prop1 = $rowObj2->prop1


This code can fail:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rowObj1->setFromArray($rowObj2->toArray());


Specific example - Suppose prop1 is serialized before being written to the database, and the model contains the following functions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setProp1($value) {
        $this->set('prop1', serialize($value));
    }
    
    public function getProp1() {
        return unserialize($this->get('prop1'));
    }


On $rowObj1, the property prop1 would be serialized twice after running $rowObj1->setFromArray($rowObj2->toArray()).

I suspect the correct solution is to have toArray() use any getter methods that may have been set up.
