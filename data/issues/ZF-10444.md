ZF-10444: Error logging
-----------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2010-09-11T13:00:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:38:12.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

A really great security feature of the Zend\_Amf is the proper error handling and the error message omission in the production mode, but when in production there might be some unexpected exceptions thrown by the very Zend Framework.

Usually, when the application is in production, there are users that do something wrong and suddenly for them "the application does not work" and end users are best known for their debugging capabilities (yeah right!).

Anyway, my proposal is to add a method on Zend\_Amf\_Server named "setExceptionLogger" which will go as follow:

//// Begin PHP code //// public function setExceptionLogger(Zend\_Log $exceptionLogger) { $this->\_exceptionLogger = $excpetionLogger; return $this; } //// End PHP code ////

and used inside method "\_errorMessage" as follows:

//// Begin PHP code //// protected function \_errorMessage($objectEncoding, $message, $description, $detail, $code, $line) { if($this->\_exceptionLogger!==null){ $this->\_exceptionLogger->log($message, Zend\_Log::ERR); }

...

} //// End PHP code ////

This would help a lot in debugging applications, specially on production mode where we want to handle Exceptions without compromising the application.
