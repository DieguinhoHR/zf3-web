### Description

Hi, recently I started using zendAMF as an alternative to phpamf however I have a problem I'm not able to resolve. I have a php service class that returns an array of objects each of which has a different property list. When I use the zendAMF to translate the php result to flash/flex all the objects are translated to have the same properties.

For example the first object has properties X and Y, and the second has X and Z. When the array with these two objects passes through zendAMF I get the following response on the flash side - first object has properties X and Y, and the second object also has properties X and Y. So the Z property is lost and the Y property is added to the second object as NULL.

Please can you advise/solve this problem since it is a major issue for me.

Here is how I find the issue, I dump the array of object using php and I access it using the zamfbrowser and a flex app. The php dump shows the right contents without the problem described above, however when I open it using zamfbrowser the problem appears.
