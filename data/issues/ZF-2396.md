ZF-2396: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci wrong quoting for single-quotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-01-08T12:23:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-10-10T14:41:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.2 (13/Oct/08)

### Description

The \_quote function in the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci quotes single-quotes with addcslashes. This is wrong since oracle requires a single-quote to be escaped with another single-quote and not a backslash. Please use the \_quote() function from Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle for quoting since there is it correct.

Thanks

We tested the resolution in the bug description. This fixes the broken oci adapter.

I wonder why this is not fixed yet? This allows for SQL injection if people use the PDO\_OCI adapter and rely on \_quote() to work as advertised! The fix is so easy and already accepted in the regular Oracle adapter so please can someone commit the fix?

I have problems like this using Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable with Oracle Express and I created a patch to this in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci.

Fixed in SVN11672 (applies same quoting as Oracle adapter). Fix test failure testSelectColumnWithColonQuotedParameter.
