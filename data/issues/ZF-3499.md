ZF-3499: helper="formMultiCheckbox" being added to fieldset
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I've created a Zend\_Form and added a Zend\_Form\_Element\_MultiCheckbox element to it with the following decorators: ViewHelper, Fieldset. When using setLegend on the Fieldset decorator the HTML output is something like below:

... snip ...

<

fieldset id="testMulti" helper="formMultiCheckbox">

 test legend ... snip ...

helper is not a valid attribute and I believe it is being added to the fieldset tag errantly.
