### Description

Implement a Marker Interface Pattern for the UiWidgetElement Decorator, that is in UiWidgetElement Form Elements we have to add a function "\_checkWidgetMarkerInterface" that iterates over the decorators and throws an exception when no decorator with the UiWidgetElement marker interface is found (which leads to the concolusion that someone might try to use the ViewHelper for rendering, which does not work).

Will be implemented in 1.8 and constitute a small BC break, since current implementations that overwrite the ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Decorator\_UiWidgetElement have to also implement the ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Decorator\_UiWidgetElementMarker interface.
