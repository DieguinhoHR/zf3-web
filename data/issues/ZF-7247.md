ZF-7247: Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase can't dispatch the same action twice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When I dispatch the action the first time the response object contains the html output, but on subsequent calls $this->request->outputBody() is empty. I've tried calling $this->reset() between calls but it doesn't seem to help. I'm not sure what is causing this error but it sure is annoying.

First, a request object doesn't contain any response information, double check before submitting it as an issue please. And when you submit something, provide us your test to see what your intentions are. Otherwise it's hard for us to verify the issue.

Secondly, a quick test shows this is not an issue, not with the current version of ZF (1.10.6), nor with ZF-1.8.1

/\*\* \* @group ZF-7247 \* @example page contains only

Test

 
     */
    public function testRequestBodyCanBeCalledMoreThanOnce()
    {
        $this->dispatch('/');
        $this->assertQueryCount('p#test', 1);
        $this->assertQueryCount('p.test', 1);
        $this->assertQueryContentContains('p', 'Test');
        for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
            $this->assertEquals('<p id="test" class="test">Test</p>', $this->response->getBody());
        }
        for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
            $this->assertEquals('<p id="test" class="test">Test</p>', $this->getResponse()->getBody());
        }
    }
