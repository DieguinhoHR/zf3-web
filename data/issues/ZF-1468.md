### Description

I would like to see a way to filter/validate parameters using standard php functions and static methods in addition to the Zend\_Filter, Zend\_Validator and Custom\_\* namespaces using call\_user\_func\_array().

examples:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $filters = array( 
        // call_user_func_array('intval', array($month));
        'month'   => 'intval', 
        // call_user_func_array('trim', array($name));
        'name'    => 'trim',   
    ); 
    
    $validators = array( 
        'month'   => array(
            'ctype_digits',
        ),
        'user' => array(
            // call_user_func_array(array('UserModel' => 'checkUserId'), array($user)); -> UserModel::checkUserId($user);
            'UserModel' => 'checkUserId' 
        )
    );


Yes I know that there are good Zend\_\* wrappers available for several php functions, but maybe call\_user\_func\_array could safe some object instantiation overhead; although it self needs some microseconds to execute. But it would enable nice possibilities for validations as shown with the UserModel example, that you would call and check later in your script anyway, so you really would have all checks and treatments in one place.

The design of Zend\_Filter\_Input requires that filters refer to classes that extend Zend\_Filter\_Interface, and validators refer to classes that extend Zend\_Validate\_Interface.

The value of this is that these interface define the calling convention. There is a filter() method and an isValid() method that Zend\_Filter\_Input knows to call.

In addition, validators return error messages, which the ad hoc solution you describe would not allow.

If you have custom filter or validation methods, you should write a class that implements Zend\_Filter\_Interface or extends Zend\_Validate\_Abstract. Then name these classes in your Zend\_Filter\_Input rules.

It's really not likely that instantiating a single object per filter or validator is a significant issue for performance.
