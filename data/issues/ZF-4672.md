ZF-4672: Cache ID validation should occur by the cache backend
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-10-21T13:47:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-10-27T11:52:33.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently, Zend\_Cache\_Core performs cache ID validation and only allows [a-zA-Z0-9\_], whilst cache backends such as memcached can support cache IDs with other characters (e.g. dashes and colons).

This issue becomes a problem, for example, if a developer wanted to share sessions via memcached with a Ruby on Rails application which supports and writes it's cache IDs with colon characters. So I imagine that this issue could potentially be a block whenever trying to utilize cache data written by applications that allow all the cache ID characters (aside from [a-zA-Z0-9\_]) supported by a specific caching backend.

sharing cache records with other applications (without the same version of Zend\_Cache) is completly unsupported

cache records do not contain only data but also metadatas (which are specific to Zend\_Cache)

the format of storage is an internal thing
