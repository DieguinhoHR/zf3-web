ZF-6521: Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini adds anti-slashes to strings
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-04T09:51:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-12-17T17:52:25.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini adds anti-slashes to strings when it writes data into files the same as does Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Array. but it encloses the string in " " quotes.

Once you read the file, strings remain escaped with anti-slashes and you have to parse your Zend\_Config object.

Workaround : in Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini function's \_prepareValue(), don't parse strings with addslashes().

Hope report correct and appropriate. its my first.

When reading an .ini file with parse\_ini\_file(), all double quotes - escaped or not - are removed: so str"ing becomes string and str\\"ing becomes str\\ing.

Talked with Ben about this, removing the addslashes() and throwing an Exception when a double quote is inside the stored value.

double quotes in value may cause .ini file incorrect.

--- reproduct code: ---

require\_once 'Zend/Config/Writer/Ini.php'; require\_once 'Zend/Config/Ini.php';

$data = array( 'testKey' => 'test"quotes', 'nextKey' => 'blah,blah,blah...', ); $file = 'test.ini';

$config = new Zend\_Config($data); // write $options = array('config' => $config , 'filename' => $file); $writer = new Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini($options); $writer->write();

// read $config = new Zend\_Config\_Ini($file); var\_dump($config->toArray());

--- expect result --- array(2) { ["testKey"]=> string(10) "testquotes" ["nextKey"]=> string(17) "blah,blah,blah..." }

--- actual result --- array(1) { ["testKey"]=> string(39) "test\\quotes nextKey = blah,blah,blah..." }
