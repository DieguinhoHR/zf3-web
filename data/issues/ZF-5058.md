### Description

If you perform the Optimizations from the Documentation by stripping out all require\_once statements ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html) C.2.2.1) the Zend\_Locale\_Math Class will fail if the bcmath Extension is not loaded, since it is trying to wrap the bcmath functions into php functions as a fallback for the missing extension.

This is not really a bug per se but it should be noted somehow inside the Documentation that removing the require statements of some components might cause negative sideeffects.
