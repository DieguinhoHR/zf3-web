ZF-3849: Zend\_Form\_Element::getValidator($name) - format of $name has changed

### Description

In ZF1.5 the following works:

$element->getValidator('Zend\_Validate\_StringLength');

in ZF1.6RC1 this returns false, the following must be used instead:

$element->getValidator('stringLength');

It seems to be related to a refactoring that changed the Validators to lazy-load, but the older syntax should be made to work.

Mixing short and long names is a bad use case; elements added using short names could resolve to a user-defined plugin, in which case pulling by the full class name would not work. Lazy loading actually fixes this behavior, as it forces the developer to drop the assumption that the short name resolves to a specific class name.

We will not revert the behavior.
