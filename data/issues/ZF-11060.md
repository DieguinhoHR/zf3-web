ZF-11060: Zend\_Uri\_Http disallows pipe character (|) in URIs
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The method valid of the Zend\_Uri\_Http class that is on line 276, doesn't validade the following URL:

[http://mt1.googleapis.com/vt/â€¦](http://mt1.googleapis.com/vt?lyrs=m@144&src=apiv3&hl=en-US&apistyle=s.t:3%7Cs.e:l%7Cp.v:off&x=5&y=8&z=4&s=Galileo)

If I made a little correction on line 48 from: const CHAR\_RESERVED = ';\\/?:@&=+$,'; to: const CHAR\_RESERVED = ';\\/?:@&=+$,|';

Then the url, validates.

Tnks in advance.

I've moved | from CHAR\_UNWISE to CHAR\_MARK and updated the test suite to reflect change

Fixed in trunk r23942

This is not an issue. The pipe character (according to the URI RFC should be encoded and is not a valid character).

Commit was backed out of trunk in r23979.

I ran into the same issue for the # character, wondering if an issue exists on this one too.

@Mickael, as you can see this bug is resolved as 'not an issue', so no, by definition the same issue does not exist :P

If you can describe exactly what you are trying to do and how it fails, it will help.

Please note that the '#' symbol is not allowed in an unencoded form in any URL part, except for in the fragment part - for example it cannot be a part of the path or the query string. If you want to use it in a path or a query string, you must urlencode() it first.
