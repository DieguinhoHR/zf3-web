### Description

Hi,

I'm using a view (MVC setup) compounded of : - a dijit.Tooltip div rendered using pure html markup (since there is no Zend View helper for this at the moment) - a Zend\_Dojo\_Form with some Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element : Button, ValidationTextBox, etc. - a single dijit.form.ValidationTextBox rendered with pure html (for testing purpose)

While rendering this view in a browser (FF3) : - none of the form elements gets its html template applied. Firebug shows that requests are made to retrieve javascript modules for each element (ValidationTextBox.js, ComboBox.js), but I CAN'T see any request concerning their templates (ValidationTextBox.html, ComboBox.html) - the single dijit.form.ValidationTextBox is correctly rendered

If I delete the tooltip div, everything is rendered correctly and Firebug shows that requests are made to retrieve widgets html templates.

Dojo is 1.3.1

I would be happy to provide any other informations as needed.

It seems to be duplicate of ZF-7231.
