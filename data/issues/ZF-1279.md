Matthew is working on some documentation reorganization for the Controller component, so it's likely that he has some work still unfinished.

Assigning this issue to Matthew so he remembers to do "make check" when he's done, and also a reminder that the DocBook element requires a nested element.

All issues were fixed for the 0.9.3 release.
