### Description

If AMF service returns a resource, it is possible to create a class that would serialize this resource into some form acceptable for AMF client. However, if the object is returned, there is no possibility of creating generic transformations for certain classes. This may be useful if the object returned is something like Mysqli\_Result - i.e. useless if passed as "properties bag" but having some algorithm that would allow to serialize it into some other form.
