ZF-6831: Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http\_Resolver\_File different behavior on Windows and Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When I create a list of credentials in Windows machine, my file has \\r at the end of each line

When this file later is parsed on Linux server, every password has \\r at the end. And authentication fails.

I suggest to change line 158 in Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http\_Resolver\_File to this line:

 
                $password = rtrim($line[2], "\r");


This will resolve the problem and won't hurt existing users. I can't imagine that anyone may have a password with \\r at the end.
