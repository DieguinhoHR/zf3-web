### Description

I have found cases that some records has missed in return to a search with two or more strings with AND criteria (even using generic search API); I've traced into the code and found the following facts:

1. the score of a MultiTerm search becomes zero (the terms when searched separately can return results, i.e. score > 0)
2. some of the $this->\_termsFreqs[$termId][$docId] using in the for loop of member function "\_conjunctionScore" is null and caused $reader->getSimilarity()->tf($this->\_termsFreqs[$termId][$docId]) [MultiTerm.php line 473] to return 0
3. the "used" $docsFilter created in [MultiTerm.php line 330] in member function "\_calculateConjunctionResult" caused the last loop for the termFreqs failed to be assigned values

As I have only limited time for reverse engine, I can't fully understand the use of "DocsFilter" at the moment, I am wondering whether this can be corrected by simply modify the member function as follows:

 
    private function _calculateConjunctionResult(Zend_Search_Lucene_Interface $reader)
    {
        $this->_resVector = null;
    
        if (count($this->_terms) == 0) {
            $this->_resVector = array();
        }
    
        // Order terms by selectivity
        $docFreqs = array();
        $ids      = array();
        foreach ($this->_terms as $id => $term) {
            $docFreqs[] = $reader->docFreq($term);
            $ids[]      = $id; // Used to keep original order for terms with the same selectivity and omit terms comparison
        }
        array_multisort($docFreqs, SORT_ASC, SORT_NUMERIC,
                        $ids,      SORT_ASC, SORT_NUMERIC,
                        $this->_terms);
    
        $docsFilter = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_DocsFilter();
        foreach ($this->_terms as $termId => $term) {
            $termDocs = $reader->termDocs($term, $docsFilter);
        }
        // Treat last retrieved docs vector as a result set
        // (filter collects data for other terms)
        $this->_resVector = array_flip($termDocs);
    
        $docsFilter = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_DocsFilter();                                               // <---------------------- added to re-initialize the $docsFilter
        foreach ($this->_terms as $termId => $term) {
            $this->_termsFreqs[$termId] = $reader->termFreqs($term, $docsFilter);
    
        }
    
    }

Reinitialising the DocsFilter as mentioned here solves the Undefined offset notice from issue ZF-5545 for me. Although I don't understand how/if this influences search result. It seems to me, although I don't understand the issue fully, that with this fix the function $reader->termFreqs has to redo some work because it does not have the Docfilter data from the previous $reader->termDoc calls
