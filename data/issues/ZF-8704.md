### Description

This feature mentioned in the manual seems to be missing:

You may additionally specify a class for the tag using the class option or by calling setClass(); by default, the class 'hint' is used. (23.7.3. Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Description)

Calling

$form->getDecorator("Description")->setClass('success');

results in

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Description::setClass()

You are right, that is written in the manual, however the method is missing. What works is $form->getDecorator("Description")->setOption('class','success'); My opinion is, that it is more economical to update the Documentation.
