Result of mysql\_query is a PHP resource. It is not possible to export the result of PHP resource outside of PHP. You could fetch the data contained there and return it, but not the resource itself.

I think I understand what is meant in this issue - functionality to create adapter which would extract data from particular type of resource. Should be improvement, not bug.
