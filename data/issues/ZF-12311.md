ZF-12311: Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Files sets incorrect HTTP headers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-06-29T16:10:31.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-07-06T10:01:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The values of the constants HEADER\_CONTENT\_TYPE, HEADER\_LAST\_MODIFIED, HEADER\_CONTENT\_LENGTH have the wrong case - ie "Content-type" not "Content-Type". As a result you cannot actually set the content type (it's always set to 'application/json' by Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Abstract::httpCall(), which checks for the existence of the correctly cased header).

In addition METADATA\_OBJECT\_HEADER and METADATA\_CONTAINER\_HEADER should also be ucfirst (according to the API docs, don't know if it matters).
