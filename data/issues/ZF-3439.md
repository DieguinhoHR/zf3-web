### Description

This specific bug relates to the Zend\_Translate TMX Adapter. It may also apply to other XML translation adapters.

It appears from a cursory test that the Adapter's use of xml\_parser\_create() creates a situation where in the incoming character encoding of the source input, is transferred to UTF-8 when output. This behaviour is enabled by default and documented in the PHP manual.

As a result ISO-8859-1 diacritics in the input source are transformed into their equivelant double-byte UTF-8 counterparts (i.e. the base character + diacritic). This breaks translations using ISO-8859-1 diacritics in the TMX XML format, when the HTML output is sent to the client browser using an ISO-8859-1 Content-Type.

A simple test is sufficient to prove the encoding shift.

Assuming an ISO-8859-1 encoding TMX file (see [http://svn.astrumfutura.org/zfblog/branches/…](http://svn.astrumfutura.org/zfblog/branches/ztbug/translate_de.xml) ), the following does a simple strlen() byte count on the output from a single translated umlaut.

 
    <pre class="highlight">require_once 'Zend/Translate.php';
    $translate = new Zend_Translate('tmx', 'translate_de.xml', 'de'); // ISO-8859-1 encoded source
    $translatedUmlaut = $translate->_('umlaut');
    echo strlen($translatedUmlaut); // 2, expected 1 byte only

Notably, no browser here so that part of encoding is irrelevant. Instead a simple internal check shows the output umlaut is a double-byte character when output. Throwing this into a browser with a Content-Type set to the ISO-8859-1 charset results in "Ã ¼" being output.

The rawest solution is to locate the xml\_parser\_call() used in the TMX adapter and pass it the optional output encoding parameter set to "ISO-8859-1" which ensures encoding is untouched, and corrects the above problem. I have not done a similar check against other XML based adapters, but presumably whereever xml\_parser\_create() turns up this possible problem will follow it.
