### Description

Hello,

I'm upgraded the framework to 1.10 version, and after the upgrade, the text, containing diacritic characters disappeard (like áíé...), when I use escape function. I'm using cp-1250 encoding. In previous version, everything works fine (ver. 1.9.4 I have had in past, and downgrade to it again)

Thank You

Szabolcs Csernok

Starting in ZF 1.9.7, Zend\_View now uses utf-8 for the default encoding (previously, Zend-View used ISO-8859-1, or latin-1, as the default). This is in response to security vulnerabilities reported against the framework, and are detailed at:

- [http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/…](http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2010-01)

You can set the view encoding in your application.ini or a bootstrap initializer method if you wish to use an alternate encoding.
