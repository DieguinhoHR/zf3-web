ZF-12124: Zend\_Http\_Client - HTTP Content-charset can not be set
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

As the HTTP-Request-Header provides the charset to be set in the "Content-Type" directive, it is not possible to set it within Zend\_Http\_Client.

For example: "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8" In case of an urlencoded post data request the content-type will be automatically set to "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Any presetted "Content-Type" header directive will be overwritten and it is not possible to change it before the request is done.

Maybe the config array could be enhanced with some "charset" attribute. And the $this::setHeaders(self::CONTENT\_TYPE, XXXX) call in the method "\_prepareBody()" could be improved to use the charset if not null.

Hi - I assume you are directly calling $oHTTPClient->request(Zend\_Http\_Client::POST)

This method does set the form encoding to the default, which includes no charset param. However you can simply call setMethod instead, then set your Content-Type as desired. Finally, call request() with no method specified (you set it above) and the content-type is maintained in the request

$oHTTPClient = new \\Zend\_Http\_Client; // Set URI, post parameters as required, set your request encoding and charset $oHTTPClient->setMethod(\\Zend\_Http\_Client::POST); $oHTTPClient->setHeaders('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'); $oHTTPResponse = $oHTTPClient->request();

 
    [headers:protected] => Array
        (
            [content-type] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Content-Type
                    [1] => application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
                )
    
        )
    
    [method:protected] => POST


HTH, Cheers - Neil
