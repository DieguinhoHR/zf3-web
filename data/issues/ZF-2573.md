ZF-2573: ActionStack option to disable ViewRenderer auto render

### Description

I have found that ActionStack does not act as expected (well, at least as I expected it to act) when forwarding. Using a Controller's \_forward will disable ViewRenderer auto rendering, while using ActionStack to forward will not.

From the manual: "If you perform a \_forward(), redirect, or render manually, autorendering will not occur, as by performing any of these actions you are telling the ViewRenderer that you are determining your own output." ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.actionhelpers.html))

I suggest to have the option (which in my opinion should true by default, since an ActionStack is a forwarding stack), to disable ViewRenderer auto render in ActionStack.

This would only make sense _if_ you use the action helper to add to the stack _from_ a controller; in any other situation, the application will have no context. Here's why.

ActionStack is two separate components, a helper and a plugin. The helper simply provides an easy way to add items to the stack maintained in the plugin, while the plugin does the actual work. The plugin operates during the postDispatch() that occurs during the front controller dispatch loop.

The ViewRenderer renders during the postDispatch of the _action controller_. It has no awareness of the ActionStack at all.

Furthermore, the primary use case of the ActionStack is for building widget-ized or composite layouts. When using ActionStack, you should in most cases render to a separate response segment so that you can later pull out the individual pieces of content to build the final output.

With that in mind, if you are using the ActionStack and _don't_ want such behaviour, you can easily turn off auto-rendering at either the controller level or in your own plugins and action helpers (or subclass the ActionStack to add this behaviour).

I'm not making a decision at this point as to whether or not to honor your request as I want to see if there is additional feedback from other users.

Closing due to lack of feedback. Current behavior is as designed, and alternate methods exist to achieve functionality reporter requests.
