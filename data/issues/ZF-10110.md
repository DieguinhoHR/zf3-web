### Description

Hi

Have a form with a captcha image element.

In view sctipt:

<?php echo $this->form->captcha->renderLabel() ?> // creates one image <?php echo $this->form->captcha->renderCaptcha() ?> // creates another image <?php echo $this->form->captcha->renderCaptcha\_Word() ?> // creates another image With just one form visualization, there are three images in the image folder and the form never validates I think that only renderCaptcha() method should create the image.

Having just <?php echo $this->form ?> in the view script, works as expected with just one image in the folder.

Is this issue related to ZF-8485 ?

Cheers

The render method of Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha calls the generate method of Zend\_Captcha\_Adapter. Therefore when rendering each element of a Captcha in a ViewScript, the Captcha image/word is generated for each element.

In the example above each time the form is rendered 3 seperate Captcha images will be generated.
