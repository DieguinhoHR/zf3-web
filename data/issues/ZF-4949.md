ZF-4949: Incorrect handling of delegation to LiveJournal

### Description

I have delegated my site's (ciaranmcnulty.com) OpenID to my LiveJournal account with the following in the head of the html:

 
    <meta http-equiv="X-XRDS-Location" content="http://ciaranmcnulty.livejournal.com/" />
    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://<a rel="nofollow" href="www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml">www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml</a>" />
    <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://ciaranmcnulty.livejournal.com/" />


I used the example code from the reference guide to create a simple OpenID login page. However, the identity returned by the adapter varies:

1. If I'm already authenticated with LiveJournal my identity is returned (correctly) as <http://ciaranmcnulty.com>
2. If I am logged out of LiveJournal and need to authenticate, my identity is returned as <http://ciaranmcnulty.livejournal.com>

I believe it should be the same in both cases, i.e. delegation should be transparent to users of the adapter.

It may be that this is an error at the LJ end rather than in the component and I'm happy to report it to LJ if that is the case.

As an additional data point, I can log into another OpenID site (stackoverflow.com) with my ciaranmcnulty.com OpenID and it recognises me as ciaranmcnulty.com even if I've had to log in at LiveJournal.

Can you provide some bits of code that can better demonstrate the issue? I am inclined to say that the LJ implementation might be triggering the behavior you are seeing. If this is still an issue for you, please attach a reproduction case and reopen.
