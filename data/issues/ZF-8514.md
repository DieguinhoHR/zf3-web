ZF-8514: I suggest a new isSubmited() method for Zend\_form

### Description

This was inspired by PEAR:Quick\_form submit tracking functionality.

I suggest to add functionality to track which form on the page was actually submited (in case there are more than one). Of cause we can always distinguish by assigning different actions to different forms and actually should do as best-practice. But sometimes (and often) there are situation when after taking action user must be redirected back to page where submit occured (e.g. login form) and it looks beter without redirection, when original page handles the submition.

Another 'pro' is showing form validation errors - using action different form original page leads to situation when it's hard to decide where and how to show errors. Redirecting back to show errors on original page (which is best for user expirience) will not work if form submited to $\_POST.

Now I'm doing that subclassing Zend\_Form like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Default_Form_MyDojoForm extends Zend_Dojo_Form
    {
        private static $_instanceCounter = 0;
    
        protected $trackingField = 'submitTrackingId';
        protected $trackingId = null;
    
        public function __construct($options = null)
        {
            parent:: __construct($options);
    
            self::$_instanceCounter++;
            $this->addElement('hidden', $this->trackingField, array('value' => $this->getTrackingId()));
        }
    
        function isSubmited($data) {
            if ( isset($data[$this->trackingField]) && $data[$this->trackingField] == $this->getTrackingId() ) {
                return true;
            }
    
            return false;
        }
    
        protected function getTrackingId()
        {
            if ($this->trackingId === null) {
                $this->trackingId = sprintf('form_%s_instance_%d', get_class($this), self::$_instanceCounter);
            }
    
            return $this->trackingId;
        }
    }

Isn't this what we have Zend\_Controller\_Request::IsPost() for?

Ok, you know that request was made using post and you having 2+ forms that use post, how will you distinguish which one was submited? And if you'll call isValid($\_POST) on all the forms that was not actually submited they will likely be marked as invalid.

Simple solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->getRequest()->isPost() && $this->getRequest()->has('elementName')) {
        // …
    }

[Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::has()](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/db_Controller_Request_Http.html#%5CZend_Controller_Request_Http::has())

Or:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->getRequest()->isPost() && $this->getRequest()->elementName)) {
        // …
    }


[Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::\_\_isset()](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/db_Controller_Request_Http.html#%5CZend_Controller_Request_Http::__isset())
