### Description

I've searched via the Documentation search and Google yet I can't find any reference in the documentation to this configuration option. It's pretty critical if you want to load a Controller Plugin without init'ing Zend\_Loader.

It'd be nice to have a summary of all Zend\_Application config options in one place, for a quick'n'dirty look up.

Specific options for the default/provided resources should be in their own sections.
