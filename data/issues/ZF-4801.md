### Description

It could be very usefull to provide a way for Zend\_Paginator to cache its data.

When Zend\_Paginator reads actual data, it stores them into a sort of cache : $\_pageItems, but those data does not persist throught HTTP requests as they are just stored in an object property. If Zend\_Paginator could be given a Zend\_Cache\_Core instance, it could use it to store data in a 'real' cache, making seeking throught the pages easier and quicker. Also, this would prevent the final user from inventing such a system.

I think using spl\_object\_hash to generate the cache id is a bad idea : it depends on the internal object handle and handler table pointer. I encounter cache collision when I have multiple paginator objects.
