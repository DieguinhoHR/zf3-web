### Description

Zend\_Form have ability to set certain form elements as "ignored" so no values will be taken from them. However when I call getErrors() or getMessages() methods - I get messages also from ignored form fields while, logically, I should not.

This issue stays unchanged for a year already and still available in latest 1.11.7 version. I've prepared patch for this issue to get it fixed at last. Since there seems to be now way to add attachments to issues - here is link to it: <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7763774/ZF-10056.patch>

Hi Alexander,

Thanks for the patch to contribute to ZF, but I notice that you don't appear to have a CLA on file, if you do, you should get in touch with Ralph Schindler and ask him to assign you the correct groups so that you can attach patches as an attachment rather than inline, otherwise, you should sign the cla ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)) and return it before contributing code, otherwise your contributions may go unused!

The patch does not respect the coding standards!

Alexander,

Nice, I will test your patch tomorrow.

-Alexander, unfortunately I was not able to reproduce this issue. Please check my unit test if I'm missing something.-

Sorry there was an error in my test. Your patch seems to resolve the issue. However, I would truncate the patch to be

Yes, Kim, you right, however I would propose to change patch this way:

because Zend\_Form have 2 methods for validation - isValid() and isValidPartial().

Patch for fixing issue for isValidPartial() too

 

 

Posted by Kim Blomqvist (kblomqvist) on 2011-06-10T14:56:51.000+0000

Alexander, I agree with the latest proposal. I have modified unit test to test also isValidPartial() and packed both the patch and the test in one file.

Are there any situations where it makes sense that a transient field would be ignored (ie: not be included in getValues()) but still need to be validated? My thought process goes along the lines of a CSRF element, which isn't part of the form's data (so would be excluded from getValues()) but still needs to be validated to ensure it's value is correct. If that is a viable use case, then we'll need to rethink the suggested fix.

I've linked this issue with ZF-6909 because in the comments (specifically here: [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6909#comment-39114) and here: [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6909#comment-31612)) there is a discussion about ignore vs disabled and how isValid/isValidPartial don't check the ignore flag. An opinion from Matthew was requested on the matter, but he did not respond.

Adam - this is absolutely a valid argument and definitely the fix needs to be rethought. Fortunately someone has eyes open :)
