ZF-10502: Unable to delete messages from the queue
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-09-29T08:18:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-10-20T06:27:28.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I'm trying to remove a message from a Windows Azure Queue. The message was retrieved using the getMessages method.

When calling deleteMessage on the queue, with the queue name as the first parameter and the message instance as the second parameter, I get the following error:

Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature. RequestId:47ca4b33-49d3-48a6-8dd8-c864fe96b6c7 Time:2010-09-29T15:15:42.0857455Z

Even if I try to delete the messsage right after retrieveing it, I still get the same error.

Important notice: the script works perfectly on the Development Storage and the data I provide is correct since I can put messages in the queue.

Ok, I figured out the problem: the PopReceipt field is not url-encoded. You should apply the urlencode function to the PopReceipt function when calling the deleteMessage method.

I have no way to contribute the patch, but it's trivial to fix. Please remember to fix this in the Windows Azure SDK library from Codeplex too.

Cheers!

Thank you for the comment, I will fix this ASAP.

Strangeness here! I applied the fix and now I get the error message you posted. If I undo the fix, the error is not there... Investigating.

Can you reproduce the issue and print out the values of PopReceipt when the error occurs? I can not reproduce this on my storage account nor dev storage...

I'll look into it myself. It seems to work now, but I can't really explain why. It also looks like those errors are being generated on the production environment from time to time, not always. Must investigate what PopReceipt the failed messages have and will get back with more details.

Thank you for replying so quickly!

Ok, here is what I found:

If there is one element in the queue, deleting it works perfectly (and the PopReceipt generated contains only letters and the = sign).

If I push two elements in the queue and then try to remove the first one (while still being invisible), I get an error that there is an error with the Authorization header. The PopReceipt generated looks like this: AgAAAAEAAAC+GAAAjULfSZtgywE= .

And here is a fragment of the error returned by the REST service:  
 "Server used following string to sign ... popreceipt:AgAAAAEAAAC GAAA/eAwWJtgywE=". Notice that the server returned the urldecoded version of the PopReceipt I sent.

So it looks like it all comes down to PopReceipts and characters inside them. I will also investigate this issue, but a little help is always welcome :)

Did you manage to reproduce this consistently?

 

 

Posted by Lucian Daia (kinetic) on 2010-10-04T10:22:40.000+0000

Well I am not able to reproduce this consistently, but situations like that do pop up from time to time (Under 5%). Try adding hunderds of messages in the queue, one every 10 seconds and, at the other end, read a message every 15 seconds.

Just a thought... Does the error occur if you do not do urlencode() on the popreceipt, but instead a character replace of "+" by " "? (just looking at the details you found)

I might have a clue on what generated the problem. Can't really research now, but will get with details before the weekend.

I managed to get the error two more times, but in like several hundred calls. Here's a dump from my application's log:

2010-10-12T12:47:42+03:00 ALERT (1): Error when deleting queue task with MessageId f2aa33dc-c0fa-4ca9-ae02-de7c9915b3a4 and PopReceipt AgAAAAEAAAApAAAAMR+GIPRpywE=: Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature. RequestId:e646944f-d7ee-4799-a25d-a51765daea71 Time:2010-10-12T09:47:52.9112435Z

It's no big deal for me, since the second attempt to delete this message apparently succeded (otherwise it would still be in the queue).

And here's some other strange thing that probably helped trigger the chain of errors when I reported the bug:

// $nextTask is actually just an instance of a Zend\_Service\_WindowsAzure\_Storage\_QueueMessage $nextTask = $queue->getNextTask(); message = $nextTask->MessageText; // message is an array, obtained by json unserializing the intial message text. Consider the initial message a serialization of something like messageText = array('numeric\_value' => 2013);

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++) { // this will print something like ,0,0,0..... echo sprintf('%d', $message['numeric\_value']); }

HOWEVER, if I just put this line of code:

$numericValue = $message['numeric\_value'];

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++) { // this will print the same value all over again, as it should echo sprintf('%d', $numericValue); }

This oddity seems to appear just for the Windows Azure component.

And to answer your question: I tried replacing "+" by " " when the errors kept appearing and didn't change the situation too much.

As a conclusion: everthing seems to work fine now and I just encountered that error twice in a few thousand queue operations. The code I posted above might be the one that saved me OR maybe it's because I started using another queue.

Going to close this issue then. Seems neither one of us can reproduce this consistently...
