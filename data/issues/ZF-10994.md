### Description

Hi everyone, I just made a Zend application and I'm moving mine app from the dev environment to the life environment. And than the fun is starting. Somehow if I declare in a controller something for the view than something strange is going on.

Example:

//This is ok $this->view->test = 'testing';

You can see at real life: <http://www.ijdar.org/xbrl/>

//This goes wrong $this->view->test = 'testing'; $this->view->anothertest = 'test\_etc etc etc'; $this->view->something = 'something with something';

Then suddenly mine output become:

Object id #50 Object id #51

You can see at real life: <http://www.ijdar.org/xbrl/index/companies>

Instead what I declare in mine controller Some how the object become flushed if I declare to many vars for the view.

Does someone know this issue as well? Because I checked every possible options and mine bootstrap etc is ok, so... Server config: ijdar.org/phpinfo.php. Please let me know because im getting nut:p

Cheers Arjen
