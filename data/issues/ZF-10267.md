### Description

Zend\_Validate\_Hostname should add support for reg-names. See <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2> for detials.

This is basically a name composed of most unreserved characters, incl. underscores, tildas etc. You can also use the same type of host names in /etc/hosts for example. It's way more permissive than DNS.

This detection should be off per default
