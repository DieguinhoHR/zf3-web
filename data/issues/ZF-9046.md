### Description

- zf configure db-adapter
- 'adapter=PDO\_SQLITE&dbname=APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook-dev.db"' Creates the following INI string:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
        resources.db.params.dbname = "APPLICATION_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook.db""


This is not a show stopper, but I think one of three things needs to happen: either (a) parse for constants and/or quotes within value strings and write the result differently; (b) write a note in the documentation about the issue, and what you will need to do to correct it manually; or (c) have an option flag that will allow specifying the string without the constant, but then prepend the constant:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        zf configure db-adapter "adapter=PDO_SQLITE&dbname=/../data/db/guestbook-dev.db" \
        --prepend="dbname=APPLICATION_PATH" -s production


where the prepend option takes key/value pairs of the keys whose values need to be prepended.

This latter is more verbose, but may be easier to implement.
