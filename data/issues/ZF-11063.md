ZF-11063: Zend\_Date year report the previous year
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-02-11T00:34:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-02-11T08:22:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // We create a new date
    $date = new Zend_Date('2011-01-01');
    
    // It is Correct: "01/Gen/2011 00.00.00"
    echo $date->toString();
    
    // It is Wrong: "2010"
    echo $date->toString('YYYY');


This happens with many years (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012), but not with other (2013 etc).

Not an issue of according to the manual and the FAQ "YYYY" is the Calendar (ISO) Year and "yyyy" the real year.
