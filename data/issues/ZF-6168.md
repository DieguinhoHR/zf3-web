### Description

notify() in Console.php used str\_pad() in case ELEMENT\_TEXT, but it doesn't account the length of unicode strings - resulting in wrong lengths and thus moving the line further left into the previous line.

The call to str\_pad() should be switched to Zend\_Text\_MultiByte::strPad()
