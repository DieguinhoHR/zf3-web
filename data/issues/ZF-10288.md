ZF-10288: Zend\_Form and Zend\_Navigation seem to have problems with plural translations

### Description

I have noticed that Zend\_Navigation does not handle plural forms correctly. If you use a plural message id for the label element inside a xml navigation config file the label will not get translated and an empty label is shown.

Zend\_Form also seems to have problems with this. When using a plural form for labels the following warning occurs: PHP Warning: trim() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /usr/share/php/Zend/Form/Decorator/Label.php on line 254

I recently noticed what the real problem could be:

I have a gettext translation with this entry: msgid "CATEGORY" msgid\_plural "CATEGORIES" msgstr[0] "Category" msgstr[1] "Categories"

Now when you use "CATEGORIES" as a label for a form element or a navigation element the translation adapter is called with this string as messageId This messageId cannot be found because for plural translations an array is expected by the translate function but a string is given.

You can use not only the messageId for plural, because Zend\_Translate and Gettext from PHP doesn't support it.

- [Zend\_Translate: Plural notations for Translation](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.plurals.html)
- [PHP: ngettext](http://de3.php.net/manual/de/function.ngettext.php)

_Think out loud:_ The both methods Zend\_Navigation\_Page::setLabel() and Zend\_Form\_Element::setLabel() accept an array like Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::translate()?
