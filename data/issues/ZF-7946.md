### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle::\_connect() throws an exception if the oci8 extension isn't loaded, but the $\_execute\_mode member variable is set to OCI\_COMMIT\_ON\_SUCCESS, which gives an E\_NOTICE without the extension. The following patch may solve the problem, but I don't know the ins and outs of the Adapter logic so I can't be 100% certain that this won't cause other problems.
