ZF-8785: Allow change Zend\_Controller\_Front instance
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2010-01-12T03:53:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-12T06:47:16.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Set singleton instance
     */
    public static function setInstance($instance = null)
    {
       self::$_instance = $instance;
    }


This will allow easier to unit testing and extend front controller or replace to other

Because the constructor and $\_instance property are protected, you can actually extend the front controller already by overriding both of those, plus the getInstance() method (I [blogged](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/135-Extending-Singletons.html) this topic three years ago).

In the meantime, we will not be making further changes to how the front controller singleton works until 2.0, as we'd rather have a comprehensive solution rather than one that is tacked on.

Maybe, You is not understand me (sorry for my bad English) This code allow change instance or hard reset (if set null) Code sample:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class MyFront extends Zend_Controller_Front {
        public function __construct() {}
    }
    Zend_Controller_Front::setInstance(new MyFront());
    
    // use  Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance() in code


I don't have wait for ZF 2.0 . I have use its now in 1.x :(
