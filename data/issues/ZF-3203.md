### Description

With a new instance with disableLoadDefaultDecorators = true, and setDisplayGroupDecorators to just FormElements (or others), I get an exception: ViewHelper decorator cannot render without a registered view object, /Zend/Form/Decorator/ViewHelper.php on line 236

That ViewHelper decorator is called from the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::staticHelper It is instantiated as a new $class() w/o options.

When a viewRenderer helper is instantiated w/o options, no view object is set.

ViewHelper.php line 236 calls $element->getView. The element has no view, which calls the helperBroker. This is where it goes wrong because even if the helperBroker is called and a viewRenderer is instantiated, no view object is set. I made a patch for myself on the ViewRenderer constructor which is: [code] if (null !== $view) { $this->setView($view); } else { $this->setView(new Zend\_View()); } [/code] It works for now but I cannot graps the consequenses of it.

I do not use zend\_controller and no zend\_mvc either. I manually call setView after I instantiate form.
