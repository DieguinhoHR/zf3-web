### Description

This is more of an unexpected problem than a bug I guess, but just to let you guys know, the frontController sets the requests baseUrl if you set it via the controllers setBaseUrl method. You can then grab it via the getBaseUrl accessor, but the problem is the getBaseUrl method does not grab from the request object but from the $\_baseUrl var which is only set if you set the base url using the front controllers setBaseUrl method.

I guess the above might sound confusing so here's some examples:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Assuming that the base url is detected automatically, shouldn't getBaseUrl return the value of the getBaseUrl from the request?
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()
    $front->getBaseUrl() is not the same as $front->getRequest()->getBaseUrl();
    unless $front->setBaseUrl() was set.
