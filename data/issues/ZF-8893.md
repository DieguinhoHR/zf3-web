ZF-8893: Zend\_Feed\_Atom::send and Zend\_Feed\_Rss::send prevent setting of custom headers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-21T11:46:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-13T20:29:44.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The Send method of Zend\_Feed\_Atom and Zend\_Feed\_Rss both prevent the addition of headers other than the content-type header. This prevents the sending of headers in situations such as implementing a REST interface, where you need to send response codes such as 201 for a successful post.

Good solutions could involve either adding additional headers to be sent by the Zend\_Feed object, or accepting a response object which could be preconfigured with the appropriate headers and used to send the http response.

I get all the good ones...:P

Will look into modifying the method. Most likely solution is accepting an array of additional errors - we're down to keeping fixes situational and simple for Zend\_Feed. If possible, I strongly suggest handling headers outside of Zend\_Feed. To get it absolutely perfect would require a lot of work the component should not, to be honest, be concerned about.

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
