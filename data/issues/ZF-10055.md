### Description

The construct of Zend\_Service\_Twitter is changed since 1.10.6. Before, you just gave a username/password and it took care of the rest.

Now you need to give options in an array and/or a Zend\_Oauth\_Consumer object. This is undocumented and unclear what a user has to do to be able to use Zend\_Service\_Twitter.

Apparently, this has something to do with the fact that Twitter doesn't allow HTTP Auth anymore.

Documentation was omitted by a documentation generation error - it's all there in subversion!
