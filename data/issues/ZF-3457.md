### Description

In Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi, the \_translateOption/\_translateValue take far too long to process on large lists.

Calling addElement() drastically improved when I changed nothing in the code but commenting out the if (!$this->\_translateOption($option, $value)) in Zend/Form/Element/Multi.php: public function addMultiOption($option, $value = '')

As a test try making a form and calling: $form->addElement('select', 'timezone', array('label' => 'Timezone', 'value' => $timezone, 'multiOptions' => timezone\_identifiers\_list(), 'description' => 'Pick your timezone.'));

When I benchmarked directly around this call and nothing else using microtime() \_translate made the load time about 8 seconds and with it commented the load time was about .5 seconds.

Have you set a cache for your translations ? Have you tried this several times ?

I expect that your 8 seconds come from loading the translation data in memory from disk.

I have not set a cache (do I need to?), but instead attempted to disable translations with $form->setDisableTranslator(true); (I don't intend to have any translation on the site at all) The 8 seconds was on an old dev computer I was using, my current new computer after several attempts has an average load time (for just the form load - not the whole page) of 2.52 seconds. With the two functions edited to just return\* the average time is 0.38 seconds.

\*The overridden functions are as follows: protected function \_translateOption($option, $value) { if (!isset($this->\_translated[$option])) { $this->options[$option] = $value; $this->\_translated[$option] = true; return true; } return false; }

protected function \_translateValue($value) { return $value; }

A patch has been applied to trunk to bail early from \_translateOption() if the disableTranslator flag is true. Another user has verified that this speeds operations at the same factor as reported with commenting out the call.
