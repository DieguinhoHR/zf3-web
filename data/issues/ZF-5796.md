### Description

The current $\_dateFormat (line 58 of Zend/Service/Twitter.php) value isn't correctly interprated by twitter. It often leads to empty responses when there has to be new tweeds.

I would therefore strongly suggest to use the same format as twitter uses itself in the responses:

Mon Feb 16 13:44:39 +0000 2009

$\_dateFormat = 'D M d H:i:s O Y';

The problem with your format is it's not a valid HTTP-formatted date as the since header is being sent across in the header _If-Modified-Since_

I suggest changing it to: _D, d M Y H:i:s T_ so it's a valid HTTP-formatted date.

This was checked into svn with r14124 and into the release branch with r14125
