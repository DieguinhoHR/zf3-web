ZF-4924: Zend\_Amf\_Server setClass ignores additional arguments passed as argv
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-11-12T05:29:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-21T05:57:03.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.1 (01/Dec/08)

### Description

The method setClass($class, $namespace = '', $argv = null) of Zend\_Amf\_Server ignores the third argument which should be used to pass additional arguments to the later called method.

Current source code Zend/Amf/Server.php line 394: if (3 < func\_num\_args()) {

Since the number of arguments is equal 3 if additional arguments are passed as $argv the test should be modified to: if (2 < func\_num\_args()) {

I was able to recreate this issue. The count is 3 in order to add arguments but it is a base zero count so it needs to be 2. 0-1-2 to check that arguments were passed.

I have checked in this issue to the 1.7.0 trunk to close this bug.
