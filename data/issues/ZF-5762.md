### Description

{panel} 1) testGetWithAnExistingCacheId(Zend\_Cache\_FileBackendTest) Zend\_Cache\_Exception: cache\_dir must be a directory /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framework/branches/release-1.7/library/Zend/Cache.php:208 /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framework/branches/release-1.7/library/Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php:153 /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framework/branches/release-1.7/library/Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php:120 {panel}

The problem is not stable. Two Unit tests passes in the same environment may give different results (with or without this error).

what is your operating system ?

Fedora 8, but if I'm correct I saw the same behavior on Windows (moreover error appears more often there). I could try to track it down.

I can't reproduce this.

Here is the code to get the tmpDir for unit tests :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getTmpDir($date = true)
        {
            $suffix = '';
            if ($date) {
                $suffix = date('mdyHis');
            }
            if (is_writeable($this->_root)) {
                return $this->_root . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'zend_cache_tmp_dir_' . $suffix;
            } else {
                if (getenv('TMPDIR')){
                    return getenv('TMPDIR') . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'zend_cache_tmp_dir_' . $suffix;
                } else {
                    die("no writable tmpdir found");
                }
            }
        }


what is your TMPDIR environnement variable ?

I close this issue due to lack of activity

I still can't reproduce this.

Please reopen if you have more details
