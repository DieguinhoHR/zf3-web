ZF2-436: Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Litteral route crashes with empty string as route
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

For example, the following code:

 
    $request = new \Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Request;
    $route = new \Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\Literal('');
    $route->match($request, strlen($request->getBaseUrl()));


Will raise the following error:

 
    Fatal error: Uncaught PHP error with message: 'strpos(): Empty delimiter' in ... /Zend/Mvc/Router/Http/Literal.php:99


It is possible to workaround this problem with an empty Regex route.
