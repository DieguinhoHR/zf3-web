### Description

First of all sorry for bad English. As i already wrote Rename filter does not deletes temporary files when the file already existsts

public function receive($files = null) { ... if (!$this->\_filter($file)) { [ i think unlink function should be used here ] return false; } ... }

The rename filter has no receive method. And the rename filter does not act on temporary files.

Temporary files are completly created by PHP using a unique filename. ZF has no access to the created name of the temporary files.

Closing issue due to non-response
