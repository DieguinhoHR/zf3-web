### Description

Hi All,

Ticket #10000 on the bug tracker has added a functionality and was committed on release r22850.

It changes Zend\_Db\_Select::having() method and Zend\_Db\_Select::orHaving() method in Zend\_Db\_Select to allow us to pass the optional second parameter which way the $value should be quoted.

The patch was :

- if (func\_num\_args()> 1) {
- $val = func\_get\_arg(1);
- $cond = $this->\_adapter->quoteInto($cond, $val);
- if ($value) {
- $cond = $this->\_adapter->quoteInto($cond, $value, $type); }

My problem is that i can't pass a value which is considered as false (0, an empty string) in the statement. So i can't do :

 
    $select->having("foo = ?", 0); 


or

 
    $select->orHaving("foo = ?", 0);
