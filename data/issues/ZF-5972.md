### Description

if (!$index = array\_search($key, $this->\_files[$file]['validators'])){ ==> if ($index ===0) the test is skipped and the validator is not removed

=> better use : if ( ($index = array\_search($key, $this->\_files[$file]['validators'])) === false ) {

That's correct behaviour.

It is not allowed to delete the Upload validator as it's essential for file uploads. And the upload validator is always attached as first validator for file elements.
