Reassigning to Ralph to bring closure to this issue.

Another release, another e-mail about this ticket. This is a two-second fix and it's been pushed back for 10 versions now. If it's not going to be fixed, please mark it as "won't fix" and close it, but I'm tired of being e-mailed every time it is pushed back. :-)

I'm tired of hearing about this.

Can someone explain the problem to me? It seems like a real easy fix to me...

I'm looking in the code of Zend\_Db\_Statement right now, and it was apparently fixed some time ago.

Re-opening to close with a proper "resolved" status as it appears it is already fixed in trunk.

This is and has been fixed in trunk for some time now; marking it as resolved: fixed.
