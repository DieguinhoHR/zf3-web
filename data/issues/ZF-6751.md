### Description

Trying to implement Zend\_Amf on IBM i5/OS ZC for i5 php5.2.6 Apache 2.0.x GOLD CUSTOMER Timpanogos Tech ZENDID= paulbl this also entered into Zend Troubleticket system and closed 180313 becuase support transfered to this Issue tracker in ZF site.

ZEND INTERFACE=Mike Pavalak is working with customer and needs R n D support to discover if AMF should be working on i5/OS or is it a bug in ZF1.8.1? STAS said he would look into this

THE PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Server.php giving following msg: CommandMessage::12 not implemented

This comes from the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /*
    * Handles each of the 11 different command message types.
    *
    * A command message is a flex.messaging.messages.CommandMessage
    *
    * @see Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_CommandMessage
    * @param Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_CommandMessage $message
    * @return Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_AcknowledgeMessage
    */
    protected function _loadCommandMessage(Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_CommandMessage $message)
    {
    switch($message->operation) {
    case Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_CommandMessage::CLIENT_PING_OPERATION :
    require_once 'Zend/Amf/Value/Messaging/AcknowledgeMessage.php';
    $return = new Zend_Amf_Value_Messaging_AcknowledgeMessage($message);
    break;
    default :
    require_once 'Zend/Amf/Server/Exception.php';
    throw new Zend_Amf_Server_Exception('CommandMessage::' . $message->operation . ' not implemented');
    break;
    }
    return $return;

What the Flex is doing to cause this?

Any new information on this? Command 12 is a channel disconnect operation, which is not supported currently. I would like to know a scenario where it appeared.
