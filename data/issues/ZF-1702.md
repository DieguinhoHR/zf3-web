Related to ZF-1835; ViewRenderer inflection is the root of these issues.

Won't fix. This is the intended behaviour, and is in place to assure that changes in case do not affect locating view scripts in the filesystem (which may or may not be case sensitive).

With the 1.5 release, you will be able to modify the inflection rules used to normalize the name when resolving a view script, which will allow individual developers to solve this issue to suit their particular file system layout needs.
