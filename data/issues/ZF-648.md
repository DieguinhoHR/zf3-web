### Description

After Zend\_Http\_Client supports proxy servers, refactor Zend\_Service\_Abstract and Zend\_Rest\_Client to use that feature. The objective is to allow the user to specify options that are passed to Zend\_Http\_Client, and that component will utilize the right adapter to support connections via a proxy server.

This can be done very easily for all Zend\_Service\_Abstract-based components:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $httpClient = new Zend_Http_Client(null, array( 
        'adapter'    => 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Proxy', 
        'proxy_host' => 'proxy.example.com', 
        'proxy_port' => 8080, 
        'proxy_user' => 'me', 
        'proxy_pass' => 'bananarama' 
    )); 
     
    // Pass it into the akismet client 
    Zend_Service_Akismet::setHttpClient($httpClient);


The service classes themselves do not need to implement the behaviour.

Functionality has existed all along; simply pass in an HTTP client that utilizes the proxy adapter.
