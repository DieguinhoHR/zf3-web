ZF-1812: Fail gracefully if image jpeg support is not present.

### Description

The Zend\_Pdf component correctly throws an exception if JPEG support is not enabled in the image extension.

However, the demo script, /demos/Zend/Pdf/demo.php, should catch this exception at the appropriate place and fail with a gentle error message instead of a fatal error if the exception is thrown.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
