### Description

I am trying to load backend options from ini file and as a result all parameters are passed as a string/ Passing permission umask as a string to mkdir or chmod results unexpected permissions to be set.

Casting umask options with octdec function should fix the problem.

This is not a Zend\_Cache issue (permissions umask doesn't have to be a string)

But, I understand your problem and I can probably introduce something to deal with it.

So I changed the issue type to "improvement" instead of "bug"

probably just fixed in SVN trunk

Can you try it ?
