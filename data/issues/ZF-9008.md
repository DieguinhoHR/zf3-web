### Description

The new "button" jQuery UI element allows to make fancy Checkboxes, Radio and Buttons in Forms.

There should be a simple form-decorator that renders radio, buttons and such with "button" or "buttonset".

I don't bother about adding new view helpers for those elements, they can easily be progressivly enhanced by calling:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->jQuery()->addOnLoad('$(".myRadio").button()');


Maybe it would be a good idea though to add a view helper with something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->jQueryButton('.mySubmit');
    $this->jQueryButtonSet('.myRadio', array('text' => false, 'primary' => 'icon-myradio'));


Which could be used inside the Form Decorator also.
