### Description

On the website, some characters are appearing as "???". I've seen this in a few places, and mostly seems to occur with lists. One example URL is:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.basic)

This causes problems in both Firefox/Windows XP and Safari/Windows XP. (See attachments.) I don't think this is an encoding problem--it seems as though the "???" really are embedded in the file.
