### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // assuming $form is Zend_Dojo_Form object
    $form->addElement(
        'DateTextBox',
        'foo',
        array(
            'label'          => 'Datum:',
            'required'       => true,
            'formatLength'   => 'long',
        )
    );


"formatLength" is handled as constraint for the added Dijit. The constraint is added to the params at "var zendDijits". Unfortunately the constraint's key is removed before. This is caused by the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit::\_prepareDijit()-function:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _prepareDijit(array $attribs, array $params, $type, $dijit = null)
        {
            [...]
    
            // Normalize constraints, if present
            foreach ($this->_jsonParams as $param) {
                if (array_key_exists($param, $params)) {
                    require_once 'Zend/Json.php';
    
                    if (is_array($params[$param])) {
                        $values = array();
                        foreach ($params[$param] as $key => $value) {
                            if (!is_string($value)) {
                                continue;
                            }
                            $values[] = $value;  // the value is added without its key,
                                                 // please change it to: $values[$key] = $value;
                        }
                    } [...]
    
                    $params[$param] = $values;
                }
            }
            
            [...]
        }


(please see code comments)

I added a patch file for svn to solve this issue. I don't know if this affects other behaviors. It works for me and seems to cause no problems as far as I understand the code.

I'm working with the svn trunk version.
