### Description

In the function limit() in the class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql there is a problem with the usage of an uninitialized variable in line 137. The line looks like this:

$order = implode(',', $parts['order']);

The variable $parts has not been initialized in the context of the function limit() nor was it passed to the function as a parameter.

Duplicate and also appears to have become obsolete with Justin's re-implementation of the limit() method from [changeset 969](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mssql.php?r1=841&r2=969)

Yes, confirmed that this fix was done a long time ago, and was released in Zend Framework 0.2.0.
