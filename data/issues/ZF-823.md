ZF-823: isTomorrow() and isYesterday() do not work as expected
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-29T19:24:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:42.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.8.0 (21/Feb/07)

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function isTomorrow()
        {
            $today = $this->date('Ymd');
            $day   = $this->date('Ymd',$this->getUnixTimestamp());
            return (($today - $day) == -1);
        }


If $today is 20051231 and $day is 20060101, then 20051231 - 20060101 = -8870

Also, we need to take into account Daylight Savings Time, leap years, and leap seconds.
