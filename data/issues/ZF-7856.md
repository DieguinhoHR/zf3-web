ZF-7856: Problem with Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document\_Html

### Description

This issue concerns indexing .html files. My code looks like this:

$doc = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document\_Html::loadHTMLFile($doc\_filenameandpath, true); $index->addDocument($doc);

and generates this error:

Fatal error: Call to a member function removeChild() on a non-object in D:\\wamp\\www\\ZendFramework-1.9.1\\library\\Zend\\Search\\Lucene\\Document\\Html.php on line 106

So, I go to line 106 of that file and comment out the following line:

// $head->parentNode->removeChild($head);

and all works fine. But obviously, this can't be the correct fix.

For reference, this is the .html file I have been testing with.

Thanks. I've installed the patched file and all works perfectly now. :-)
