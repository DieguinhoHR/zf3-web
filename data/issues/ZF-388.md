### Description

Reduce the complexity of instantiation from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Config.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Config/Ini.php';
    $config = new Zend_Config(Zend_Config_Ini::load('/path/to/config.ini', 'staging'));


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Config/Ini.php';
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini('/path/to/config.ini', 'staging');

Your proposed syntax would probably require deriving Zend\_Config\_Ini from Zend\_Config to get all the common iteration, counting, \_\_get etc code. During the original proposal process, it was decided that this was not desirable.

I would have thought that a syntax more like Zend\_Db would be preferred for consistency?

i.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = Zend_Config::factory('ini', array('filename'=>'/path/to/config.ini', 
                     'section'=>'staging'));


would be more in line with Zend\_Db's system.

Indeed, I left the approach you mention above to be considered as a separate issue, since the two approaches need not be mutually exclusive.

The factory approach remains [here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/hQw) for reference purposes; we may end up creating a JIRA issue for this, too.

I'll have some patches ready soon to help resolve this one; I want to coordinate with you on the development and nail down issues with respect to the next release. :)
