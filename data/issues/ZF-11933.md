### Description

Consider the following config file:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    [section]
    foo.params[in.brackets] = a
    foo.params.bare = b
    foo.params[] = c
    foo.params[] = d


And the following code:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini('test-with-section.ini', 'section');
    print_r($config->toArray());


The result is as expected:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Array
    (
        [foo] => Array
            (
                [params] => Array
                    (
                        [in.brackets] => a
                        [0] => c
                        [1] => d
                        [bare] => b
                    )
    
            )
    
    )


If I take the [section] part out of the config file and I call Zend\_Config\_Ini's constructor without the second argument, I would expect the result to be the same. It is in fact quite different:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Array
    (
        [foo.params] => Array
            (
                [in] => Array
                    (
                        [brackets] => a
                    )
    
                [0] => c
                [1] => d
            )
    
        [foo] => Array
            (
                [params] => Array
                    (
                        [bare] => b
                    )
    
            )
    
    )


It seems that brackets in the key are not parsed correctly when the section is not present.

The workaround is to add a dummy section to your config. Since an easy workaround exists, I set the Priority to Minor when filing this bug.
