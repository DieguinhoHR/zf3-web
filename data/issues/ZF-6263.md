ZF-6263: Bug in Zend\_Mail subject in case of special charachters (ZF-2559 not fixed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The following strings:

"Bekræftigelse af reservation med Goopoint Online Appointments den 16-04-2009 kl. 09:00." and "Bekræftigelse af reservation med Fullxml.dk den 24-04-2009 kl. 09:00."

Are set as the subject by Zend\_Mail::setSubject();

When the e-mail is sent, they come out with unwanted extra spaces (after 09: and Fullxml.):

"Bekræftigelse af reservation med Goopoint Online Appointments den 16-04-2009 kl. 09: 00." and "Bekræftigelse af reservation med Fullxml. dk den 24-04-2009 kl. 09:00."

If the special character 'æ' is changed in 'a' then the spaces are gone. Hope this can be fixed.

This issue needs more informations.

For example, encoding of your string. it is ISO-8859-1 ? I do not know what language you use. use or not setHeaderEncoding() .

Dear Satoru Yoshida,

Here the answers to your questions:

The encoding is standard (ISO-8859-1) The language is Danish (but why is that important, it is about the character string I think) setHeaderEncoding isn't used, see the php code below:

This is the code when the problem occurs:

 <?php require\_once('Zend/Mail.php'); $mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $mail->setSubject('Bekræftigelse af reservation med Goopoint Online Appointments den 16-04-2009 kl. 09:00.'); $mail->setBodyText('Test'); $mail->addTo('info@spintop.nl'); $mail->send(); ?>

Committed Fix to trunk.

Changed Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintableHeader() again to only break at spaces. This is the only possible way to ensure in every setup that headers are displayed correctly in many different mail-clients when they are broken into several lines.

If problems occur with too long headers, because no spaces occur please use Base64 Encoding, which does not suffer from this problems.
