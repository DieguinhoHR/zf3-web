### Description

On [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table) there's a typo in the first "code sample" box for application/configs/application.ini:

Three times it says resource._sdb_.params.dbname. It should be resources.db.params.dbname (as in the "code sample" box that follows).
