Could you give more information? What's the exception? What's your query? Could you try and reproduce this with the latest version from SVN?

exception launched Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception,  
 i am with the latest version,

problem query generated by getCountSelect

query passed object select

SELECT d.id,number\_document ,type\_document ,date\_publication ,link FROM "key\_word" AS "kw" INNER JOIN "word\_document" AS "wd" ON kw.id = wd.key\_word\_id INNER JOIN "document" AS "d" ON d.id = wd.document\_id INNER JOIN "type\_document" AS "td" ON td.id = d.type\_document\_id WHERE (wd.id IN( 48, 21, 56, 47 )) GROUP BY "d"."id", "number\_document", "type\_document", "date\_publication", "link") AS "wd"

query generated

SELECT COUNT(1) AS "zend\_paginator\_row\_count" FROM (SELECT d.id,number\_document ,type\_document ,date\_publication ,link FROM "key\_word" AS "kw" INNER JOIN "word\_document" AS "wd" ON kw.id = wd.key\_word\_id INNER JOIN "document" AS "d" ON d.id = wd.document\_id INNER JOIN "type\_document" AS "td" ON td.id = d.type\_document\_id WHERE (wd.id IN( 48, 21, 56, 47 )) GROUP BY "d"."id", "number\_document", "type\_document", "date\_publication", "link") AS "wd" WHERE (wd.id IN( 48, 21, 56, 47 ))

What is the exception message? What is the stack trace? Did you try and reproduce this with the latest version from SVN?

Message SQLSTATE[42703]: Undefined column: 7 ERROR: column wd.id does not exist LINE 9:"link") AS "wd" WHERE (wd.id IN( 48, 21, 56, 47 ))

tested with the latest version from SVN, version used 1.8.4

problem code generated SELECT COUNT(1) AS "zend\_paginator\_row\_count" FROM ( SELECT id FROM test AS t WHERE test\_id = 10 ) AS t WHERE test\_id = 10

Note the last condition is duplicated, is necessary reset object select where.

the correct in my opine would

SELECT COUNT(1) AS "zend\_paginator\_row\_count" FROM ( SELECT id FROM test AS t WHERE test\_id = 10 ) AS t

sorry please, problem version used, with this if

if (($isDistinct && count($columnParts) > 1) || count($groupParts) > 1 || !empty($havingParts)) { $rowCount->reset(Zend\_Db\_Select::FROM);

 
                $rowCount->from($this->_select);


}

in version of the svn, creates a new object Zend\_Db\_Select

if (($isDistinct && count($columnParts) > 1) || count($groupParts) > 1 || !empty($havingParts)) { $rowCount = $db->select()->from($this->\_select); }
