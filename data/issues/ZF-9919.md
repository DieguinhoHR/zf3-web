### Description

Hi

I'm reporting a bug in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_ServerUrl constructor. During my works I found that I was on a SSL-encrypted page but found links which weren't using the https scheme. After clicking on these I wasn't on a secure page anymore (security risk, therefore critical).

These templates were calling serverUrl() which is a method of the Zend\_View\_Helper\_ServerUrl class. So I found out that its constructor isn't setting the scheme properly because it doesn't parse $\_SERVER properly. Currently it parses only $\_SERVER['HTTPS'] to find out if the current page is SSL encrypted or not.

Ideally we also should parse $\_SERVER['HTTP\_SCHEME'] and $\_SERVER['SERVER\_PORT'], here a temporary solution which works for me:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
        public function __construct()
        {
            if ((isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) &&
                        (strcasecmp($_SERVER['HTTPS'], 'on') === 0 ||
                            $_SERVER['HTTPS'] === true)) ||
    
                (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_SCHEME']) &&
                    (strcasecmp($_SERVER['HTTP_SCHEME'], 'https') === 0)) ||
    
                (isset($_SERVER['SERVER_PORT']) &&
                    $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] == 443)) {
    
                $scheme = 'https';
    
            } else {
                $scheme = 'http';
            }


$\_SERVER['HTTP\_SCHEME'] is used when pages have been redirected by nginx, so we can't ignore that. Many thanks for your attention and bugfixing it.

Probably this isn't a bug. But can you give at least subclasses a chance to tell the constructor in which indexes of $\_SERVER it should parse for any indications that the current request is a SSL one?

Probably a protected method returning an array, by default array('HTTPS') which could be overwritten in my subclass with array('HTTPS', 'HTTP\_SCHEME')

Thanks!
