### Description

The documentation states that action helpers are accessed using $this->\_helpers property of the controller, while they are actually accessed using $this->\_helper property, eg.:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // INCORRECT
    $flashMessenger = $this->_helpers->getHelper('FlashMessenger');
    // CORRECT
    $flashMessenger = $this->_helper->getHelper('FlashMessenger');


Please check 7.8 Action Helpers chapter.
