### Description

I made two functions inside Zend\_Ldap->search.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function search($filter, $basedn = null, $scope = self::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB,
            array $attributes = array(), $sort = null, $sortDir = null, $resultChangeCase = null, $collectionClass = null)


sortDir would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strtolower($sortDir) == 'desc') {
        array_reverse($result, true);
    }


resultChangeCase would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $result = Zend_Ldap->search(...);
    
    if ($resultChangeCase != null) {
        if (!in_array($resultChangeCase, array('strtolower' ,'strtoupper', 'ucfirst', 'ucwords'))) {
            throw new Exception('...');
        }
        array_walk_recursive($result, function(&$value, $key, $func) {
            $value = $func($value);
        }, $resultChangeCase);
    }


I hope you guys enjoy it! :)

Forgot to describe $result.

Changing the sort direction is a PHP-one-liner - I doubt it'll make sense to add another parameter to the already very long method signature of Zend\_Ldap::search(). This functionality can easily be provided by user-land code.

Generall I like the idea of modifying the LDAP options properties' names but it won't be sufficient to provide this functionality in Zend\_Ldap::search() - there are a lot more methods where a change would be necessary. I doubt that the work will be worth the effort as you won't gain anything new (LDAP attributes are case-insensitiv per se).

As you said, it's a trivial case.

Still on the subject, i'd suggest that options should be in array. The reason is simple: if I need just some attributes, I'll need to fill every parameter till I get on attributes's parameter.

Considering that I'm not using any filters, default baseDn, default scope, I'll have to fill in three parameters till I get where I want.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function search($filter, $basedn = null, $scope = self::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB,
            array $attributes = array(), $sort = null, $sortDir = null, $resultChangeCase = null, $collectionClass = null)


And options being an array, you could consider my suggestions above. :)

The new way would look like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function search(array(
        'attributes' => array('displayname', 'cn', 'dn', 'departament', 'description')
    ))


Much easier :)

Issue is reopened, but:

- the option to change the attributes' names will not be added as the component favors lowercase attribute names in general
- the option to reverse the sort direction cannot be added to Zend\_Ldap::search() because the component relies solely on the LDAP server's capability to sort a result set. Results are retrieved sequentially from the server instead of instantiating the complete result set all at once. The option will be added to Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries() as the whole result set is available here.

Both to Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries() and Zend\_Ldap::search() will be changed to accept an array parameter to remove the need to work through all the methods' parameters.

fixed in trunk (r18883): added $reverseSort argument to Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries() added possibility to pass parameters to Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries() and Zend\_Ldap::search() in a single array argument

Couldn't you add the 'resultChangeCase' function on Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries() ?

Treating results' case in the source (Zend\_Ldap::searchEntries()) would be better than treat one by one later. Considering that most of AD servers' entries aren't standardized, I think that it's better all come in one single case format (lower or upper for me) and then work upon results.

What do you think about it ? :)

Attribute names are already normalized to lower-case. I think there is no need to add this option just for the sake of cosmetics.
