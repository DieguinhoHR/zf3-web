### Description

The first argument for the constructor is 'label', which is rarely used by the current use cases of the gd:where element. Calendar, the current major service using this element, only generally uses the 'valueString' attribute.

Before the Calendar extension is heavily used, and before ZF 1.0 is released, I recommend re-ordering the constructor arguments to have valueString as the first argument.
