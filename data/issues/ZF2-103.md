Any news on it?

Zend\\Tool does not work with ZF2. You can clone the [ZendSkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication) to get a base working ZF2 project.

I'm closing this, as I'll be removing Zend\\Tool prior to the upcoming beta3 release. The functionality is largely replaced by having the ZendSkeletonApplication repository, and we will be creating functionality for tooling surrounding our Zend\\Console component for beta4.

removing Zend\\Tool entirely? not only Zend\\Tool\\Project, Zend\\Tool\\Framework too ?

Yes. We'll likely build such functionality off a combination of Zend\\Console and Zend\\Code\\Generator in the future; the current solution had design goals that we don't feel fit ZF2, and which are hard to maintain and extend.
