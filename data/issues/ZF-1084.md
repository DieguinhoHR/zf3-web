### Description

After updating my copy of ZF to 0.9, Zend\_Db\_Table does not seem to work anymore unless explicitly specifying $\_name in the model.

Revision 4129 restores an implied table-name, based on the class name.

No inflection is used. The class name and the table name must be identical, or else you must specify the table name in the $\_name protected variable.

Marking this issue as fixed. The fix is in revision 4129.
