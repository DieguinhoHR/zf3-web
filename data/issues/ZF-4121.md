ZF-4121: Zend\_View\_Stream is registered in Zend\_View regardless of preference
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_View\_Stream is not used by default in Zend\_View; however, if PHP's "short\_open\_tag" is disabled, Zend\_View\_Stream is required and registered as a stream (regardless if it's going to be used or not).

Your fix will not work. It will break registering the stream when short tags are enabled. I will work on a better patch and submit it when i get it done and tested.

This will not work because you need short tags enabled to use the stream feature. If you look at the \_run() method you have to have short tags enabled and pass in useStreamWrapper in your config to actually enabled it and run it.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _run()
        {
            if ($this->_useViewStream && $this->useStreamWrapper()) {
                include 'zend.view://' . func_get_arg(0);
            } else {
                include func_get_arg(0);
            }
        }

A quick look using a basic app skeleton, XDebug, and KCacheGrind clearly shows that registering a stream has no perceptible measurable performance impact. If a future demonstration of a performance problem arises, then the issue may be revisited.
