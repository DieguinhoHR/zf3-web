### Description

In my opinion it is usefull to have a 2D / 3D validator like:

2 dimensional validator: + setable with validator default Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan 0 + setable hight validator default Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan 0

3 dimensional validator extends 2 dimensional validator: + setable depth validator default Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan 0

n dimensional validator extends 3 dimensional validator: + setable validator default Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan 0 - 1 = width - 2 = height - 3 = depht

Usage for example it is vary simple to create an dimensional image validator.

Please add a possible usecase for this validator. It's not right clear what this validator should validate.

Also it's not clear what datastructure should be validated ? Numbers, Arrays, Strings, Objects, Others ?

Closing as "wont fix" as there is no response and too less informations on what the problem is
