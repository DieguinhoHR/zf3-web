### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_App, line 728

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function import($uri, $client = null,
            $className='Zend_Gdata_App_Feed')
        {
            $app = new Zend_Gdata_App($client);
            $requestData = $app->prepareRequest('GET', $uri);
            $response = $app->performHttpRequest(
                $requestData['method'], $requestData['url']);
    
            $feedContent = $response->getBody();
            if (!$this->_useObjectMapping) {
                return $feedContent;
            }
            $feed = self::importString($feedContent, $className);
            if ($client != null) {
                $feed->setHttpClient($client);
            }
            return $feed;
        }


This static function has $this inside.

Actually it's my IDE which highlighted the file as containing errors and I don't know when exactly this function is called and if it's really needed, but it just looks so wrong.

Perhaps it works with 5.2 php version, with > 5.3 such a function will cause fatal error.

By the way, please someone unittest this...
