### Description

There's still a problem with the Zend Application/Router/Zend Navigation Resource. I wish you wouldn't mark as resolved unless the issue has been thurouhgly resolved. Why would the below be breaking the router setup?

This is my setup

 
    public function routeShutdown(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
    {   
        $module = $request->getModuleName();
    
        switch ($module) {
            case 'default':
                $includeFile = include APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/navigation.default.php';
                break;
            case 'admin':
                $includeFile = include APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/navigation.admin.php';
                break;
            default:
                throw new Exception('App_Plugin_Bootstrap_Navigation - Module not found.');
        }
    
        $pages = new Zend_Navigation($includeFile);
    
        $bootstrap = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap');
    
        $view = $bootstrap->getResource('view');
    
        $view->navigation($pages);
    
    }


This is my default navigation array.

return array( array( 'label' => 'Welcome', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index' ), array( 'label' => 'Archives', 'title' => 'View Weblog Archives', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'archives' ), array( 'label' => 'Authors', 'title' => 'Authors Control Panel', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'author', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'author' ), array( 'label' => 'Login', 'title' => 'Click Here To Login', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'login', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'login' ), array( 'label' => 'Logout', 'title' => 'Click Here To Logout', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'logout', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'logout' ), array( 'label' => 'Profiles', 'title' => 'View Author Profiles', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'profiles', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'profiles' ), array( 'label' => 'Setup', 'title' => 'View Your Setup', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'setup', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'setup' ), array( 'label' => 'Administration', 'title' => 'System Administration', 'module' => 'admin', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'admin' ), array( 'label' => 'Register', 'title' => 'Click Here To Register', 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'register', 'action' => 'index', 'resource' => 'login' ), );

I'm using the array config Zend Application setup. My array router resource setup is below. Here are the problems the first route "entry" is a correctly designed route. But when I try to access it Zend Controller Router Exception throws an exception that the title is not defined. This is a simple route that should not require any extra parameters. Second If I add a single static route as in the default-flash route. Zend Navigation completely breaks and none of the links work. There's obviously serious issues concerning how Zend Navigation/Router/Application are working together here. _Note_ I have gotten this to work and that is by defining every single route the system has + defining in Zend Navigation a route for every single page link has which becomes utterly redundant and un manageable. Side note I'm using the exact setup as described in the manual a simple virtual host index.php/.htacces are in the public folder nothing special there. A Zend\_Tool created project. I don't think that has anything to do with it. Apache/Vista.

Three hours later. I just recreated my entire setup using config ini. I've narrowed down that Zend Navigation is causing the issue.

<?php return array( 'entry' => array( 'type' => 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route', 'route' => 'entry/:title', 'defaults' => array( 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index' ) ), 'tags' => array( 'type' => 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route', 'route' => 'tag/:tag', 'defaults' => array( 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'tag', 'tag' => '\\d+' ) ), 'admin-users-edit' => array( 'type' => 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route', 'route' => 'admin/users/edit/:id', 'defaults' => array( 'module' => 'admin', 'controller' => 'users', 'action' => 'edit', 'id' => '\\d+' ) ), 'default-flash' => array( 'type' => 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static', 'route' => 'flash', 'defaults' => array( 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'flash', 'action' => 'index' ) ), );

This is my Zend Application array/config.

<?php return array\_merge\_recursive(array( 'includePaths' => array( 'library' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/library' ), 'bootstrap' => array( 'path' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/bootstrap.php', 'class' => 'Bootstrap' ), 'autoloaderNamespaces' => array( 'App\_' ), 'resources' => array( 'App\_Bootstrap\_Resource\_Database' => array( 'App\_Bootstrap\_Resource\_Database' ), 'frontController' => array( 'moduleDirectory' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules', 'plugins' => array( 'acl' => 'App\_Plugin\_Auth\_Acl', 'db' => 'App\_Plugin\_Db\_Profiler', 'dispatch' => 'App\_Plugin\_Dispatch\_IsRoute', 'error' => 'App\_Plugin\_Error\_Handler', 'layout' => 'App\_Plugin\_Layout\_Module', 'nav' => 'App\_Plugin\_Bootstrap\_Navigation', 'view' => 'App\_Plugin\_Bootstrap\_View', 'cloud' => 'App\_Plugin\_Cloud\_Tag' ), 'actionhelperpaths' => array( 'Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules/default/helpers' ) ), 'translate' => array( 'registry\_key' => 'lang', 'adapter' => 'array', 'data' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/configs/language', 'default' => 'en', 'translations' => array( 'en' => 'english', 'es' => 'spanish' ), 'options' => array( 'scan' => 'directory' ) ), 'locale' => array( 'default' => 'en\_EN' ), 'router' => array( 'routes' => include dirname(**FILE**) . '/routes.config.php' ), 'view' => array( 'helperPath' => array( 'App\_View\_Helper\_' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules/default/views/helpers/' ) ), 'layout' => array( 'layout' => 'default', 'layoutPath' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules/default/layouts/scripts' ), 'db' => array( 'adapter' => 'pdo\_mysql', 'isDefaultTableAdapter' => true, 'params' => array( //'charset' => 'utf-8', 'profiler' => array( 'class' => 'Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug', 'enabled' => true ) ) ) ) ), include dirname(**FILE**) . '/' . APPLICATION\_ENV . '.config.php');

Below is an exception related to the title not being specified.

Could you please attach some actual code, and the exact errors?

"Note I have gotten this to work and that is by defining every single route the system has + defining in Zend Navigation a route for every single page link has which becomes utterly redundant and un manageable."

That is the idea for now, therefore, not an issue.

 

 

Posted by Tom Shaw (tomshaw) on 2009-05-19T20:20:04.000+0000

Dolf. I've already made an issue of this in zf-general and Mathew specificaly said you _do not_ have to define every route.

 

 

Posted by Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme) (freak) on 2009-05-20T04:49:56.000+0000

As said, I of course can be wrong (I'm human too, jfyi ;)), so feel free to reopen this issue.

Firstly, your code is very badly formatted and hard to read, it would have been helpful of you to made it clearer.

Your entry route appears to have no default set for the parameter 'title', which means that requesting the url '/entry/' will result in the exception described being thrown, as expected.

From the code you have pasted, you have told none of your page resources seem to use the 'entries' route either, so how are your url's being generated?

and lastly, in this issue, nowhere does it clearly state what the ACTUAL issues is. could you be clearer about exactly what behaviour should be expected, and what is observed?

Also, it looks like you have been editing the issue, You should be posting further comments, instead of editing the issue description. Doing so makes it very hard to follow what has been said, how things have progressed, and how things currently stand.

This is how I create the error as straightforward as possible. First create a new zend tool project. zf create project. Edit the ini file and add the lines

resources.router.routes.news.type = "Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static" resources.router.routes.news.route = "news" resources.router.routes.news.defaults.module = "default" resources.router.routes.news.defaults.controller = "index" resources.router.routes.news.defaults.action = "gohere"

resources.router.routes.entry.type = "Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route" resources.router.routes.entry.route = "entry/:title" resources.router.routes.entry.defaults.module = "default" resources.router.routes.entry.defaults.controller = "index" resources.router.routes.entry.defaults.action = "index"

Test these routes they work perfectly like they should. Now add your Zend\_Navigation data either array or ini which ever is easier. Test your routes again. In my case, after following the exact steps they do not work any longer.

I forgot to mention don't forget to call you navigation menu in your layout. <?= $this->navigation()->menu()->renderMenu(null,array('maxDepth' => 0, 'ulClass' => 'level1nav')); ?>

 

 

Posted by Tom Shaw (tomshaw) on 2009-05-20T08:28:26.000+0000

I've include a Zend Tool project demonstrating what happens. Take out the navigation code inside the layout and test to see if the routes are working. Replace the zend navigation code back into the layout and the routes stop working.

I just lost a lot of hair over the very same problem. I think it should be reopened. Or is there a fix that I have overlooked?

 

 

Posted by Joe Conigliaro (joe-w3design) on 2009-06-26T09:01:58.000+0000

There is definitely an issue here,

 

 

Posted by Sebastian Hoitz (nekromanter) on 2009-08-12T08:14:12.000+0000

I also think this is an issue. I spent several hours working out why I got this error.

Plus I don't want to specify the default route for _every_ navigation entry I create.

For more information on my issue, see this Stackoverflow question:

Posted by Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme) (freak) on 2009-08-12T08:20:01.000+0000

Changing component to zend\_navigation as this is definitely not a zend\_app issue (as mentioned previously).

& reopening as requested.

Disclaimer: I did not read the issue thoroughly, because it's long, not properly formatted, and it does not summarize what the actual issue is.

That being said... This looks like the well-known issue with the URL helper and routing subsystem. If the 'route' param is omitted when using the URL helper, the current route will be used, which is why you experience weird links all over the place. This is solved, as you also mention, by specifying the 'route' param for each page in your navigation tree.

Also, as stated in the manual, if a page uses a route which has required parameters, those parameteres must be defined in the page. In the OP's case, this would be the 'title' param (iirc).

The "required params default/current route" situation in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_\* will be fixed in ZF 2.0, which will also make Zend\_Navigation a bit easier to use (only having to specify params that differ from the route the page uses).

As for the "route have to be specified for each page" situation, this is not unreasonable. If you use several modules in your application, you necessarily have to specify the route each page/link should use, otherwise the router (via the URL helper) will have to make a less-than-educated guess (current route).

I'm closing this issue as Incomplete. I bet 90% of the (unformatted) code is useless to the issue you're trying to demonstrate. Besides that, it's totally vague what the problem here would be (as Robin mentioned earlier).

If you think this issue still persists please open a new issue and make sure to only add (formatted!) _relevant_ code, show the current outcome of your code, and the outcome you had expected, also make sure to test it under the latest version of ZF. Thanks!

Zend Framework 1.11 also affected.

Great decision to close such issue due "unformatted code". Hope Dolf would be punished for closing such major bugs without any solution.

Robin, your comment about ZF 2.0 and fix this issue there is awesome! I am writing to you from 2011 year: ZF 2.0 is not ready, this bug is here, thanx for your lazy work in 2009.

 

 

Posted by Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme) (freak) on 2011-01-10T12:31:53.000+0000

Alexander, let me explain something about ZF. ZF is FOSS, Free OpenSource Software. This means you can use it for free, but it also means that we have no obligation of doing anything for you. See also the relevant part of the license below. Having said that, most people (including Robin and me) are voluntarily/volunteering contributors, meaning we spend our precious time for free on this project.

This also means that when asking any contributor to fix something, you ask him/her for a favor. One of the least things you can do then, is describe the issue clearly, format any code cleanly, and only give the relevant pieces of code, so that a contributor needs as less time as possible to fix it. Instead, you boss us around like we're your employees and like this is the only issue that is in this issue tracker. Let me tell you, both things are _not_ the case.

All in all you're just being rude, Robin already said this will be fixed in ZF2, and I can promise you adding comments like these will not motivate any contributor in any way, or speed up the process of getting it fixed any time soon. In fact, the contrary applies here.

Since ZF is FOSS you're free to contribute. If you need this issue to be resolved quickly I'd suggest you do it yourself, and contribute a patch, so everybody can enjoy it. If you don't know how to do that feel free take a look [here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Contributing+to+Zend+Framework) or to contact me, the community review team, any developer on the developers mailinglist or on #zftalk.dev on Freenode (IRC). I'm looking forward to your patch.

EDIT: {quote}Hope Dolf would be punished for closing such major bugs without any solution.{quote}

Agreed. I should be punished badly. What kind of punishment do you propose?

The last year I've had some major changes in my life. In February 2010, I moved to another city and started a new job, where I'm actually pretty busy doing work stuff that I'm getting paid for. Unfortunately, in this job, we're not using ZF. In fact, we're not even using PHP. As a result of this - and other things I'm busy doing besides work - my involvement in the ZF community has been gradually decreasing. I still read the occasional JIRA mail, though, but I seldom find the time to get ZF things done when I have free time.

So dear Alexander T, would you please accept my sincerest apologies for not delivering on this issue per your standards, and do the fucking thing yourself.
