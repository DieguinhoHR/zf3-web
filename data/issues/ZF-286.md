ZF-286: Problem with RewriteController and params...
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-07-26T14:30:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:16.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.2.0 (29/Oct/06)

### Description

OK, so simple example:

index.php
---------

$router = new Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter(); $router->setRewriteBase($AppCfg->path->rewrite->base);

$controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $controller->setRouter($router);

$controller->run($AppCfg->path->controllers);
---------------------------------------------

<http://server/rewritebase/student/search> ->works ok but <http://server/rewritebase/student/show/id/9> -> go to indexController

maybe I don't understand something, but in RewriteRouter:130 we have line

 
         $actionObj = new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Token($controller, $action, $params);


$params are no set, can someone explain me why? Is it bug?

--------------------------
--------------------------

ok I resolve the probem, but I don't know why it isn't default action

clear code:

- - - - - -

$router = new Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter(); $router->setRewriteBase('/newapp/ap1/');

$controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $controller->setRouter($router);

$controller->run('../app/ctrls/');
----------------------------------

the problem is that RewriteRouter doesn't interprate parameters so I had to add sth like that to my code:

$router->addRoute('v1', ':controller/:action/:id/:id/:idd/:idd/:bookmark/:bookmark', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index','id'=>'','idd'=>'','bookmark'=>''));

and now it's works, but if I want to have more parameters I had to add more key in array....

for me it isn't logic

I don't want to validate with RegEx this parameters so it is should be default action,

adding all parameters to \_param
--------------------------------

ps sorry for my English

It's hard to tell from your examples. Can you provide actual code, real URLs and your $AppCfg settings?

Please use latest svn version which allows for binding parameters the way old router did (in other words - the way you described it).
