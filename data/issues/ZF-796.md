### Description

Docs incorrectly and ambigously refer to setOptions(). Furthermore, some users are confused, and do not read enough of the docs to see that Zend\_Session is actually a component only for manipulating namespaces persisted using the service provided by Zend\_Session\_Core. The docs need clarification.

 

 

### Comments

Architecture and organization of Zend\_Session underwent a significant rewrite, resulting in an abstract class to provide shared functionality / state to:

1) Zend\_Session - pure $\_SESSION[] management 2) Zend\_Session\_Namespace - manages individual namespaces in $\_SESSION[]
