i.e right up where the path is allowed In this instance, the public\_dir is set up as '/var/www/vhosts/fairfax.org.uk/httpdocs/pagecache' for 'Static' backend and open\_basedir is set for '/var/www/vhosts/fairfax.org.uk/httpdocs' as you can see in the error messages.

The problem is in the \_createDirectoriesFor() method which is trying to create all the way back from root even though it is unlikely that would ever be in an open basedir.

Suggestions: quick fix: suppress errors longer term fix: Check if open\_basedir restriction is in effect and then try a match to allowed paths, using a matched one as a starting point for directory creation if found.

fixed in r22644 (trunk) & r22645 (1.10 branch)

-> create directories recursive using third argument of mkdir
