ZF-1479: ::toNumber() returns wrong value

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    print Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(3.57, array('precision' => 2, 'locale' => $locale));


The output should be something like 3.57... but it returns 3.43 for me :)

- svn version: 1.0.0 RC2 (downloaded from <http://framework.zend.com/download>)
- system: Linux Debian 2.6.16.45
- php version: PHP Version 5.1.4-Debian-0.1~sarge1 (Debian GNU/Linux)
- apache version: Apache/2.0.54 (Debian GNU/Linux)
- apache loaded modules: core mod\_access mod\_auth mod\_log\_config mod\_logio mod\_env mod\_setenvif prefork http\_core mod\_mime mod\_status mod\_autoindex mod\_negotiation mod\_dir mod\_alias mod\_so mod\_actions mod\_cgi mod\_php5 mod\_rewrite mod\_ssl mod\_userdir
- php features enabled: calendar, curl, date, dom, eAceelerator (I tried eAccelerator enabled and disabled, but the result was the same), exif, gd, gettext, hash, iconv, imap, libxml, mbstring, mysql, pcre, pdo, pdo\_mysql, pdo\_pgsql, pgsql, Reflection, session, shmop, SimpleXML, SPL, SQLite, standard, tidy, xml, xmlreader, xmlrpc, xmlwriter, zlib
- BCMath: I don't seem to have that installed (tried to use the bcadd and bcmul functions, but they resulted in PHP fatal errors) _I guess this is the cruicial difference between your and my system_
- I was testing with 'en', 'de' and 'hu' locales, they all produced the same output
- I didn't use any extra options for toNumber(), just the number and the locale

Here is the code I run as an example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       for($i=1.7; $i<3.8; $i=$i+0.1) {
           $number = Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber($i, array('locale' => $this->view->locale));
           echo $i.': '.$number.'<br></br>';
       }


if locale set to 'hu', the output is as follows: 1.7: 1,3 1.8: 2,2 1.9: 2,1 2: 2 2.1: 2,1 2.2: 2,2 2.3: 2,3 2.4: 2,4 2.5: 2,5 2.6: 2,4 2.7: 2,3 2.8: 3,2 2.9: 3,1 3: 3 3.1: 3,1 3.2: 3,2 3.3: 3,3 3.4: 3,4 3.5: 3,5 3.6: 3,4 3.7: 3,3

In this example, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 was incorrectly printed.

_My suggestion (skip this if you don't care or find it totally wrong, I am just trying to help here):_ If the developers use BCMath, than probably it would worth trying this function BCMath disabled. I tried to trace the error, and I found that the Zend\_Locale\_Math\_Sub() function is not handling the requests as the Zend\_Local\_Format\_toNumber() function would expect (Zend/Locale/Format.php line 392). While John Coggeshall in his first comment has spotted the error correctly, his quick fix didn't really cure the problem (at least not in my case). The toNumber() function is calling Zend\_Locale\_Math::$sub with three parameters: the two numbers that should be substracted and the precision it should be rounded to. The called function is doing its job nicely, but as far as I can see, the toNumber() function is expecting the number before the decimal sign (floor()). To correct this I have made two changes: Zend/Locale/Format.php line 392

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    -         $preg = call_user_func(Zend_Locale_Math::$sub, $value, '0', 0);
    +        $preg = call_user_func(Zend_Locale_Math::$sub, $value, '0');


Zend/Locale/Math/PhpMath.php from line 76

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if ($op3 !== null) {
            $result = round($result, $op3);
    +    } else {
    +        $result = floor($result);
        }


Since I don't have BCMath, I couldn't try how that reacts to this change, but according to the php manual, the bcsub should return the correct result if only the two numbers are given.

I hope this helps a bit.

Tibor

Yes... seems to work with and without...

Fixed with SVN 5208
