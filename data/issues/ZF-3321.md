### Description

When doing a search like the following, Zend\_Search\_Lucene times out (on my server I have a script timeout of 60 seconds, so I _guess_ it is not related to the mass of results, also since I only have about 100 results there.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $search = new Zend_Search_Lucene(...);
    $search->find('*');


Also searches like ``` result in a timeout.

You can test this bug as well with the Manual Search of the Zend Framework. As this cannot be catched as Exception or such, it is really bad for production sites and should be fixed with the next mini release.

Alex, please evaluate and categorize as necessary. I'm taking a stab at release targeting based on Ben's comments, but you can change this if you think it's not right.

I think this is really necessary and important. Just think of what might happen, if somebody knows that you are using Zend\_Search\_Lucene. It's easy to kill the server with a flood of requests with invalid queries. Currently I plan to write some QueryFilters for the production server. But a good solution would be fine.

Would also very much like to see this bug resolved. Wish I knew enough to be able to contribute myself.

Anyone know the status on this one?

I`m also in similar situation. Any clues when Alexander Veremyev will be able to fix it?

Fixed.

Fix is included into ZF 1.7.7 even it adds sevral methods into API. Documentation will be added with ZF 1.8.0

Hi all. I updated today to the latest version (1.7.7) and found what I think is a bug: querying the index with a range term, produces an error:

"Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception' with message 'Terms per query limit is reached.' in .../Zend/Search/Lucene/Search/Query/Range.php:191 Stack trace: #0 .../Zend/Search/Lucene/Search/Query/Boolean.php(145): "

Code: $userQuery = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse(convertSpecialCharacters($query)); $datesLimit = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse(date:[20010101 TO 20090303]); $query = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Boolean();

$query->addSubquery($datesLimit, true /\* required _/); $query->addSubquery($userQuery, true /_ required \*/);

$index = Zend\_Search\_Lucene::open($this->LuceneIndexLocation); $hits = $index->find($query);

Note: if the time frame between the dates is small (less than 1 year, for example) it works fine.

Tried Zend\_Search\_Lucene::setTermsPerQueryLimit(0) but still doesn't work.

Dario, please add a new issue for that.
