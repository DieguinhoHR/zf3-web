### Description

The current registration only accept the name of the plugin: resources.frontController.plugins.memoryusage = "Mp\_Controller\_Plugin\_MemoryUsage"

One possibility: resources.frontController.plugins.memoryusage.class = "Mp\_Controller\_Plugin\_MemoryUsage" resources.frontController.plugins.memoryusage.index = 200

Hey(!) that suggestion was mine!

Anyhow, functionality implemented.

EDIT: Oh, I commented that already, just didn't resolve it. My bad.

An addition in the documentation could be great. I can add it if you want.

I was planning on doing that today. However, if you feel like adding it, please feel free to do so (that is appreciated).
