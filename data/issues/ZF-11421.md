Clone of ZF-8739 as the issue has remained closed for a while now.

I was able to reproduce this in trunk by running this command:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [adam@zfdev trunk]$ php -r "set_include_path('/path/to/zf/library'); require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php';"


Results in fatal error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Fatal error:  Class 'Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_Docblock_Tag' not found in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/lib/zfdev/trunk/library/Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Param.php on line 35
    PHP Stack trace:
    PHP   1. {main}() Command line code:0
    PHP   2. require_once() Command line code:1
    PHP   3. require_once() /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/lib/zfdev/trunk/library/Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php:31


Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php require\_once's Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Param.php, which in turn require\_once's Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php. That second require\_once of Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php isn't performed since the file is already included, but because it hasn't been fully processed by PHP yet the class Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag doesn't exist, so PHP throws a fatal error when trying to define class Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param.

Fix suggested in original bug (ZF-8739) is to remove

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Param.php';
    ...
    require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Return.php';


from Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag.

Workaround is to manually require abstract class to modify include order:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    set_include_path("/path/to/library");
    require_once "Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Abstract.php";
    require_once "Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php"; // works

The question is why are \_Param and \_Return require\_once'd into Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @see Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_Docblock_Tag_Param
     */
    require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Param.php';
    
    /**
     * @see Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_Docblock_Tag_Return
     */
    require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag/Return.php';


Those classes are not directly referenced anywhere in the code of the class. If I remove those require\_once statements, the errors go away:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [adam@zfdev trunk]$ phpsh
    php> set_include_path('/home/webadmin/htdocs/lib/zfdev/trunk/library');
    php> require_once 'Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/Docblock/Tag.php';
    php> $o = new Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_Docblock_Tag();
    php> var_dump(get_class($o));
    string(35) "Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_Docblock_Tag"


And the unit test suite results are unchanged.

Is there any practical reason why those seemingly-unnecessary require\_once statements can't be removed?

See [my comment](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8739?focusedCommentId=46925&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-46925) on the original bug; they were left over from before the class used the plugin loader for the factory.

That explanation works for me. I've updated the file in trunk to remove the require\_once statements.

Fixed in trunk r24098 Merged to release-1.11 in r24099
