### Description

Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive() uses Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::getParams() and performs comparison of its properties against received list of parameters. But in a case if controller object uses e.g. Zend\_Controller\_Action::_forward() during request handling or if module/controller/action are changed somehow else - isActive() will fail because module/controller/action properties that came from getParams() are for \_initial_ state of request, not for _current_ state.

Correct code would also take values of module/controller/action properties from corresponding methods of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http.

Most likely this problem is actually aboud Zend\_Controller\_Request, not about Zend\_Navigation, but I'm not sure if change of behavior of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http will not break some existing code.

Hi Alexander, do you use the navigation helpers before the Zend\_Controller\_Action::forward is called?

 

 

Posted by Alexander Grimalovsky (flying) on 2012-03-22T12:29:28.000+0000

Hello,

No, navigation helpers are not called. Actual scenario is following:

There is FormController with indexAction() that displays form and saveAction() that performs form submission processing. Navigation page entry is Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc that points on indexAction(). Navigation is initialized in application's bootstrap. Form is being submitted to saveAction() which validates and saves form contents and then run $this->\_forward('index'); indexAction() creates form and then view is being rendered in a normal way through ViewRenderer which in its turn performs navigation rendering.

Point of the problem: you know that Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http actually have 2 sets of information about module/controller/action:

Its member variables that are manageable through setModuleName()/setControllerName()/setActionName() object's methods. These are mean to be valid source of information at any time.
====================================================================================================================================================================================

"module"/"controller"/"action" parameters that are being generated by routing subsystem and set to request object at a time of front controller initialization.
===============================================================================================================================================================

Main point is that second set of information in general case is valid only at a time of request object initialization, any subsequent call to setModuleName()/setControllerName()/setActionName() will make second set of information _out of sync_.

And as you can see in Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive() - it uses second set of information as a source and it leads to the problem.

Here is patch for this bug against ZF v1.11.11 It is tested on real application ad works fine for me

{quote}FormController{quote} The controller name irritates me. This controller handles forms? Or handles the controller some "real" objects like users, customers, products etc.? {quote}There is FormController with indexAction() that displays form and saveAction() that performs form submission processing. Navigation page entry is Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc that points on indexAction(). Navigation is initialized in application's bootstrap. Form is being submitted to saveAction() which validates and saves form contents and then run $this->\_forward('index'); indexAction() creates form and then view is being rendered in a normal way through ViewRenderer which in its turn performs navigation rendering.{quote} Simple workaround: Use only the indexAction!

- create and validate the form
- save the data
- and redirect (not forward!) to the same action (use the [Redirector](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.actionhelpers.html#zend.controller.actionhelpers.redirector) with (e.g.) gotoRouteAndExit )

Therefore, no saveAction is needed.

{quote}It is tested on real application ad works fine for me{quote} This is your luck, but we need unit tests for this! ;-)

I will look at this.

Name of controller and other things are just for example and not real, but similar to real.

Yes, I know about usage of indexAction only, thank you.

However, as I wrote above - source of the problem is not in this particular scenario but in wrong information source that is used by Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc.

About unit tests - I'm not so good in this area yet unfortunately. Will try to improve myself in this area.

Another workaround: Before output the navigation, call on all mvc pages in the container setActive(false)

 

 

Posted by Frank Brückner (frosch) on 2012-03-22T13:59:51.000+0000

Okay, I have written some unit tests. Your solution brings no improvement if the request object is changed. At the moment I see no option to check if a forward is performed or not.

I still think in your application a navigation helper is called too early. Can you create a small package from your application where I can reproduce the problem?

 

 

Posted by Alexander Grimalovsky (flying) on 2012-03-22T14:25:12.000+0000

Yes, I will try to prepare some test case to reproduce the problem, will let you know

Sorry for delay with this example.

Attached archive contains simple project that demonstrates the problem. Please put Zend Framework in path before usage.

After launching you will see indicator of current page ("This is index page" / "This is test page") and simple menu with 2 items - "Index" and "Test". Bold style indicates active menu item.

I've prepared several screenshots to indicate the problem.

screen1: "Index" page is requested and displayed, active menu item is also "Index", all correct.

screen2: "Test" page is requested. Internally, as can be seen in IndexController - testAction forwards control to indexAction so "Index" became current page. It can be seen in page indicator "This is index page", but as can be seen on screenshot - current menu item is "Test", not "Index" as it should be. And it is the problem, this bug is all about.

screen3: It is behavior of application after applying provided patch. As can be seen - page indicator and current menu item are in sync again.

 <?php echo $this->layout()->content; ?> <?php echo $this->navigation(); ?> <?php $front = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $request = $front->getRequest(); var\_dump($request->getParams()); ?>

Well, problem is not in \_forward() method itself, I've explained it in details [earlier|#comment-50108]. There is no need to check if \_forward() was called (however it is also possible to do, but just doesn't have any sense), instead navigation should use correct source of information about module/controller/action and it will fix the problem. My patch is just about it.

Of course deeper source of the problem is design flaw of ZF1 routing subsystem, but I don't think that it will be fixed, better to wait for ZF2 for it. This bug have smaller scope and fix is provided.

Hi Alexander, I'm an idiot! Have tested your sample application without your patch and also I forgot the methods „getControllerName“ and „getActionName“ in my last code example. Damn! You are right when you want to know the last called controller and action name.

But I see another problem: a BC break! Because all current tests within „isActive“ based on the request parameters before a \_forward() is called and with your patch the tests based on the last called module, controller and action name after a \_forward().

 

 

Posted by Alexander Grimalovsky (flying) on 2012-04-12T14:00:45.000+0000

I'm glad that we finally understand each other :)

About possible BC break: since current behavior is incorrect in this particular case (and it is proven already) then tests needs to be updated accordingly to take this case under control. However I don't know much about rules of ZF development in this area and my assumption may be wrong.

From outer code point of view there is unlikely to be some BC break since module/controller/action request parameters are not used to control current state of MVC subsystem and their direct change have no practical sense from ZF point of view.

 

 

Posted by Frank Brückner (frosch) on 2012-04-12T14:24:10.000+0000

I do not know if a running application out there is affected if we change the current behavior.

But I will speak with the community review team, if we can change the behavior and also write a [migration note](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/migration.html) for 1.12.

Would that be a solution for you?

(By the way your patch doesn't break any unit test.)

 

 

Posted by Alexander Grimalovsky (flying) on 2012-04-12T14:36:57.000+0000

Yes, I think it will be good solution, thank you for your work!
