ZF-8428: Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain should call setMatchedPath($path)

### Description

It is currently not possible to chain more than two routes.Example with 3 routes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('example', array('controller' => 'error', 'action' => 'error'));
    $route2 = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('buggy');
    $route3 = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('url');
    $chain = $route->chain($route2->chain($route3));
    $router->addRoute('example_route', $chain);


The route above does not match "example/buggy/url".

This is because Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain does not call setMatchedPath($path), meaning that the outer chain thinks that the inner chain did not match.

It seems tat this can be solved by calling $this->setMatchedPath($path) in match.

Route doesn't match because 'url' != 'route'.

Sorry about that typo. It doesn't match "example/buggy/url" either. It works if I add the line to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain.

To fix this you have to change the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $matchedPath = $route->getMatchedPath();


with the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $matchedPath = $route->getMatchedPath();
    
    $this->setMatchedPath(trim(
        (string)$this->getMatchedPath() .
        (string)$separator .
        (string)$matchedPath
    ), '/');
