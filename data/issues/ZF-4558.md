### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client::request should allow additional options as second parameter in array form being set that will be passed to the currently set adapters write and read functions.

There might be adapters that allow/need per request options depending on the complexitly of the request/response ping pong, which currently can only be set by destroying and rebuilding the adapter.

Not sure if this has changed since the issue was openned, but currently Zend\_Http\_Client's setConfig does pass options down to the adapter. If an adapter did need additional per request options, either it would be handled by the adapter via the basic setConfig, or would require a call to $client->setConfig() on each request.

Hm yeah, from an OOP way it sucks to have this in request(), i'll close.
