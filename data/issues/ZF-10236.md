### Description

This is more of a question than a bug (well could be a bug). I have emails being saved as files so that I can later parse them for a unit test. And example of the body:

{quote}

=0D=0AHello Brian Strickland,  
  
=0D=0A=0D=0Adept editor has= requested **Department - Editor** access for Department of= Art. A user with **Department - Editor** access will be a= ble to do the following:=0D=0A

<

ul>=0D=0A=09

Update any Department= {quote} ... When I do the following, nothing changes: $body = ""; Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitMessage(file\_get\_contents($emailFile), $headers, $body); print Zend\_Mime\_Decode::decodeQuotedPrintable($body); But when I do Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitMessage(file\_get\_contents($emailFile), $headers, $body); print quoted\_printable\_decode($body); All of the =0D=0A and ='s get cleared out (which is what I wanted.) Maybe I'm just not using Zend\_Mime\_Decode correctly.

Created patch with suggested fix. Removing this method would break BC, so i've changed the encapsulated method call to quoted\_printable\_decode() as suggested.

Patch had no visible effect on results of phpunit AllTests run.
