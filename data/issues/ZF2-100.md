        Zend\Http
          - Various codeing standard cleanups, addition of docblocks
          - Added tests to ResponseTest for Zend\Http\Response
          - Started refactor of Cookies implementation


changes naming convention for zend\_config options and don't use underscores anymore. Yet Proxy Adapter still uses the old naming convention.
