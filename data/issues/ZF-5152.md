ZF-5152: startMvc("../application/layouts") fails if an instance already exists
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-12-03T09:52:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-21T05:03:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.2 (23/Dec/08)

### Description

Calling startMvc() with a string path before an instance has been created works as expected, however, calling it after an instance has been created causes the following error:

Zend\_Layout\_Exception: setOptions() expects either an array or a Zend\_Config object in /home/jhendric/workspace/SandysWebStore/library/Zend/Layout.php on line 232

Reproduced with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Layout::startMvc("../application/layouts"); // ok
    Zend_Layout::startMvc("../application/layouts"); // fails with error
