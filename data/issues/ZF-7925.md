ZF-7925: Allow spaces (possible other "simple") non-encoded chars in urls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-09-22T12:46:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:42.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Although spaces are not a valid input format for urls browsers often allow them because they are easy to detect and translit.

Zend\_Uri should as part of a "lightweight" approach allow to validate such urls and make this option available to Zend Http Client which suffers from this unability.
