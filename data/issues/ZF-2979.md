### Description

The title says it all really. Standard form elements fail XHTML 1.0 Strict validation.

I've added as an 'improvement' because it's not technically broken, but it is a bit of a show stopper for anyone using strict.

In order for elements to be rendered using XHTML 1.0 Strict, you will first need to use the doctype() view helper to set your doctype:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->doctype('XHTML1_STRICT');


This should be done prior to rendering the form. Once you have done so, all elements _will_ be rendered using that doctype.

You may re-open the issue if you find cases of individual element types that do not validate; if you do, please specify exactly which elements they are.
