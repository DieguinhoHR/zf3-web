### Description

Current documentation refers to "importing custom feeds" to create feeds -- which makes it very difficult to understand that this is how feeds are created. This should be better documented, or split out into a separate subchapter entirely.

Current documentation explains and demonstrates the use of Zend\_Feed\_Builder. I believe this fixes the issue to hand sufficiently.
