ZF-8748: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Dblib SQL-Server query leaves results pending

### Description

When executing stored procedure on SQL Server from within loop, subsequent queries in loop return Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 20019 Attempt to initiate a new SQL Server operation with results pending. [20019]

$db = $this->getAdapter(); foreach($data as $k => $v){ $sql = "EXECUTE sp\_DoSomething {$db->quote($k)}, {$db->quote($v)}"; $result = $db->query($sql)->fetchAll(); }

Current workaround is to reconnect after each loop iteration, which is expensive.

I need a small reproduction to be able to verify this, so can you provide:

a) an DDL that is needed, including the table in question and the stored procedure in question b) a script including dbadapter creation as well as code that will rais the notice/error/exception

Thanks! Ralph
