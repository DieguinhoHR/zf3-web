### Description

Not found translations are logged in the translators translate() Method if the translations does not exist.

Zend/Validate/Abstract.php, Zend/Form/Element/Multi.php and Zend/Dojo/Form/Element/DijitMulti.php first check if there is an existing translation with isTranslated() and only if theres a translation the translate() Method is called. If the translation does not exist, the translation won't be logged because of the missing call of translate()!

I've two ways to solve this problem:

- change Zend\_Validate\_Abstract etc. to just call translate() instead of checking if there is an existing translation

or

- enable logging of missing translations in method isTranslated() in Zend\_Translate

Maybe there are more components affected by this issue.

This problem is still open in version 1.10.4.

Reproducing it is quite simple, just create a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select field with a translator enabled and no translation done and add a few values in it.

At line 311 in Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi, you'll see that this code is called :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ($translator->isTranslated($value)) {
        return $translator->translate($value);
    }


and Zend\_Translate\_Adapter->isTranslated() method doesn't log anything before returning false.

So all the values in that select field won't figure in the missing translations log.

Can you please clearify if it's now a failure or not a failure. Both states are not possible at the same time.

You should also note that logging of untranslated messages depend on the used settings for Zend\_Translate. Per default log is NOT enabled because you must attach a log where Zend\_Translate can write to.

Logging of untranslated messages is activated in my test case.

My opinion is that it's a failure because it works for every other Zend components, examples: input's labels, standard translation, etc... But not in a few cases listed above or in the cloned issue.

I am not talking about optimization or if we should use the isTranslated method. But only about the final result: no log entries for untranslated messages when there should be some.

As you said that it's working I will detach Zend\_Translate from the components being buggy.

As you said there's a bug I am detaching the "fixed for version 1.8" tag

Agreed and fixed for Zend\_Form\_Element and Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element with r22322.

Not agreed and no bug for Zend\_Validate. Zend\_Validate must provide the capability to translate the message constants as also the content.

Not agreed for Zend\_Translate. IsTranslated must not throw a notice when checking if a message is translateable.

For me, Zend\_Validate\_Abstract is buggy as well simply because if the getMessages() method is used, like it's done in Zend\_Form\_Element (line 1368, v1.10), the \_createMessage() method in Zend\_Validate\_Abstract is used to generate the error messages, and in that method, the problem is exactly the same than specified above.

See the code below of the \_createMessage() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if (null !== ($translator = $this->getTranslator())) {
        if ($translator->isTranslated($message)) {
            $message = $translator->translate($message);
        } elseif ($translator->isTranslated($messageKey)) {
            $message = $translator->translate($messageKey);
        }
    }


The message is not logged because isTranslated() is used.

To re-create the problem, create a Form with a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text element, setRequired(true) and add a NotEmpty validator. Submit the form with nothing in the field.

Be aware that, if the element already has error messages, then everything work fine because \_getErrorMessages() of Zend\_Form\_Element is used and isTranslated() in not used in that one.
