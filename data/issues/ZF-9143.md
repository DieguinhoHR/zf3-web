### Description

When using Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy, Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket code will spew out E\_NOTICE messages about $config['sslusecontext'] not being defined. This is reproducible by simply running the Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy unit tests.

trunk's code was fixed. But, it seems to be not merged in release 1.10 branch. [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.10/library/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Proxy.php)

This was not merged into 1.10 branch, and should be.

Many apologies, this is now merged to the 1.10 branch in rev. 22435.
