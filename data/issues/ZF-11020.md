All into the title.

Zend\_Session\_Namespace borrows its behavior from $\_SESSION. Why not push it a little bit farer implementing ArrayAccess ?

Patch to come

Please take a look at the ZF2 implementation. :)

I'm not sure it makes sense to make this change in ZF1 at this point, as it introduces additional use cases, and thus makes learning the component slightly harder.

Lol, I expected such an answer.

Anyway, here is the patch. So easy to make... Took me 5 minutes, so I attached it :)

But I forgot, it only works for 5.3.4 where we can return by reference throught offsetGet().

I close the issue, sorry

Won't fix as PHP 5.3.4 is needed
