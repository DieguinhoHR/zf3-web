### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/94>

DOCUMENTATION ISSUE

The documentation (section 2.3) states that: {quote} "dispatch() is where the work gets done. This method must execute the action of the controller. It must return either a dispatch token or a boolean, FALSE, to indicate that there is no more work to do." {quote} It isn't made clear in the user documentation how to get dispatch() to return a new token so as to continue with the next action in the dispatch loop. Returning a new dispatch token from indexController, for instance, doesn't work. You must call the \_forward() method at the end of the current action, e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    
        public function indexAction() {
            echo 'Hello from IndexController';
                    $this->_forward('index', 'nextaction', array('param1', 'param2'));
        }
    
        public function nextactionAction() {
            $params = $this->_getAllParams();
                    print_r($params);
        }
    }


Adding something along these lines to the documentation would certainly have helped me.
