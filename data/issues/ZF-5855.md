Meanwhile the bug is fixed, there is a possible workaround how to get rid of this attribute and keep your HTML valid:

$captcha = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha( ... ); unset($captcha->helper);

Patch to add a test and patch the code. Issue was that the captcha element contains a helper variable by changing the getAttribs to unset it later fixes the issue. Changing the scope of the $helper could also fix the intended issue.
