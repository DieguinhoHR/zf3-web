ZF-10742: Invalid translator specified in Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter->setTranslator()

### Description

I am using Zend Framework 2.0.0dev1 with the translator resource plugin. When creating a Zend\\Form\\Element\\File, \\Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter->setTranslator() triggers a warning: "Exception caught by form: Invalid translator specified".

This is happening due to \\Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter (1115). Instead of "\\Zend\\Translator\\Adapter\\Adapter", the adapter is actually an instance of "\\Zend\\Translator\\Adapter". Removing the extra "\\Adapter" resolves the warning/conflict.

Closing as non reproduceable.

There is no exception when calling this code, the line is incorrect and the namespace also works. Probably already fixed in past.
