Thomas,

Are you still getting this issue? I just ran the tests and they did indeed run fine.. do you think this can be a windows issue?

I just tested with the latest release 8008 and the errors are still there. So it must be eighter a php-version or an OS problem.

Thomas,

I am passing this to darby to look at b/c I simply cannot duplicate.

I installed php 5.2.5, phpunit and pulled down r8216.

Changed no ini files, my setup is running stock.. this is what i get still:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    C:\Users\Media Center\Desktop\ZF\tests>phpunit --verbose Zend_Session_AllTests
    PHPUnit 3.2.14 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    Zend Framework - Zend_Session
     Zend_SessionTest
     ...........................I.
    Time: 23 seconds
    There was 1 incomplete test:
    1) testArrays(Zend_SessionTest)
    C:\Users\Media Center\Desktop\ZF\tests\Zend\Session\SessionTest.php:879
    OK, but incomplete or skipped tests!
    Tests: 29, Incomplete: 1.
    C:\Users\Media Center\Desktop\ZF\tests>svn info
    'svn' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.


I am not sure how to proceed since I cannot duplicate.

Darby claims to be able to get the same exact results as you though, so.. Darby, any ideas?

I cannot reproduce, any ideas?

I can reproduce the results problem exactly with PHP 5.1.4 on WinXP, though I'm unsure exactly what's happening at this point. A cursory look gives me some hints:

- Only the last 6 tests do not pass
- testUnsetAllNamespace() is the last test that succeeds
- All of the tests that fail have to do with expiration
- There have been some reports on the mailing lists lately regarding apparent premature session data expiration (indirectly, some reports refer to usage of Zend\_Auth)
- Maybe recent changes to allow destruction and recreation of the session have cascaded into the unit tests somehow?
- Keep in mind the mystery of why it succeeds on some platforms and why it does not on others; there may be a reason for this that directly points to the cause of the test failures
- Examine the Zend\_Session code and test suite to understand it and narrow the scope of the problem...
 


 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2008-02-21T08:44:39.000+0000

The only thing I am noticing is that all tests after testUnsetAllNamespace() make use of exec() to complete their tests.

Is it possible your setup is disallowing exec() or, perhaps php is not in the include path?

Perhaps if someone could see if the test is failing around line 759 of SessionTest.php

I also got the following error from running "phpunit --verbose AllTests" on r8521 of the trunk:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    101) testRegenerateId(Zend_SessionTest)
    Zend_Session_Exception: The session has already been started.  The session id must be set first.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-04-08T12:57:57.000+0000

Fixed with SVN [r9178](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=9178) and [r9179](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=9179).

The problem was in the wrong assumptions about an 'exec()' execution time.

'SessionTestHelper.php' script includes 'tests/TestHelper.php' script with other heavy includes from PHPUnit package. It slows down 'SessionTestHelper.php' script execution time to 2 seconds in Linux environment and to ~35 seconds (!!!) in Windows environment.

Then, testSetExpirationSeconds() failure stops testSetExpirationSeconds() execution and leave session in the inconsistent state. That produced other four failures.

Changes also merged into release-1.5 branch.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
