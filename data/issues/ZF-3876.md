### Description

In lib/Zend/Mail/Protocol/Smtp.php there appears to be a typo: in the helo() function when the client hostname fails to validate, the exception string fails to be built because the method to get the error messages is incorrect (missing an "s"). \\ \\

Solved in SVN r11196. The getMessage() is not found, but getMessages() function exists in Zend\_Validate that was included by Zend/Mail/Protocol/Abstract.php.

Abstract.php is parent of Smtp.php.
