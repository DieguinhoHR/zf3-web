### Description

Hi,

I have developed application using Zend Framework which is working fine on my local system which has UBUNTU but when i uploaded the same on the domain server i am receiving this error:

Warning: require\_once(Zend/Loader.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/nitinast/public\_html/yeauser/index.php on line 12

Fatal error: require\_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'Zend/Loader.php' (include\_path='.:/usr/lib/<a>php:/usr/local/lib/php</a>') in /home/nitinast/public\_html/yeauser/index.php on line 12

Please let me know what exactly i have to do to let it work fine.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks Patanjali Mishra

You need to ensure that (a) you have uploaded Zend Framework to your production site, and (b) your production site has Zend Framework on the include\_path (our quick start, Zend\_Application, and Zend\_Loader documentation all describe how to do this).

I am going to close your issue at this time. If you need further assistance, the appropriate place for this sort of question is on our mailing lists.
