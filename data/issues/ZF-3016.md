Because it's a helper class only for Zend\_Locale\_Format. There is no need for others using this class.

Also Zend\_Math makes hope that it can do good mathematical things which PHP is actually not able like statistics or volume calculations or something else.

This is not the case... Zend\_Locale\_Math was only created to be a workaround for these environments which have no BCMath extension enabled.

Having it outsources to something other than the Zend\_Locale path leads also to problems with people just copying a single component from the framework which would then not work for the complete I18N core, about 10 components.

This is for now unacceptable.
