ZF-8214: Checking for wrong gd\_info() key, was renamed in PHP 5.3.0

### Description

Zend\_Pdf\_Resource\_Image\_Jpeg::\_\_construct() checks if the key "JPG Support" exists in the array returned by gd\_info(). In PHP 5.3.0 "JPG Support" was renamed to "JPEG Support". This leads to the following error: "Undefined index: JPG Support in ...".

Also, the code, which should throw an Zend\_Pdf\_Exception if the index is not found, is never executed, because of the error. IMHO, this can easily be solved by using array\_key\_exists().

Although I'm referencing to 1.9.3PL1, this doesn't seem the be solved in trunk as well.

Cheers! Andreas
