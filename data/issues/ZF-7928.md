ZF-7928: Rest route doesn't work in chains in some cases
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-22T20:06:41.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-19T16:37:12.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.6 (24/Nov/09)

### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Route doesn't work in chains with Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route.

Here is a simple test case:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('api');
    $router->addRoute("api", $route->chain(new Zend_Rest_Route($front)));


The problem is that Zend\_Rest\_Route doesn't set matched path in it's "match" method (which is required for chaining to work). As I think it should behave similar to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module, which uses following code:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    public function match($path, $partial = false) 
    {
        // skipping method body
    
        if ($partial) {
            $this->setMatchedPath($matchedPath);
        }
    
        // skipping
    }

Can you help me by expanding the test case code? How is $router defined?

thanks, -L

Here is a full test case code:

[code] $front = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); // default ZF router: $router = $front->getRouter(); $router->removeDefaultRoutes();

$route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('api'); $router->addRoute("api", $route->chain(new Zend\_Rest\_Route($front))); [/code]

When trying to navigate to /api/controller/id exception is thrown: Zend\\Controller\\Router\\Rewrite.php, line 341: Current route is not defined

Currently, I have subclassed Zend\_Rest\_Route with following code to make it work in chains:

[code] class RestRoute extends Zend\_Rest\_Route { public function match($request, $partial = false) { $result = parent::match($request); if($partial && $result) { $this->setMatchedPath($request->getPathInfo()); } return $result; } }

[/code]

This is trivially copy-paste from Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module

Added partial logic to Zend\_Rest\_Route::match to support using Zend\_Rest\_Route in route chains.

This issue is _not_ fixed in 1.9.4. The code attached to this issue is not present in 1.9.4 or 1.9.5. It appears to be present in trunk but not in the release-1.9 branch. This code should either be merged into the release-1.9 branch or this issue should have its Fix Version set to 1.10.

Patch merged to 1.9 release branch; will release with 1.9.6.
