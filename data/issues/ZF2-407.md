### Description

Or it may be the other way around, that these routes should work but doesn't. Anyhow, there is a mismatch between the view helper and the route resolver. See my SO post here, where I encounter the issue: <http://stackoverflow.com/q/11536962/923847>

I have a route like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'xmlcoverage' => array(
            'type'    => 'segment',
            'options' => array(
                    'route' => '/xml/coverage[/:action][/:id]',
                    'constraints' => array(
                            'action' => '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*',
                            'id'     => '[0-9]+',
                    ),
                    'defaults' => array(
                            'controller' => 'modulename/xmlcoverage',
                            'action'     => 'index',
                    ),
            ),
    ),


I use the url view helper like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->url('xmlcoverage', array('action' => 'index', 'id' => $someid))


This gives me xml/coverage/33 which crashes. "The requested controller was unable to dispatch the request." I believe an id after the controller should map to index action, but it does not. But if it does not, at least the url helper should make the url work, like xml/coverage/index/33
