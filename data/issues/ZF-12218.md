### Description

As discussed during one of the IRC meetings, the ZF pregenerated classmap probably won't be part of the release, so the docs need to be updated.

Zend\_Loader-ClassMapAutoloader.xml

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        In order to use the ClassMapAutoloader, you first need class
        maps. Zend Framework ships with a class map per component or, if you grabbed the entire
        ZF distribution, a class map for the entire Zend Framework. These maps are typically in
        a file named .classmap.php within either the "Zend" directory, or
        an individual component's source directory.
