ZF2-81: E\_STRICT error in Mvc\\Bootstrap "Redefining already defined constructor for class Zend\\Mvc\\Bootstrap"

### Description

(Zend\\Mvc is not a valid component, according to the input box on this ticket form)

Strict standards: Redefining already defined constructor for class Zend\\Mvc\\Bootstrap in /www/fdev/Libraries/Zend/Mvc/Bootstrap.php on line 88.

Zend\\Mvc\\Bootstrap cannot implement interface Bootstrapper without throwing E\_STRICT notice. The interface requires a method "bootstrap" which is the name of the constructor for the class "Bootstrap" (in addition to \_\_construct() ) Thus, the error "redifining already defined constructor".

Fixing this will require renaming the class, or the interface method, Which implies updating the QuickStart guide as one of the two lines below will have to be updated to meet this fix. " $bootstrap = new Zend\\Mvc\\Bootstrap($moduleManager); $bootstrap->bootstrap($application); "

Which version of PHP is raising this?

This appears to have been fixed in 5.3.3 / 5.2.14.

Since we're targeting 5.3.3+ for ZF2, I'd say this is not an issue.

This only affects versions of PHP below ZF2's target version (5.3.3).
