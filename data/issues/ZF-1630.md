ZF-1630: Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http setRequestUri change breaks routing

### Description

For those who experience this issue the MVC will not work.

According to Matthew the check for redirect\_url was added recently for those who are using apache's 404 handling to route requests, or using the passthrough (PT) flag in one mod\_rewrite rule to pass to another and it is breaking the routing on my dreamhost account. I hacked Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http public function setRequestUri to resolve my issue by checking for the $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'] before the $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URL']. Matthew indicated that the problem is that if we flip-flop the checks, then using 404 handling multiple rewrite rules would pose issues.

I am not the only person having this problem and have directed some others to perform the hack until this is resolved. They do seem to be dreamhost users, and I'm not sure if this is a dreamhost issue. One of the reason's I chose dreamhost was because they

Actual requested URI = ANY $\_SERVER['REDIRECT\_URL'] = '/index.php' $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'] = '/'

["SCRIPT\_URL"]=> string(1) "/" ["REDIRECT\_STATUS"]=> string(3) "200" ["ORIG\_PATH\_INFO"]=> string(10) "/index.php" ["SCRIPT\_NAME"]=> string(10) "/index.php" ["PHP\_SELF"]=> string(10) "/index.php" ["REQUEST\_URI"]=> string(1) "/" ["REDIRECT\_URL"]=> string(10) "/index.php"

Here are my earlier post to try to resolve this:

If you need access to my dreamhost account or you'd like me to test something let me know.

This has already been addressed and resolved; see ZF-1439. I updated yesterday, and the base HTTP request object now works as it has before, but an additional 'Apache404' object has been added to address the original request in ZF-1439.

Please test against SVN.
