### Description

This does not work in postgresql

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS zend_paginator_row_count FROM users  order by name asc

You shoud shoul also reset order by

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rowCount   = clone $this->_select;
    $rowCount->reset(Zend_Db_Select::COLUMNS)
                  ->reset(Zend_Db_Select::ORDER)
