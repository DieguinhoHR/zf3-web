Please add a function backtrace from xdebug error output.

There is something fishy here.. Need more info.

Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php is only ~235 lines long, not 929

Need more information, please submit and we can reopen. Also it looks perhaps like you are making and enlessly recursive call in the delete method, that could be the issue.

change your function name from delete to something like remove()
