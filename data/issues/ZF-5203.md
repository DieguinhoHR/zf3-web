### Description

Zend\_Date::get() uses substr() to return dates formatted as Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_NARROW, which obviously doesn't work with multibyte character sets (as long it has not been overloaded with mb\_substr).

The following snippets should put out multibyte characters in UTF-8 contexts, but Zend\_Date::get() returns a byte > 127 which is an invalid UTF-8 sequence and will get displayed as "ï¿½" in most environments.

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-12-10');
    echo $date->get(Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_NARROW, 'pl');

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-12-11');
    var_dump($date->get(Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_NARROW, 'cs'));

The issue can be fixed in Zend/Date.php:839
