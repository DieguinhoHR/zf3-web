The regular expression that matches the description from the @param tags in the DocBlock section of a function or method is broken.

The regular expression has an extraneous caret (^) symbol in it that needs to be removed in order for the expression to work properly.

Attached is a patch that achieves this.

It may be duplicate of ZF-6996.

After having read [ZF-6996](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6996), I would have to concur that this issue is in fact a duplicate.

Fixed in trunk and 1.10 release branch.
