ZF-9385: REST-Route should allow multiple IDs or at least additional parameters

### Description

If I call something like this ``` on a RESTful Controller I would expect, that "123" is my ID and "abc" is something else (a secondary/subsequent ID), instead "123" its the key with "abc" as value and "id" is missing at all. The ID should not get lost here and the additional parameters ... I would prefer, that they are just numbered ;) But at least the usual behaviour (/key1/value1/key2/value2) should start behind the id-parameter.
