### Description

At now you cannot call helo function more than one in one session. If you do you get an 'Cannot issue HELO to existing session' exception.

But in RFC 2821 4.1.1 is writen:

The MAIL command (or the obsolete SEND, SOML, or SAML commands) begins a mail transaction. Once started, a mail transaction consists of a transaction beginning command, one or more RCPT commands, and a DATA command, in that order. _A mail transaction may be aborted by the RSET (or a new EHLO) command._

Normally you'd use Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp, which does send an RSET in \_sendMail() if the connection has been used before. If want to use the protocol class directly call rset() to reset the connection before sending an other HELO.
