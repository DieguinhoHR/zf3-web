### Description

Under ??15.2.6. Putting it together??, in the first example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->setAction('/usr/login')
         ->setMethod('post');


The controller name should be ??user??, not ??usr?? because in the next example we see:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class UserController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    ...
