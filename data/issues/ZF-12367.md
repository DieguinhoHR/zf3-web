### Description

The class tries to load incompatible magic.mime (since PHP 5.3.11 there is a new libmagic version), causing errors thrown by magic, for example: finfo\_open() [<function.finfo-open>]: Warning: string extension `B' invalid and about thousand more similar to this one.

A simialr issue was mentioned in this ticket: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10461>, but it never got fixed. I suggest that solution from Jarek Nowisz should be included in ZF 1.11. I tested it and it works.

"Beginning with version 5.3.0, finfo is part of PHP and uses internal magic file, ZF should not try to load it."
