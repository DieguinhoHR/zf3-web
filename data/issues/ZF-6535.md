### Description

If you look at the documentation you see that there are some examples with resourcePaths configured in the config but this isnt correct to setup the pluginloader correct with prefix path. Its pluginPath, should be fixed.

This has been reported previously, and is already fixed in current trunk and the 1.8 release branch; the site will be updated to reflect this with the 1.8.1 release.
