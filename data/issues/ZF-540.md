ZF-540: Expose \_encodeHeader() as a public static method
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, it is very hard to add encoded headers using addHeader(). This can be easily solved if the \_encodeHeader() method would be exposed as a public static method.

This is very useful for adding headers like 'reply-to'.

Correct typo error in summary.

Hi Shahar - what's the difficult with addHeader()? Is it incorrectly encoding part of the header? Or did you want to add pre-encoded headers for some reason?

Sorry for not getting back on this for a long period - I reported this a while back ago when I tried encoding a reply-to header and it seemed difficult to do. Looking at Zend\_Mail now, it seems to be much easier - maybe the code has changed since or maybe I missed something back then. Apparently nobody else but me had such issues ;)

I suggest closing this bug for now - if I even encounter issues again I will reopen it.
