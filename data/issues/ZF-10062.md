ZF-10062: writerNamespace/filterNamespace not working

### Description

The manual for Zend\_Log said that you can specify writerNamespace and filterNamespace, but they don't work because Zend\_Log->\_constructWriterFromConfig() and the Zend\_Log->\_constructFilterFromConfig() do not pass the specified namespace to the Zend\_Log->\_constructFromConfig().

I also see there are no $writerName and $filterName defined in the \_constructWriterFromConfig() and the \_constructFilterFromConfig().

[Reproduced](http://pastebin.com/DU4BwmRt) perhaps have forgotten the return in method of factory (writer or filter). _new self()_. About the variables undefined already was resolved.

Thanks by your report.
