### Description

I have a stored procedure "test\_procedure" which will execute 3 select statements and returns 3 result sets. I can able to get all 3 result sets by using PHP native mysqli methods. But I could not achieve the same using Zend DB.

Code using Zend DB

$stmt=$db->prepare("call test\_procedure(?,?,?)"); $stmt->execute(array(1,2,3)); $results = $stmt->fetchAll();

Is there any limitations in Zend DB adapter. then, is it possible to call native mysqli methods through Zend DB adapter.
