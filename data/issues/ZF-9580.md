### Description

class: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormErrors method: formErrors param: $errors may be either a string or an array

The code to format the html casts to an array, but this should be done before escaping (the code directly above and probably added in a later stadium).

I am experiencing a bug related to this.

I am using $form->renderErrors() to display form errors in my view and I also added the Error decorator to the form ($form->addDecorator('Errors');)

In my case $errors = array('formfieldname'=>array('isEmpty'=>'Value is required and can't be empty'));

When Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormErrors on L:79 it iterates through $errors to escape them, it will pass an array to $this->view->escape and not return correctly

In Zend\_View\_Abstract on L:897 it should exception if the $var supplied is not a string since 'htmlspecialchars', 'htmlentities' only accepts a string as their first parameter.
