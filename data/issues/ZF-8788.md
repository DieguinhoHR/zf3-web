ZF-8788: Reader fails to return original URI for getFeedLink() if the feed doesn't contain a self-referencing URI

### Description

The method getFeedLink() returns null if the feed doesn't carry its own URI address. It should return the original URI provided by the user instead since we know this is valid and does point to this feed.

Fixed in r22092. Thanks for the report! I've added new Feed level setOriginalSourceUri/getOriginalSourceUri methods to track/set/get original source URLs of feeds. This is set when importing from any URI, and can also be manually set (if needed) when importing from a non-URI source.
