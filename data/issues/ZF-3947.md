### Description

I have a Java based XMLRPC server which sends back a struct from a method call. In this struct there can be many key/value pairs where the value is a blank string.

These blank strings don't get added to the returned struct (array). The check 'empty($member->value)' is catching this case and preventing the value from being added to the struct. From reading the spec this is perfectly valid. An example XML (part) output is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    address

which should be valid because if no type is defined in between then string is assumed. (Similar discussion <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1364>)

The relavent code is Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php:371

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                   // Parse all the memebers of the struct from the XML string
                   // (simple xml element) to Zend_XmlRpc_Value objects
                   foreach ($value->member as $member) {
                       // @todo? If a member doesn't have a  tag, we don't add it to the struct
                       // Maybe we want to throw an exception here ?
                       if ((!$member->value instanceof SimpleXMLElement) || empty($member->value)) {
                           continue;
                           //throw new Zend_XmlRpc_Value_Exception('Member of the '. self::XMLRPC_TYPE_STRUCT .' XML-RPC native type must contain a VALUE tag');
                       }
                       $values[(string)$member->name] = self::_xmlStringToNativeXmlRpc($member->value);
                   }

It seems these two issues are somehow related.

After upgrading to 1.7 I would like to revisit this bug report. This bug still exist and really should be fixed as it causes the silent removal of data returned in a xmlrpc query. The use of "empty" not only discards a empty string (which is valid) but also discards a string with the value "0" (that's a zero)

The @todo needs to be removed because it is incorrect and the "|| empty($member->value)" needs to be removed. This ensures that we still have valid XML (value tag inside a member tag) but correct values are still added to the struct.

I also don't know why this issue has been listed as dependant on issue ZF-3862 as it is not related.

I have raised this to critical because the bug is silently dropping data from a return result which is valid.

Fixed in trunk with r12720 and in 1.7 release branch with r12721.
