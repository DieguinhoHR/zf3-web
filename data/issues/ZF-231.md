### Description

Wildcard route is a route which allows for additional URL parameter fetching like it was possible with the first router version. You will have a possibility to define a place in a route from where all variable and value pairs will be fetched and set as action parameters.

Map 'news/view/\*' will catch URLs like:

/news/view/id/3 /news/view /news/view/show/all/sort/date
