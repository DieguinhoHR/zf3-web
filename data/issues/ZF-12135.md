### Description

Hi Zend!

There seems to be an "f" character before the <php declaration in Feed/Writer/Deleted.php (seems to have arrived in trunk in r24641)

It's also in branches/release-1.11 after a merge. Release 1.11.11 seems unaffected.

It results in slightly corrupted RSS feeds which Firefox doesn't like.

Easy to fix, at least! TIA,

jonny B (from Tiki)
