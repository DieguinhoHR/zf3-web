### Description

In many projects it's really comfortable to use sequences (for example in creating new DB related objects). Unfortunately some DBs like MySQL use autoincrement instead. In some projects like PEAR: DB and MDB2 for these databases sequence emulator was written. It would be great see the same in Zend's DB adapters.

Sequences _must_ be generated by the RDBMS server. There is no safe way to simulate generated values.

Read the note in the following section: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.write.lastinsertid)

Title of the note is "Why not use SELECT MAX(id) FROM table?"
