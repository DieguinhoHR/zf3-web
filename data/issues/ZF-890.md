### Description

Currently Zend\_Db\_Select allows the user to specify multiple tables using the from() method, and the resulting SQL statement uses SQL-89 syntax to join these tables together. That is, they are listed using a comma symbol, and join conditions must be specified in the WHERE clause.

The SQL-99 standard changed the semantics of queries that contain both SQL-89 syntax (comma) and SQL-92 syntax (using the JOIN keyword). SQL-92 joins are evaluated at a higher precedence than the comma join operator. For instance, MySQL 5.0.12 implemented these semantics.

This has the effect that some queries break. Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM a, b LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON a.col1 = c.col1


With the new SQL-99 semantics, this query gives an error, because the "a" table has not been seen yet at the time the LEF OUTER JOIN is evaluated. Thus "a" is an "unknown" table.

The solution is to use SQL-92 join syntax consistently. The equivalent syntax to the above query would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM a CROSS JOIN b LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON a.col1 = c.col1


That is, just replace "," with "CROSS JOIN" if a cross join is desired. If there conditions in the WHERE clause then use an INNER JOIN and put the conditions in an ON clause in the appropriate place:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM a, b LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON a.col1 = c.col1 WHERE a.col2 = b.col2
    
    SELECT * FROM a INNER JOIN b on a.col2 = b.col2 LEFT OUTER JOIN c ON a.col1 = c.col1


What this means to Zend\_Db\_Select is that multiple tables given in the from() method should be treated as CROSS JOINs, and the user is responsible for putting conditions in the WHERE clause. Or else she can use joinInner() if conditions should be specified to go in the ON clause.

Fixed in revision 3320. No joins are performed with the SQL-89 syntax.

DB2 does not support CROSS JOIN.
