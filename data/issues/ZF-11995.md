ZF-11995: Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http uses $\_SERVER['HTTPS'] without using isset($\_SERVER['HTTPS']) causing an Exception within \_\_toString

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2012-01-13T10:28:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-01-13T14:40:54.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http throws an Exception within a \_\_toString-Call. This results in a fatal error: "Method Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http::\_\_toString() must not throw an exception".

On Line 59 in Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http (Http.php) I changed

 
        $ssl = $_SERVER['HTTPS'];


to

 
        $ssl = isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) ? $_SERVER['HTTPS'] : false;


preventing the Exception from being thrown.

Now everything works fine for me.

Have a nice day :-) Tobias

Tobias thanks for the patch! What is wrong with the web server that makes this not work? Just trying to figure out how to make throw the exception. Is it if the endpoint was configured for https but the server does not serve content over https?

If you have error reporting level to show notices, it will show an error when not using HTTPS. See also here: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11783>

This is already fixed in trunk and on the release-1.11 branch, and will be released with 1.11.12; the current patch was applied for ZF-11783.
