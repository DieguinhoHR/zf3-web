ZF-4696: Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket uses strlen & strtolower for no reason when reading chunked body

### Description

When reading chunked response body, Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket uses string manipulation functions and double hexdec() conversion to validate that the line expected to provide the next chunk size is indeed a hexadecimal number. This is not optimal, and ctype\_xdigit can be used instead.
