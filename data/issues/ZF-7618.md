### Description

At the code example 37.11, there is a XML with navigation pages. The XML file defines a root element called 'config' and then a 'nav' element, which contains the pages. Then, following it there is a piece of code showing how to setup a container from a XML config file. The Zend\_Navigation constructor accepts the second parameter as the section of config file to use and in the example is defined as 'nav'. I tried the code, but it didn't work. So I verified that the second parameter should be the root element of the XML file. You can assure that I am right or wrong.
