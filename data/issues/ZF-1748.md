IMHO, there is no bug here :

because of these lines (300:305) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($bool1) {
                if ($bool2) {
                    return serialize($var);
                }
                return '';
            }


for example with arrayName = 'Get', $bool1 = cache\_with\_get\_variables (if true, cache is still on even if there are some variables in this superglobal array)

so \_makePartialId() will return false only if $\_GET is not empty

so \_makeId() will return false and the cache won't be used

(everything normal for me)

may you provide a complete example of what you do with Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page ?

I have found my mistake. In a browser have been set Cookie, therefore caching did not work. Now I use default\_options for installation of necessary options.

Thanks.
