### Description

$params = array ('host' => '127.0.01', 'username' => 'user', 'password' => 'pass', 'dbname' => 'databasename');

In the Oracle adapter, you look for key 'database', not 'dbname'

Svetlin, can you be more specific where you see this incorrect usage? I cannot find it.

Zend->library->Db->Adapter->Oracle.php

- @todo fix inconsistency between "database" used here and "dbname" use elsewhere

protected $\_config = array( 'database' => null, 'username' => null, 'password' => null, );

Thank you, I see the problem now. I will make this change, test, and release it in the near future.

To protect backward compatibility, for one release the 'dbname' key will take the value of the 'database' key if the latter is present and the former is not. An E\_USER\_NOTICE error will be generated. Then in a later release, this behavior will be removed and the user must use 'dbname'.

Fixed in revision 2801. Fix was in ZF 0.7.0.
