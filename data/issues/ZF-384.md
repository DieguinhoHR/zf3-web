### Description

I want to build a website which has many sections common to all pages (headers, footers, menu, etc). I wanted to know what is the suggested pattern under the Zend Framework to minimise duplication when dealing with a controller-action request.

Do you suggest that: 1) within each controller-action method, I make explicit calls to the controller functions for each of the common sections, or 2) I have a single controller-action (e.g. indexController::indexAction ) which builds up the common parts of the site (e.g. header, footer, etc), then it dispatches to the specific controller action the user requested 3) I run my specific controller action the user requested, then dispatch to a single controller-action to build the common part of the page?

Thanks Alp

The Zend Framework strives for flexibility. The choices listed above are all possible with the Zend Framework. I suggest discussing these issues with [those who write and maintain ZF tutorials](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/q).

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
