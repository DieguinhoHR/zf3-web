ZF-10889: CLONE - Update all docblocks to use consistent copyright/license header. Version: 2011

### Description

There are quite a few code files throughout the library, tests, and incubator that have an inconsistent header docblock.

We need to have a single canonical header docblock that correctly describes the copyright and license for the code, and we need to make that docblock present in all files for PHP code, tests, scripts, etc.

Should be fixed in trunk, branch, incubator (well how in the standard and extras) and git zf2.

Thanks advance Ramon
