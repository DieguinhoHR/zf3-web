### Description

I need a way to silence the exception thrown when cycle detection is switched on and one is detected in Zend\_Json\_Encoder.

This relates to issue ZF-4040.

The aim is to still generate a valid JSON string even if cycles are detected. In place of the repeated object we could insert

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "* RECURSION ([Class Name]) *"


into the JSON string.

To accomplish this we could use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function __construct($cycleCheck = false, $silenceCycleCheck = false)


or convert $\_cycleCheck to an integer and introduce a Zend\_Json\_Encoder::SILENT\_CYCLE\_CHECK constant to avoid a new constructor/method argument.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Json_Encoder::encode($value, Zend_Json_Encoder::SILENT_CYCLE_CHECK);

Based on IRC discussion with Matthew we have decided to add an $options argument that accepts an associative array.

The option to silence the exception will be called "silenceCyclicalExceptions".
