### Description

I found what to me seems to be a bug in the Zend View action helper. For a project I am currently working on i use a plugin to set to set custom variables to the request object so that they are available in my controllers. When using the view action helper my variables are no longer available because the view action helper resets all objects in the request object.

See code:

public function resetObjects() { $params = $this->request->getUserParams(); foreach (array\_keys($params) as $key) { $this->request->setParam($key, null); }

 
        $this->response->clearBody();
        $this->response->clearHeaders()
                       ->clearRawHeaders();


}

Shouldn't this function just reset the default objects and not any other variables i set in the request object. The view action helper should just display that specific action and you should not lose functionality of your app. Functionality as variables set beforehand.

That seems logical to me. Please correct me if I am wrong. I would love to see this fixed in the next mini release if it truly is a bug.

It's its design.

Besides, you shouldn't be using the action viewhelper since it's bad (read: REAL BAD) practice. You should also read [http://rmauger.co.uk/2009/03/â€¦](http://www.rmauger.co.uk/2009/03/why-the-zend-framework-actionstack-is-evil/) and ZF-5840.
