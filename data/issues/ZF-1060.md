ZF-1060: Some Zend\_Db classes do not load Zend\_Db class dependency
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Sqlite does not load the Zend\_Db class, on which it depends; e.g., Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ALL. This means that if a developer wishes to instantiate the adapter class directly, instead of using Zend\_Db::factory(), then the developer must add an extra require\_once 'Zend/Db.php';

All the Adapter classes extend Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, which requires Zend\_Db.

I've added the needed require statements to the following classes which also reference Zend\_Db constants: - Zend\_Db\_Statement (which takes care of its subclasses too) - Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract - Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract
