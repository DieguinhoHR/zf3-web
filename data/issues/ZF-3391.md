### Description

When tempting to use the Auth\_openId adapter with a Yahoo! openId, the authentification fails it works well with other providers (at least openid.com), and some other frameworks work well with Yahoo

A guy here found a solution by modifying directly the Zend class : [http://nabble.com/Zend\_OpenId-fails-for-yahoo-openâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_OpenId-fails-for-yahoo-openid-td15910120.html#a15910120)

Because other openIds classes manage to deal with yahoo, and after reading the comment of this guy, it would be worth either to be less strict, either having Yahoo! changing their code ... having worked there, I suggest the first solution :)

I set the priority to blocker, since Y! virtually represents 2 third of the openId accounts out there, and that prevents me to use this Zend class at all..
