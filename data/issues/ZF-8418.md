ZF-8418: Provide unified "execute on connect" option for DB adapters

### Description

Along the lines of PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_INIT\_COMMAND, I'd like to see a unified option to specify a query / command or set of commands to execute upon connection of a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract instance.

I think this would be reasonably easy to implement as a hook into the abstract \_connect() method.

My use case is for setting the NLS\_DATE\_FORMAT in Oracle connections. At the moment, I'm setting this as soon as the adapter is initialised, thus forcing a connection even if not required, eliminating any lazy loading goodness.

There are of course other applications for such a feature, the above is just an example of where I'd use it.
