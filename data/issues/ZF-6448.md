ZF-6448: Incorrect handling of UTF-8 strings while formatting numbers

### Description

This code:

$zCurrency = new Zend\_Currency('USD'); echo $zCurrency->toCurrency(22.79);

Results in this output:

$22.790

Note additional trailing zero. This appears to be related to the multibyte string configurations of PHP. We are configured for UTF-8 across all components including the iconv PHP extension. The specific problem is with the iconv\_strpos function call in Zend/Local/Format.php:430-433:

 
        }
        if (iconv_strpos($number, '-') !== false) {
            $number = iconv_substr($number, 1);
        }
        $group  = iconv_strrpos($format, ',');
        $group2 = iconv_strpos ($format, ',');
        $point  = iconv_strpos ($format, '0');
        // Add fraction
        $rest = "";
        if (($value < 0) && (strpos($format, '.'))) {
            $rest   = substr(substr($format, strpos($format, '.') + 1), -1, 1);
        }


When changed to:

 
        }
        if (iconv_strpos($number, '-') !== false) {
            $number = iconv_substr($number, 1);
        }
        $group  = mb_strpos($format, ',');
        $group2 = mb_strpos($format, ',');
        $point  = mb_strpos($format, '0');
        // Add fraction
        $rest = "";
        if (($value < 0) && (strpos($format, '.'))) {
            $rest   = substr(substr($format, strpos($format, '.') + 1), -1, 1);
        }


Changes the output of the above code snippet to:

$22.79

Which is the expected correct value.

We're using PHP v5.2.8, iconv 2.3.4. Here are the relevant sections of our PHP ini file:

[iconv] iconv.input\_encoding = UTF-8 iconv.internal\_encoding = UTF-8 iconv.output\_encoding = UTF-8

[mbstring] mbstring.language = neutral mbstring.internal\_encoding = UTF-8 mbstring.http\_input = auto mbstring.http\_output = UTF-8 mbstring.encoding\_translation = On mbstring.detect\_order = auto mbstring.func\_overload = 0

Please note that the iconv\_strpos function is used in many other places in that file, so it's likely that other bugs exist that either our code path isn't transversing or simply haven't been detected yet. For what it's worth, we detected this bug as part of an upgrade process between 1.7.4 and 1.7.8.

I'm not able to reproduce your behaviour. Can you give some additional details ?

Also to note that mbstr\* is depreciated because it's not available in most of the installations per default. Iconv is installed per default. So mbstr\* must not be used for the I18N core.

Darn it! I totally forgot I pulled a hotfix for this bug: ZF-6208 and applied it to my ZF install. I nuked out everything and republished 1.7.8 and this works correctly now.

Sorry to report a bug that someone else found and already fixed. :/

Please close this report.

Closing due to being duplicate of already fixed issue
