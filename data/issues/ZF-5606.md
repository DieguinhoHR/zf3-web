### Description

on line 240: $adapterName = strtolower($adapterNamespace . '_' . $adapter); $adapterName = str\_replace(' ', '_', ucwords(str\_replace('\_', ' ', $adapterName)));

This code make ZendX\_Db\_Adapter\_Firebird to become Zendx\_Db\_Adapter, which can't be found on Linux...

Also problem for user's Db libraries.

Now can be soluted by using standard inicialization without ::factory() method, but it is a bug....

Have got the same problem: a self defined Db adapter has to be used, but the namespace has 3 big letters (abbreviation of the project's name)

This patch doesn't create the adapter name properly. Say if you're using PDO\_MYSQL you end up looking for Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_PDO\_MYSQL, in directory Zend/Db/Adapter/PDO/MYSQL.php. This doesn't exist in case-sensitive operating systems.

You have to strtolower() the adapter before using ucwords() on it, for example: line 247: $adapterName .= str\_replace(' ', '_', ucwords(strtolower(str\_replace('_', ' ', $adapter))));

Never mind, looks like that's the whole point of this patch. Beware that there are lots of examples out there using all-uppercase adapter names in one's application.ini file. This may break a few projects.
