### Description

I'm developing an application that uses a transactional RDBMS (PostgreSQL) and also stores data in the filesystem (for efficiency), and may also need to duplicate data to a legacy non-transactional database.

Anyway, this raises the need for function calls after a commit or rollback.

I've developed a callback registration system for this in a helper class, but it means I have to make transaction related calls to this helper class rather than the db adapter.

I was wonder if this kind of functionality could be incorporated into the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract class directly.

$adapter->registerCommit(array($obj, 'committed'), args...);

I can merge my implementation into the framework and provide the patches, if you'd be interested.

Alternatively, allow more advanced transaction management by refactoring into its own class: Zend\_Db\_TransactionManager.

Set a custom transaction manager: $adapter->setTransactionManager(classname);

Transaction methods: $adapter->transaction->begin(); $adapter->transaction->registerCommit(array($obj, 'committed'), args...); $adapter->transaction->registerCommit(array($obj, 'committed'), args...); $adapter->transaction->commit();

This could allow much more advanced management for the DBMS that support it, without cluttering the API's of simpler systems. eg. support for savepoints, prepared transactions (two-phase commit), etc.

Assigning Zend\_Db issues to Bill Karwin.

We are choosing not to add this feature to Zend\_Db.

If you have an application with complex requirements for transaction handling, you are encouraged to subclass the Zend\_Db\_Adapter and provide alternative logic for the commit() and rollback() methods.
