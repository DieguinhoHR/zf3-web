The problem is caused by data stored at twitter.com.

Test expects some entries updated in last two days, but they become out-of-date at some moment.

Test is marked as incomplete.

Fixed in r13029: Reordered the tests and created a helper method to insert test data into the test friends tweets to we can test specific functions
