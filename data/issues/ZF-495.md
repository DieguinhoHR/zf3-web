### Description

An ARO was incorrectly being allowed access to a specific context, despite an explicit deny. An example scenario follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl = new Zend_Acl();
    
    $aro = $acl->aroRegistry();
    $aro->add('guest');
    $aro->add('staff', $aro->guest);
    
    $acl->deny();
    $acl->allow('staff');
    $acl->deny('staff', array('task1', 'task2'));


If a subsequent call to $acl->valid('staff', 'task1') is called, the ACL incorrectly reports 'true'. This is due to the fact that the permissions component identifies an exact match but continues to iterate through all its ARO nodes and, subsequently, returns an incorrect score. A simple 'break' from the script once an exact match is found fixes the issue.

This appears to have been fixed by [revision 1475](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=1475). If this is not the case, please reopen the issue.
