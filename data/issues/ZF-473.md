ZF-473: Fails to use extends keyword in Zend\_Config\_Ini

### Description

I use the extends section propriety in Zend\_Config\_Ini. Since 0.2, and trunk version following, It doesn't work anymore.

Example : here config.ini file :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ; Staging environment
    [dev]
    test = mytest
    
    ;production env.
    [production]
    extends= dev
    test2 = mytest2


- - - - - -


    <pre class="highlight">
    $t1=new Zend_Config_Ini('config.ini','dev');
    print_r($t1->test); <- produces 'mytest', It's OK
    
    $t2=new Zend_Config_Ini('config.ini','production');
    print_r($t2->test); <- produces NOTHING, 'production' section is not extended with 'dev' section


It seems the issue come from library/Zend/Config/Ini.php line 137, col 42 where a ';' is to be deleted, to works as expected.

Line 137 is if (strtolower($key) == ';extends') { and should be if (strtolower($key) == 'extends') {

Or I missed something in this new release ?

Hi,

Please see ZF-352 where the syntax for extending a section has changed.
