Would these methods log at a default level ?

So they would correspond to the default log levels:

LEVEL\_DEBUG = 1; LEVEL\_INFO = 2; LEVEL\_WARNING = 4; LEVEL\_ERROR = 8; LEVEL\_SEVERE = 16;

Or would they be used to get information about Zend\_Log?

I believe that they would correspond to the default log levels. This would be just like the Log methods in the Jakarta Commons Logging library for Java.

[http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/â€¦](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/Log.html)

It might also be a good idea to include the isDebugEnabled(), etc. methods.

I think that this would be a good first enhancement for me to work on. I will be faxing in my application to be a contributor on Monday. Let me know what you think.

Sounds good to me, I like the is..Enabled() methods think they make alot a sense.

Maybe we should get the views of the main dev team, or the mailinglist on this ?

Added patch to add these methods:

debug(); info(); warning(); error(); severe();

Also added

enableLogLevel(); disableLogLevel(); isDebugEnabled(); isInfoEnabled(); isWarningEnabled(); isErrorEnabled(); isSevereEnabled();

Considering you can override the logging levels coding fixed methods as this patch provides would not work.

This would need to be given further consideration and have to take advantage of \_set and \_get

Very true :)

Maybe something like this could be done further in the future ?

Assign to Bill Karwin for verification that these issues are resolved by the new Zend\_Log redesign.

Priority alias methods exist in the Zend\_Log class as of revision 4412.
