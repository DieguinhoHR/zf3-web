### Description

Release branch version contains entries, which are not included into trunk. Other entries are in different order.

That may be caused by direct update in the release branch. It should be forbidden. (It's also possible, that something was forgotten to be committed into trunk)

PS [This change](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Zend_Framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/tests/Zend/AllTests.php?r1=16979&r2=17363) of tests/Zend/AllTests.php was made in [cs-17363](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/tests/Zend?cs=17363)
