### Description

The actual implementation of $server->\_errorMessage($objectEncoding, $message, $description, $detail, $code, $line) give very poor control to override. This is not really usable for framework integration (such as Drupal for instance).

I have a FormException, which contain custom data (e.g. 'username' field is required, 'password' field is required). This can be returned back to the Flex application with the $extendedData property on Zend\_Amf\_Value\_Messaging\_ErrorMessage.

However, this can be achieved only if the method \_errorMessage provides full access to the exception thrown: by refactoring to the following signature $server->\_errorMessage($objectEncoding, $exception).

In a specialized class (extends Zend\_Amf\_Server), you can then overrides easily the \_errorMessage method and adds your custom data.
