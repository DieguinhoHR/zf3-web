### Description

The Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_Directory\_Filesystem class chmods newly created files to configurable default permissions, but does not chmod folders. If the purpose of configuring permissions for new files is to avoid getting stuck with files that only Apache can write to due to umask settings, then failing to also chmod folders defeats the purpose. In practice this has meant that we need to use a separate workaround to convince Apache to chmod things so that command line Symfony tasks can also touch the index files.
