ZF-6468: "BlackHole" cache backend
----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-04-29T03:50:58.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-12-22T02:24:14.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

Sometimes developers want temporary disable caching. The easiest way is switch backend to some other. I propose include new backend with name "BlackHole". It is always return true for storing data, false when loading/test data, and empty array for searching by tags, etc... It implement Extended interface for more compatibility.

NB: 'caching=false' option is not equal this backend, i.e. you can use this backend as part of Two\_Levels backends.

Yeah, a Null backend could be cool for testing purposes

Probabry, I think the method getFillingPercentage() should return integer zero instead of array() .
