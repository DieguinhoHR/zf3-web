### Description

If I add an owner with the addOwnerToGroup function:

$service->addOwnerToGroup("someowner@cs.unc.edu", "somegroup");

The owner does get added. Looking at the owner in the 'Manage members" tab shows the entry with:

Joined Dec 31 1969

Delivery Not deliverable

You cannot click the check box (read only) to make changes to the entry.

As administrator in the Google Apps console looking at the group the entry does not show up. If you add the entry in the console interface it clears the problem.

The entry does appear to work, that is you can login as that user and manage the group.
