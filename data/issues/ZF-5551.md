### Description

Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::setOptions() uses foreach to loop over the options arrays. Assume the following options array:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $options = array(
         'locale' => 'en',
         'disable_notices' => true
    );


On the first loop foreach executes _setLocale()_ method which in turn may use _disable\_notices_ option to disable/enable throwing a notice. But _disable\_notices_ option is set on the second loop, therefore an 'old' value was used.

My proposal is to replace foreach with the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $locale = false;
            foreach ($options as $key => $option) {
                if ($key == "locale") {
                    $locale = $option;
                } else if ((isset($this->_options[$key]) and ($this->_options[$key] != $option)) or
                        !isset($this->_options[$key])) {
                    $this->_options[$key] = $option;
                    $change = true;
                }
            }
            if($locale !== false) {
                  $this->setLocale($locale);  
            }

setOptions() is not a static method. It is called at initiation and set when reading the translation file.

To disable notices afterwards in the mid of a script execution is really a no-go which leads to problems in normal cases.

It is not necessary to call setOptions() in the mid of a script. The same applies to the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $options = array(
            'locale' => 'en',
            'disableNotices' => true
        );
        
        $Translate = new Zend_Translate(Zend_Translate::AN_GETTEXT, '/path/to/lang/', 'lt', $options);


I encountered the issue on the test script of my application. I agree that it is not a normal case.

Maybe... but also the second example will not work.

You are giving "lt" and "en" as locale at initiation... now which one should the adapter use ? In this case the notice even makes sense as you are not allowed to set two locales at once.

Behaviour changed with r13715.

BUT: Setting multiple options with the same method call, when these options are dependent from each other is not supported.

THIS MEANS: When options dependent from each other are given you must seperate them.
