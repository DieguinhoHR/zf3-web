### Description

The following script was used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo 'Version:- '.Zend_Version::VERSION.'<br></br><br></br>';
    
    $stmt = $db->select()->from('psvf.STOCK')->where( 'VIN = ?' , 'ZZZ');
    
    var_dump($stmt->__toString());
    
    echo '<br></br>';
    
    $test = $db->fetchAll($stmt,2);


It fails with the following result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Version:- 1.11.10
    
    string(73) "SELECT "HYOLABR".* FROM "psvf"."HYOLABR" AS "HYOLABR" WHERE (VIN = 'ZZZ')" 
    
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Db_Statement_Db2_Exception' with message 'HYOLABR in "psvf" type *FILE not found. SQLCODE=-204' in /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Db2.php:69 Stack trace: #0 /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement.php(115): Zend_Db_Statement_Db2->_prepare('SELECT "HYOLABR...') #1 /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Db2.php(238): Zend_Db_Statement->__construct(Object(Zend_Db_Adapter_Db2), 'SELECT "HYOLABR...') #2 /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php(478): Zend_Db_Adapter_Db2->prepare('SELECT "HYOLABR...') #3 /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php(736): Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract->query(Object(Zend_Db_Select), 2) #4 /www/zendsvr/htdocs/PSIwarranty/zendtest.php(24): Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract->fetchAll(Object(Zend_Db_Select), 2) #5 {main} thrown in /usr/local/zendsvr/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Db2.php on line 69


The following script works OK:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $stmt = "select * from psvf.STOCK where VIN = 'ZZZ'";
    
    $prepare = $db->query($stmt);
    
    $result = $db->fetchAll($stmt);

This error appears to be related to ZF-3011 but not quite the same. Happens with ZendServer CE running on iSeries

Setting Zend\_Db::AUTO\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS => false fixes issue, seems likely that DB2 doesn't like aggressive quoting of tables. Maybe extend the DB2 class to overwrite to false.
