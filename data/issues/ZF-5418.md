ZF-5418: Improve Zend\_Captcha usage example
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Improvement Created: 2009-01-06T17:13:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-27T01:38:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.4 (23/Jun/09)

### Description

It is not very clear from the Zend\_Captcha documentation exactly how to validate submitted CAPTCHAs when using Zend\_Captcha as a standalone component (i.e. without Zend\_Form).

The code example on: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.captcha.operation.html) shows the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // On subsequent request:
    // Assume captcha setup as before, and $value is the submitted value:
    if ($captcha->isValid($_POST['foo'], $_POST)) {
        // Validated!
    }


Without delving into the source code users have no way of knowing that $\_POST['foo'] should be a key/value array containing the keys id (id of the generated captcha), and input (the string the user entered into a form). The comment also references the variable $value, which is never set or used (I believe this is leftover from before the 1.7 changes made as a result of issue #ZF-3995)

It would be useful if this example was extended to be a working example that included a basic HTML form showing the markup required.

Here's a working example based on the one currently in the docs.

Hi! The issue still exists, the docu was never updated

The lines 12-14 say: echo "

 "; echo $captcha->render($view); echo " ";

But they lack the most important info:

The full example for the form is then:

echo "

 "; echo $captcha->render($view); echo ''; echo ''; echo " ";

Please update the documentation, it took me two hours yesterday to figure that out.
