ZF-12048: Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript::setFile behavior inconsistent (based on order of file addition)

### Description

In my understanding, the "setFile" method in the headScript helper should replace all previously added items (the doc does not say much about this). This example works as expected:

$view->headScript()->appendFile ("/\_files/js/foo.js"); $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/\_files/js/bar.js");

...

$view->headScript()->setFile ("/\_files/js/baz.js");

In this case, the result is that foo.js and bar.js are removed and baz.js is added.

However:

$view->headScript()->setFile ("/\_files/js/foo.js");

In this case, because foo.js has been appended before and there is an \_isDuplicate() check first, the call is ignored.

I would regard this an error, because IMHO "set" should replace all previously added content. Suggested fix:

if (!$this->\_isDuplicate($content)) {

->

if (!$this->\_isDuplicate($content) || "set" == $action) {

The same thing happends with headLink ()->setStylesheet (), although the code is a bit different.

I cannot reproduce the error you are describing. This is my code, and output

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/_files/js/foo.js");
    $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/_files/js/bar.js");
    $view->headScript()->setFile ("/_files/js/baz.js");
    $view->headScript()->setFile ("/_files/js/foo.js");
            
    foreach($view->headScript() as $file) {
        echo $file->attributes['src'] ."\n";
    }
    
    // output
    /_files/js/foo.js


which is what I'm expecting. I have also tried this code and works like a charm.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/_files/js/foo.js");
    $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/_files/js/bar.js");
    $view->headScript()->setFile ("/_files/js/baz.js");
    $view->headScript()->setFile ("/_files/js/foo.js");
    $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/_files/js/bar.js");
            
    foreach($view->headScript() as $file) {
        echo $file->attributes['src'] ."\n";
    }
    
    // output
    /_files/js/foo.js
    /_files/js/bar.js

Sorry for being not entirely clear. Try this:

$view->headScript()->appendFile ("/\_files/js/foo.js"); $view->headScript()->appendFile ("/\_files/js/bar.js"); $view->headScript()->setFile ("/\_files/js/foo.js");

foreach($view->headScript() as $file) { echo $file->attributes['src'] ."\\n"; }

// output /\_files/js/foo.js /\_files/js/bar.js

I believe based on the "set" call, it should be

/\_files/js/foo.js

Great, thanks for this.

Please note that the same problem still exists with headLink ()->setStylesheet (), so you might not want to close this bug just yet. If I get around to it, I will look into the code, maybe I can suggest a fix for this as well.

Fixed in trunk (1.12.0): r24878

Arno: The HeadLink problem is a distinct issue, so could you please open a new ticket for that one? Thanks.
