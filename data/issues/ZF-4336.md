There is no Form\_Element\_Captcha\_Image now, so changing component and title.

You could do this with code like this:

$element = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha( 'foo', array( 'captcha' => 'Image', 'captchaOptions' => array('imgUrl' => '/myurl') ) );

by setting captcha options, the values that it has initially are just defaults.
