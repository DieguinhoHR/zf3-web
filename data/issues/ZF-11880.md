ZF-11880: Authentication error when using Calendar library with 2-legged OAuth
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I setup a valid HttpClient using OAuth (2-legged authentication with a consumer key and secret). This is then passed to the Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar constructor but when I call Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar#getCalendarListFeed I get the Exception:

Expected response code 200, got 401 Unknown authorization header

This is due to the required "xoauth\_requestor\_id" query parameter missing from the URI. There doesn't seem to be a way to set this with Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar.

I tried setting "xoauth\_requestor\_id" in the setParameterGet() method of the passed in HttpClient but Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar doesn't seem to use the injected instance of HttpClient to build the request and this GET parameter is ignored.

I have managed to work around this issue for now, detailed in [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7481570/â€¦](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7481570/unknown-authorization-header-while-fetching-google-contacts-using-php-zend)

It would be nice if setting "xoauth\_requestor\_id" was either build into the Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar class or if that class used HttpClient to build the request parameters.

The reason the use of setParameterGet() doesn't work is because of the call on line 638 of Zend/Gdata/App.php which calls $this->\_httpClient->resetParameters(); I am also trying to find a clean way of fixing this without modifying the core files. From digging into the code it looks like it's not possible other than extending the Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar class.

Zend\_Gdata can only be used with AuthSub/Google Data API, and does not support OAuth.
