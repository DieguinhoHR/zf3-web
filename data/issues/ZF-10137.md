### Description

e.g. I want to have the Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberTextBox allow any numbers with 0 to 6 places. in dojo you have to set the places constraint to: 0,6 That isnt possible with the Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberTextBox - setPlaces Function, because it converts the given var to integer: line 135: $this->setConstraint('places', (int) $places);

the (int) should be removed

A range for places can be set using constraints, like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement(
        'NumberTextBox',
        'number',
        array(
            'label' => 'Number',
            'constraints' => array(
                'places' => '0,6'
            )
        )
    );


I'd leave the setPlaces as is and close this as a won't fix. Thoughts?

Agreed -- since it can be done in this way, no need to change existing functionality.
