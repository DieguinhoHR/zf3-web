### Description

Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::getMimeType() is best effort function anyhow. It's not something reliable so it can at least try to be more forgiving to input.

I belive it should do $ext = strtolower($ext)

Doing that it will successfully consider moo.JPG of type image/jpeg and not binary/octet-stream as is now. Cheers
