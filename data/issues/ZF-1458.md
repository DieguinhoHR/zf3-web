### Description

When creating a model that uses Zend\_DB\_Table for a table without primary key i get a notice :

Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in C:\\Apache\\www\\projects\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Table\\Abstract.php on line 652

Did not occur before 1.0.0 RC1.

Easly suppresable with @ but its not an ellegant solution ;-)

Why would you have a model table that has no primary key? IMO, that is not a valid use case.

its valid case IMO.

examples:

table containing favourited items in application should contain only fields like:

userId, someItemId

ive seen many intermediate tables like this in many applications, other use cases can include, table storing keywords with posts on forums, friend bookmarks like myspace, custom fulltext solutions like phpbb etc.

tables like that can be extreamly big so adding primary key is just waste of space i think. and i cant use existing column as primary key because for example in custom fulltext implementation the data may double for words, etc.

It would waste more space to permit duplicate rows. This is certain to happen if you have no primary key.

The correct way to define the table is to declare a compound primary key over the set of columns that form a candidate key.

Zend\_Db\_Table requires that the table has a primary key.

Won't fix. It makes no sense for a table not to have a primary key. Many features of Zend\_Db\_Table require a primary key to exist in the table. For example, the find() method.

Reopening. We should throw an appropriate exception instead of allowing a PHP notice to occur.

Also I'll document the requirement that a table must have a primary key.

Resolved in revision 5113.

Now the Zend\_Db\_Table constructor throws an exception if you try to instantiate a Table class for a database table that has no primary key constraint.

Documentation has also been written to clarify this requirement.
