### Description

As reported by Richard Lord on his blog ([[http://bigroom.co.uk/blog/â€¦](http://www.bigroom.co.uk/blog/zend_view-helpers-in-include-path/)]), it would be useful to be able to specify paths relative to the include\_path. To do this requires a simple change in \_loadClass() to replace a call to is\_readable() to Zend::isReadable().
