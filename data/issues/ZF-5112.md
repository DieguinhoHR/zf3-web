ZF-5112: Incorrect path to scripts directory
--------------------------------------------

### Description

On the "Create a Layout" page of the QuickStart, the code sample for the bootstrap.php file contains the following line that references the path to the scripts directory:

Zend\_Layout::startMvc(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/layouts/scripts');

Based on the directory structure outlined on the "Set Up the Project Structure" page, I believe this should be:

Zend\_Layout::startMvc(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/views/scripts');
