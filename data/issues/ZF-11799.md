### Description

There is an undefined variable in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::putFileStream() (line 493).

if(!isset($meta['Content-MD5'])) { $headers['Content-MD5'] = base64\_encode(md5\_file($path, true)); }

I think that instead of the $headers, which doesn't actually exist, it should be the $meta.
