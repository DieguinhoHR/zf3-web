ZF-10654: Hostname Routes in Load Balancing Environment
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-06T09:53:15.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:29.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

In Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http method getHttpHost is missing check for HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST

a solution would be to add some lines at the beginning of the method

$host = $this->getServer('HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST'); if (!empty($host)) { return $host; }

Can you provide a test case that includes some exemplar headers that would be used to demonstrate this behavior, please?

I am not quite sure how to provide those, since the $\_SERVER Variable depends on the current installation of php and the webserver.

In a standard setup with a single server running a single apache I got

$\_SERVER["HTTP\_HOST"]=> "mydomain.local"

On a load balancing environment i get (assuming the loadbalancer runs under load.local)

$\_SERVER["HTTP\_HOST"]=> "load.local" $\_SERVER["HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST"]=> "mydomain.local" <= but in here we get the header added by the proxy/load balancer

hope that helps

I'd propose to make the $\_SERVER property to use for determining the hostname settable. At least looks like the most generic way to me.
