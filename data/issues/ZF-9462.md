### Description

Pretty much all of the protected member variables in Zend\_Http\_Client are named incorrectly, namely without the leading underscore.

 

 

### Comments

This is due to the fact that Z\_H\_C was originally written before this coding standard was in place (circa ZF 0.2). It cannot be changed now due to backward compatibility with any potentially extending classes that users created.

This will be re-done in ZF 2.0.
