ZF-5780: Gapps.php sample lists wrong arguments
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-02-13T14:19:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-02-26T16:57:22.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Running demos/Zend/Gdata/Gapps.php with no arguments returns the following:

 
    <pre class="literal">$ php Gapps.php
    Usage: php Gapps.php  [] [] [ ...]

However, this should be:

 
    <pre class="literal">$ php Gapps.php
    Usage: php Gapps.php  [ ...]

Specifically, a domain needs to be specified, and the username/domain/password are not optional.
