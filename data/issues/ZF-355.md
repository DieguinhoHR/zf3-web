### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action in combination with Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter

At least in the way I am attempting to use the Rewritter it is possible get the following error under certain circumstances

- - - - - -

Warning: array\_key\_exists() [function.array-key-exists]: The second argument should be either an array or an object
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible that $this->\_params is not an array or object on line 143 due to the fact that on line 105

$this->\_params = $action->getParams();

returned false;

Example:
--------

index.php (NOTES: in my code $content = !empty($content)?$content:'homepage';)

$router = new Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter();

/\* \* Website Routes \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/ $routes = array('component'=>'index','controller'=>'index','action'=>'index');

//3rd level virtual directory $router->addRoute('inventory\_new\_vehicle', 'inventory/new/vehicle/:content',$routes);

//2nd level virtual directory $router->addRoute('inventory\_new', 'inventory/new/:content',$routes);

//1st level virtual directory $router->addRoute('inventory', 'inventory/:content',$routes);

//Root directory $router->addRoute('root', '/:content',$routes);

Now in my Browser I go to the following URLS

GOOD
----

1. <http://localhost/inventory/new/vehicles/mazda> $content = mazda
2. <http://localhost/inventory/new/vehicles> $content = vehicles
3. <http://localhost/inventory/new> $content = new
4. <http://localhost/inventory> $content = inventory

BAD
---

1. <http://localhost/inventory/new/foo/mazda> $content = homepage (\*see note)

Logic still resolves correctly to IndexController/IndexAction as it should but it is also looking for params which do not exist due to (I believe) the fact that "foo" is not resolved in the route and therefore :content (param) is not created which is correct. I have in effect produced a "Virtual 404 Error".

I am new to OOP but not PHP so I am not hear to suggest the best solution.

I have solved the issue with the following

if($this->\_params) { if (array\_key\_exists($paramName, $this->\_params)) { return $this->\_params[$paramName]; } }

This is resolved in the MVC rewrite that occurred for 0.2.0 (see incubator MVC implementation) as the URL parameters are now set in the request object, and defaults to an empty array.
