### Description

I couldn't find a way to pass a new variable to the paginationControl() template. If there's a way, please add it to the documentation.

I.e., how can I pass a view variable to the 'paginate.phtml' template rendered by this call? $this->paginationControl($this->paginator, 'Sliding', 'prevnext.phtml')

Looking to code of helper

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    the last param is for your params (for example) 


$this->paginationControl($this->paginator, 'Sliding', 'prevnext.phtml',array('p1'=>'aasd')) ```

Kamil is correct.
