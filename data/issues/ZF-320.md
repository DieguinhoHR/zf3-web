### Description

On some installations this would make the directory with the specific dirmask @mkdir($this->\_path(self::\_idToFileName($id)), $this->\_options['hashedDirectoryUmask'], true);

because mkdir relays on the umask settings.

Solution: umask(000) before or a single chmod after this.

do you say that we have to replace the line :

@mkdir($this->\_path(self::\_idToFileName($id)), $this->\_options['hashedDirectoryUmask'], true);

by :

@mkdir($this->\_path(self::\_idToFileName($id)), $this->\_options['hashedDirectoryUmask'], true); @chmod($this->\_options['hashedDirectoryUmask']);

?

Maybe, the 2nd argument to mkdir relays on the umask and chmod not. But yes, your solution should work. :)
