ZF-509: [Coding Standard] Class names do not match coding standard
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2006-11-08T14:37:05.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

The framework standard is that the first letter of an acronym is capitalized and all subsequent letters are lowercase. See Zend\_Acl, Zend\_Http, Zend\_Json, Zend\_Uri, Zend\_XmlRpc, Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite, and Zend\_Pdf itself.

The following names in Zend\_Pdf do not conform to the convention:

Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_CMYK Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_HTML Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_RGB Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_ASCII85 Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_ASCIIHEX Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_Compression\_LZW Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_JPEG Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_PNG Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_TIFF Zend\_Pdf\_PHPArray

These should be:

Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_Cmyk Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_Html Zend\_Pdf\_Color\_Rgb Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_Ascii85 Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_AsciiHex Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_Compression\_Lzw Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_Jpeg Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_Png Zend\_Pdf\_Image\_Tiff Zend\_Pdf\_PhpArray

I would also suggest naming Zend\_Pdf\_PhpArray simply Zend\_Pdf\_Array.
