### Description

From 2012-06-01 UA have IDN support, see <https://hostmaster.ua/policy/?com.ua>

For example xn--80aaac0cakkgdth0g.com.ua is valid + registered domain, you can check it by "Search domain name" at hostmaster.ua website.

But actual bugy result is $zvh = new Zend\_Validate\_Hostname; if (!$zvh->isValid('самобраночкка.com.ua')) { foreach ($zvh->getMessages() as $m) { echo $m,PHP\_EOL; } }

'самобраночкка.com.ua' appears to be a DNS hostname but cannot match against hostname schema for TLD 'ua' 'самобраночкка.com.ua' does not appear to be a valid local network name
