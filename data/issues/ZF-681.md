ZF-681: Gdata unit tests should not be authorized by default (need Internet access)

### Description

When I run the core unit tests on a machine with no connexion to the Internet, I get 21 errors from the Gdata unit tests, just because it cannot connect to <a>www.google.com:80</a>.

I think that these tests should be enabled through a flag (TESTS\_ZEND\_GDATA\_ENABLED), and this flag should be set to false in TestConfiguration.php.dist.

This is the same issue as ZF-921.

Resolved in revision 3804, which puts it in ZF 0.9.0 beta release.
