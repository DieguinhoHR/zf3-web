ZF-4623: Create Autoloadable interface to speed up autoloading

### Description

Currently the registerAutoload method checks for an autoload method like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $methods = get_class_methods($class);
    
    if (!in_array('autoload', (array) $methods)) {
        ...


In light of the performance improvements scheduled for 1.7, I would like to suggest an Autoloadable interface, which would supply the autoload method. The following snippet would make this work, while retaining BC.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass($class);
    
    if (!$reflectionClass->implementsInterface('Zend_Loader_Autoloadable')) {
        $methods = get_class_methods($class);
        if (!in_array(self::AUTOLOAD_METHOD, (array) $methods)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Exception("The class \"$class\" does not have an autoload() method");
        }
    }


There are two things to note about this snippet. For one, I'm not sure how much faster the use of reflection would be in cases where the custom autoloader class has only one method. However, this should be faster when used with classes that have lots of methods (like the Zend\_Loader class). Second, I've added a micro-optimization here: the 'autoload' string has been converted to a constant, which is also used in the rest of the registerAutoload method.

Even though it wouldn't be a major speedup, it might be worth checking out : )

Actually, get\_class\_methods() _is_ faster than reflection.
