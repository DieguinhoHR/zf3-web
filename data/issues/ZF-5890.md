### Description

When performing AMF requests over an SSL encrypted connection, no response is given in IE6.

Adding below headers will fix the response for IE6.

 <?php header('Cache-Control: cache, must-revalidate'); header('Pragma: public'); $server = new Zend\_Amf\_Server(); $server->addDirectory( $this->registry->services\_dir ); $response = $server->handle(); echo $response; ?> Fix found in: [http://martijnvanbeek.net/weblog/56/â€¦](http://martijnvanbeek.net/weblog/56/ie7_+_https_+_flash.html) -- this link only describes the problem for IE7 and not specificly AMF, but it also works for IE6

FYI: In holland, SSL certificates are mandatory by law, hence the requirement to perform AMF requests over SSL.
