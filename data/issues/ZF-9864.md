ZF-9864: Zend\_Http\_Cookie does not allow quoted values as stated in RFC 2965 section 3.1

### Description

While dealing with the Asterisk AMI interface, we received cookie key, value pairs which featured quoted values. When using the built-in cookie jar functionality, the cookie was then being reused on later calls in a urlencoded form which replaced the double quotes (") with the encoded counterpart (%22), which did not work. After much research we discovered that the Zend\_Http\_Cookie class does not account for double quotes in values as is specified by the RFC 2965 in section 3.1 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965#section-3.1>) which stipulates values can be a "token | quoted-string". We have modified the Zend\_Http\_Cookie class to simply strip quotes before storing the value. Since I do appear to be able to submit files with this ticket, the patch is as follows:

A better way to strip the beginning and ending quotes is to use ltrim and rtrim. This prevents inner double-quotes from being replaced.

$value = ltrim(rtrim($value, '"'), '"');
