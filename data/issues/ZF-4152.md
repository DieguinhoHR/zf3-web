### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common::\_\_doRequest

should be renamed to

Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common::\_doRequest

with php 5.2.5 that caused a seg fault, most properly due to an endless recursion.

Maybe its a php bug too, i'll check it but for sure this is a bug in Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common.

That took some time to find :)
