### Description

A resource plugin that sets up the caching stuff would be nice.

If we have a cache resource plugin, would this be where to setup the Zend\_Db\_Table meta cache? Or should the db resource handle that?

I'd expect you'd have a separate resource for setting up the Zend\_Db\_Table metadata cache.

I'm going to close this issue as "won't fix" for right now, so that we can communicate on list as to what this resource would look like, and so we can mark the Zend\_App initial release as stable finally. Dolf, please re-open as a new issue that's not parented to the main Zend\_App development task list.
