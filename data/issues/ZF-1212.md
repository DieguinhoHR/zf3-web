### Description

We have a new design for Zend\_Log, that avoids the use of static method calls and provides much more functionality than the old design.

When it reaches a state of completion, please move it from incubator to core.

Remember to move the unit tests and documentation too, and remove references to unit tests and docs from AllTests.php and manual.xml in the incubator.

Revision 4412 includes Zend\_Log moving from incubator to core.

Revision 4417 includes modifications to unit tests and Zend\_Cache to support new Zend\_Log design.
