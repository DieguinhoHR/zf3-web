### Description

We need all pages of the docs to have id attribute (anchors) for all headings, so we could directly link to the specific part of the page. Some of them are quite long so this is the feature I miss a lot.

These id's are already in place? Take a look at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.acl.introduction.html#zend.acl.introduction.resources)

I agree, the id's (anchors) are already there. They are just on the section div rather than on the h1's. For another example, look at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.action.html#zend.controller.action.prepostdispatch)

This issue should be closed.
