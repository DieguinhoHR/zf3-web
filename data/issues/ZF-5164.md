### Description

If the file element is set as not required and in the case it haven't been uploaded, Zend\_Form\_Elment\_File::getValues( )_return the last directory name_ instead of _null_. On my debian box _tmp_ is returned.

\\

Possible fix :\\

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$this->isRequired() && !$this->isUploaded()) {
         return null;
    }
