ZF-486: Standardize Zend\_Db\_Inflector methods
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2006-11-03T21:25:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:25.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

In Zend\_Db\_Inflector, there are the following methods:

camelize() underscore() singular() plural()

Camelize() and underscore() are already verbs, so singular() and plural() should become singularize() and pluralize() (a la the comments above the methods themselves).

A more descriptive, less typo-prone solution might be: toCamelCaps(), toUnderscore(), toSingular(), and toPlural().

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

As of revision 3995, Zend\_Db\_Table does not use inflectors. The class Zend\_Db\_Inflector is marked @deprecated, and the class will be removed by Zend Framework 1.0. Therefore consistency of method names is no longer an issue.
