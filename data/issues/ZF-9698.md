### Description

I've noticed when bcmath extension is enabled the problem with broken precision and number\_format reoccurs.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $number = Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(13547.3678,
                                           array('precision' => 2,
                                                 'locale' => $locale));


returns 13547.36 with bcmath enabled. Zend Server 5.0, ZF 1.10.2, PHP 5.2.12, Windows 7. Correct output should be 13547.37.

Closing as not reproduceable

Using the given code with locale 'de' and var\_dump of the returned output I get

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string '13.547,37' (length=9)


Using 'fr' I get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string '13 547,37' (length=10)


Both results are correct.

Thomas, have you turned bcmath extension on? This simple script is not working for me with _bcmath enabled_.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    var_dump(extension_loaded('bcmath'));
    var_dump(Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(13547.3678,array('precision' => 2,'locale' => new Zend_Locale('en_US'))));


Outputs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    bool(true) 
    string(9) "13,547.36"

Please turn on bcmath extension to reproduce problem!

Using your code I get

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    boolean true
    string '13,547.37' (length=9)


Note that I am running my tests on Windows where bcmath is enabled per default.

I've upgraded to ZF 1.10.3 and problem disappears. (but was still present on 1.10.2 :)) Thanks for your willingness anyway.
