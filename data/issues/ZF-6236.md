### Description

According to the documentation I should be able to call $application->bootstrap('db'); but the bootstrap function on the application has no parameters.

You could call this on your bootstrap class, so then the code would change to: $application->getBootstrap()->bootstrap('db');

This is fixed in current trunk.
