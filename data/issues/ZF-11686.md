@Marco The helper action Json uses view helper json where the header is assigned (see Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json line 77).

Greetings Ramon

@Ramon: Thanks I see that it now works under 1.11.10. I had testet it with Zend Version 1.10.6 were the Header isn't overwritten in the view helper, thats because I only compared the Action Helper.

Bug can be closed

@Marco True this was fix in 1.11.1 with ZF-10675.
