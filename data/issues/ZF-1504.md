### Description

When you call a script without adding the action. ( e.g. Controller 'foo' thus /foo )

and if you in that controller do a : $this->\_redirect('login');

it redirects to '/login'

however if you call '/foo/index' it redirects correctly ( '/foo/login' )

I'm not sure I understand the issue. Your subject indicates that this is an issue with prependBase(), but the description looks like you've simply misunderstood how \_redirect() is supposed to function. Could you clearly spell out the code you have called, the expected result, and the actual result?

Hi Matthew,

no the problem is, if you use the internal action method \_redirect /\*\* \* Redirect to another URL \* \* Proxies to {@link Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector::gotoUrl()}. \* \* @param string $url \* @param array $options Options to be used when redirecting \* @return void \*/ you can pass an options array. One option is prependBase to enable/disable prepending Base for new redirect url. Stack:

$this->\_redirect(...)

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector.php public function gotoUrl($url, array $options = array())

 
    /**
     * Set a redirect URL string
     * 
     * By default, emits a 302 HTTP status header, prepends base URL as defined 
     * in request object if url is relative, and halts script execution by 
     * calling exit().
     *
     * $options is an optional associative array that can be used to control 
     * redirect behaviour. The available option keys are:
     * - exit: boolean flag indicating whether or not to halt script execution when done
     * - prependBase: boolean flag indicating whether or not to prepend the base URL when a relative URL is provided
     * - code: integer HTTP status code to use with redirect. Should be between 300 and 307.
     *
     * _redirect() sets the Location header in the response object. If you set 
     * the exit flag to false, you can override this header later in code 
     * execution.
     *
     * If the exit flag is true (true by default), _redirect() will write and 
     * close the current session, if any.
     *
     * @param  string $url 
     * @param  array $options
     * @return void
     */
    public function setGotoUrl($url, array $options = array())


Line 297 the prepend base value is checked but never used. Same for exit value.

Line 295: - $exit = ($options['exit']) ? true : false; + $this->\_exit = ($options['exit']) ? true : false;

Line 298: - $prependBase = ($options['prependBase']) ? true : false; + $this->\_prependBase = ($options['prependBase']) ? true : false;

just for your notice. :)

No actually what happening is:

When you use a link in the form of only the controller ('foo') the framwork goes automagically to the indexAction of that controller ( thus: 'foo/index' ) but it won't change the url.

If in that action you do a redirect to a different action in the same controller ('bar') it should go to '/foo/bar' but instead it resolves to '/bar'

it doesn't append the controller name.

Yes that true, Paul. Sorry my problem sound similar but is a bit different. :)

Matthew should i open a new bug or would this be also fixed?

Paul -- please read the documentation on \_redirect() and the redirector's setGotoUrl() method (to which \_redirect() is aliased); \_redirect() is supposed to be used with a URI or URI fragment, and does no detection of the current controller. A call to $this->\_redirect('foo') will go to '/foo' on the current host; $this->\_redirect('bar') will go to '/bar'. This is by design. If you want $this->\_redirect('bar') to go to the bar action of the current controller ('foo' in your example), you should use the redirector action helper's goto() or direct() methods: $this->\_helper->redirector->goto('bar') or $this->\_helper->redirector('bar').

The problem I'm observing is exactly that reported in ZF-1460, and that is the one I will address.
