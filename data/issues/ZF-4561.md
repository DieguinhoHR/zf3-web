### Description

When I'm trying to connect with jboss (tomcat) server, sending POST params, I have got infinity loop in /Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php:298-300. There will be only string(0) "" in response to fread($this->socket, 8192), but never false (on Windows platform, doesn't tested on linux).

Resolved using code from php.net documentation...

This should be fixed by now.

Can you try with 1.6.2 or with HEAD from SVN ?

Shahar.

I can't test it for now, but I think HEAD version from trunk should work.

Probably the same issue, already fixed

Closing (probably fixed by ZF-4238) Please open a new bug with more reproduction info if problem persists in 1.6.2 / HEAD
