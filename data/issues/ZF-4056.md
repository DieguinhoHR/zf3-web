### Description

When you run test case using phpunit v3.3, passing dir with tests as a param, you will get:
===========================================================================================

$phpunit dir\_with\_test PHPUnit 3.3.0beta1 by Sebastian Bergmann.

F.

There was 1 failure:

I was talking about this issue with Sebastian Bergmann, he said that making Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase abstract class fixes the issue.

Yes -- I forgot to open an issue for this. We discovered it internally last week when investigating some options for the final directory layout to use with Zend\_Tool.

Fixed in trunk and 1.6 release branch.
