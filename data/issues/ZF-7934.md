ZF-7934: Attempt to escape jsoned data in dijits results in changed content when using Dojo declarativly

### Description

We have done a custom dijit and extend Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_CustomDijit This Dijit requires an array parameter as an argument.

This parameter is supposed to be json encoded:

protected $\_jsonParams =array("queryparams");

When using the declarative style of dojo the following happens if queryparams is set to this:

"queryparams"=>array("x\\"'y"=>"xxx\\"yyyy''zzzz\\"aaaa\\\\"'bbb")

queryparams="{'x\\''y':'xxx\\'yyyy''zzzz\\'aaaa\\\\''bbb'}"

Suddenly the double quotes disappeared

This is due to an erroneous (?) attempt to escape the value:

Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/Dijit.php:223

 
                if ($this->_useDeclarative()) {
                    $values = str_replace('"', "'", $values);
                }


if i remove these lines i get the following:

queryparams="{"x\\"'y":"xxx\\"yyyy''zzzz\\"aaaa\\\\"'bbb"}"

which is perfect HTML and works as expected from within javascript.

An easy way to reproduce that without custom dijits is to use:

$this->editor("test","test",array("plugins"=>array("x\\"'y"=>"xxx\\"yyyy''zzzz\\"aaaa\\\\"'bbb")));

Which spawns the standard editor dijit. Looking at the HTML you will find that the double quotes are gone.
