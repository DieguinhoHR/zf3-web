ZF-4044: Provide ability to change starting array index in fetchAll()
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-08-23T11:28:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:43.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

(This could be seen as an improvement to either Zend\_Db\_Table or to Zend\_Form)

fetchAll returns an array of rows, with the array index starting at 0 (Zero)

If you try and pass this array to Zend\_Form's populate() method, you loose the first row as Zend\_Form can't cope with the array index of 0 (zero)

You end up with code approximately like:

$data = $table->fetchAll(); $counter=1; for ($data as $datarow) $newData[counter++] = $datarow; $form->populate($newData);

Either:

1 - fetchAll() needs to be tweaked to allow the starting array index to be specified. Maybe change the method signature to include a starting array index ? Or,

2 - populate() needs to be tweaked to cope with array index 0
