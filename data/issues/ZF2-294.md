ZF2-294: function prepareStatementFromSqlObject() doesn't exist on current git master, breaks RowGateway

### Description

Just pulled the master from git.

The updated (current) \\Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Sql does not contain the function prepareStatementFromSqlObject() which was there and which is still called within parts of Zend\\Db code. This is at least breaking RowGateway save() function. (And maybe more)

Sorry, but i can't really understand why this was committed before it works as it worked before.

While Zend Framework still in a beta state, backward compatibility is not guaranteed.
