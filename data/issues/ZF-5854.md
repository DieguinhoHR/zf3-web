ZF-5854: Doesn't work with domains without two dots, such as dev.local

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Cookie doesn't work with local domains without two dots, such as dev.local. With the native php cookie method one can use false instead of the domain, e.g. setcookie('key', 'val', time() + 7200, '/', false); to make it work.

This doesn't work with the Zend component. See this thread for a more elaborate discussion on the problem.

I am not entirely sure what you are trying to do - are you trying to replace setcookie() with Zend\_Http\_Cookie? If so that's not what it's for. Can you provide some reproduction code so I understand what you're trying to achieve?
