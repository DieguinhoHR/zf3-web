### Description

-------- Original Message -------- Subject: [fw-mvc] Suggestion: Vary Support in Request/Response Objects Date: Thu, 01 Mar 2007 13:52:00 -0800 From: Gavin Vess [gavin@zend.com](mailto:gavin@zend.com) To: fw-mvc@lists.zend.com

Applications that vary content based on HTTP request headers ought to alert the receivers of such content using a "Vary" header in the response. Otherwise, caching proxy servers might serve the wrong cached content.

An application might choose to alter content based on the request's HTTP Accept header, such as language, character set, encoding, or based on the user agent. For cache control headers that permit caching the response, without an appropriate "vary" header in the response, a caching proxy server normally assumes the response should be the same for every user agent accessing the same URL (considering only HTTP GET in this email).

Is there value in supporting something like the following?

$response->varyByLanguage(true); $response->varyByCharset(true); $response->varyByUserAgent(true); etc.

Then the response object could inject appropriate headers.

Simply accessing this information from the request object could throw a yellow flag that the "Vary" header might be needed. For those who like a little help in big applications, if the request object recorded access of these values, flags could be toggled to help developers decide whether or not to "Vary:" by which type.

Cheers, Gavin

P.S. For reference, here is an example:

[HTTP\_ACCEPT] => text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,_/_;q=0.5 [HTTP\_ACCEPT\_CHARSET] => ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,\*;q=0.7 [HTTP\_ACCEPT\_ENCODING] => gzip,deflate [HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE] => en-us,en;q=0.5 [HTTP\_USER\_AGENT] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.10) Gecko/20070216 Firefox/1.5.0.10

When viewing search results, how many search engines show multiple versions of a web page for the same URL, with each "version" in one of the languages supported by that website? The search engine might make educated guesses about the language preference of the user searching, or it might not.

Assign Zend\_Controller issues to Matthew.

Scheduling for 1.1.0

This should be integrated into the ContextSwitch helper.

Downgrading to "Nice to Have" -- not crucial for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This is being covered by several other issues at this point, and we do not have sufficient feedback or proposed implementation to work on this otherwise.
