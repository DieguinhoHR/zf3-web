ZF-8174: Cyclic require causes a class to be redeclared
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-29T05:35:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-12T12:13:38.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Trying this line triggers the issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common/TextNum/CaseInsensitive.php';


(ZF is in the include path)

You'll get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class zend_search_lucene_analysis_analyzer_common in /path/to/lib/Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common.php on line 41


It has to do something with the require calls?!?

Tested against r18731.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene component is designed to be turned on with one 'require\_once' call:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php';


It's so because of historical reasons (using none-conditional require\_once is faster in some cases), but it should be redesigned.

Use

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php';


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php';


now.

That works, thank you!

Priority is not Minor as there is an easy workaround.

Fixed.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't use any special require\_once policy now.

Nevertheless, all analyzers and queries are included by Zend/Search/Lucene.php, it shouldn't be changed up to ZF 2.0
