### Description

RE: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.dojo.view.html#zend.dojo.view.dijit.form)

It says:

{quote} RadioButton accepts an option {color:red}fourth{color} argument, $options, an associative  
 array of value/label pairs used as the radio options. You may also pass  
 these as the $attribs key options. {quote}

"fourth" should be "fifth" (and "option fourth argument" should probably read "option{color:red}al{color} fifth argument")

The example shows $options as the 5th argument, which is correct.
