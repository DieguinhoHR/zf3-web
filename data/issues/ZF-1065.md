### Description

-------- Original Message -------- Subject: Re: [fw-i18n] setOptions() - format option, opinions wanted Date: Tue, 13 Mar 2007 23:25:05 +0100 From: Thomas Weidner [thomas.weidner@gmx.at](mailto:thomas.weidner@gmx.at) To: Gavin Vess [gavin@zend.com](mailto:gavin@zend.com), ZF I18n [fw-i18n@lists.zend.com](mailto:fw-i18n@lists.zend.com)

> Yup, I purposely committed the code allowing the existing class-wide default 'format' to be set, and promptly posted an example of the related issue to the list. This gives others a chance to participate in design and API changes and easily test. Usually we post these discussions directly to Jira issues for the i18n components.

This is already in work by me, additionally with other small tweaks.

This is what I have in mind and what I am actually working on :-)

With the new $options arrays, and the above, I think we can eliminate toNumberFormat() from the public API of this component by making the same functionality available through toNumber(), selectable using options in the $options array. There is no documentation for toNumberFormat(), so I don't see a problem with this method becoming protected visibility.

I added a new constant Zend\_Locale\_Format::STANDARD which does what we wrote before... I also added some unit tests. Could u add some docu for this feature please ?? ;-)

Eliminating the "toNumberFormat" is not so easy.... I am working on it, but it will take some days to act as expected. Protected visible is not possible bcause users actualy use toNumberFormat to give a self defined format... toNumber takes automatically the locale standard number format. I am changing this...

Hard work... but I got it running ;-)

toNumberFormat has been integrated into toNumber. I will write some Unit tests... docu by gavin ??

Thomas, post example use cases in code here, and I will work them into the docu :)

Hmmm. I suggested simply making toNumberFormat "protected visibility" (i.e. calling toNumberFormat() from toNumber()), which would have been less difficult than a complete refactor/rewrite/merge of these two functions. However, it looks like the merger is done already :)

Rework had to be done by me:

toNumber format only accepted the standard number format of this locale. But with toNumberFormat a user can give a self defined number format.

Now both cases are handled by toNumber.

We should make this clear in the docu... Related useage can be seen by the unit tests which are actually here.

toNumber(array('number\_format' => '#,#0.###')); for example.

I just fixed the last problems with self defined number formats. We have 100% code coverage and all actual unit tests pass.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(-123456.1234, array('number_format' => '#0.00-'));
    // self defined format -> output: "123456.12-"
    
    Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber(-1234.123, array('precision' => 2, 'locale' => 'de'));
    // precision 2, standard number format -> output "-1.234,12"


Many many others can be found in the unit test bed.

Assigned to gavin as only the docu is missing

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-25T17:03:22.000+0000

Added documentation for Zend\_Locale\_Format::STANDARD and for self defined number formats.
