### Description

Maybe I'm missing something, but there doesn't seem to be a way to get ldml/numbers/defaultNumberingSystem using Zend\_Locale\_Data from the locale data files. I've checked over every line of Zend\_Locale\_Data::getContent() and Zend\_Locale\_Data::getList() and can't seem to find any way of doing it.

I could hack it in or write my own code to do it, but I hate having to do the former, and the latter seems like a waste of time considering Zend\_Locale\_Data has all of the fancy caching and processing built in.

I'm currently using 1.9.6, however it appears that Zend\_Locale\_Data is mainly unchanged between that version and 1.11.0

I can use the following code added to Zend\_Locale\_Data::getContent() around line 1149 (in 1.9.6)

{quote} case 'defaultnumberingsystem': $temp = self::\_getFile($locale, '/ldml/numbers/defaultNumberingSystem', '', 'default'); break; {quote}
