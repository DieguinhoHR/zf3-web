### Description

In mssql if you don't pass variable @table\_owner it will guess the table is in dbo schema. So in attachment is a patch to fix that. I'm also using that in sp\_columns because is the right to do. If I have a 2 tables with the same name and different schemas, that will be confusing.

Just correcting, the procedure name is sp\_pkeys.

I am not sure what you are proposing. How do you expect to call describeTable() to trigger this functionality? Currently, the $schemaName is not used in the lookup. Why would schemaName be dotted? What does that represent?

Hi Ralph, there are to problems that patch solve. First: When you have two tables in different schemas, procedures like sp\_pkeys and sp\_columns will get only one. Second: sp\_pkeys need specify the schema or it will search in dbo, if that does not exist in dbo, will return a blank rowset.

And about the schema name using dot is because some times you need specify another database to do a join, because of that we use in schemaName db.schema.

Thank you

Support for catalogs in ZF is also very limited, see <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6665> (similar bug)
