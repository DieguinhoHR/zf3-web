### Description

Hi!

I was wondering if there is any way to link select fields together? So that if "value1" is selected in element 1, element 2 displays only the values corresponding to "value1" of the first field.

For example: - Select 1: Country - Select 2: State - If Country "US" is selected, the right states are displayed...

I think this could be done with some query/filter options in the FilteringSelect-Datastore or something like this?

A direct integration into the framework would be great in one of the next major versions is possible...

Greets, Mat.

This is the sort of thing that actually falls outside of ZF, as it requires custom JS in order to accomplish.

BTW, there is a widget in dojox for doing this, dojox.form.MultiComboBox, but it's not yet considered stable, and there's very little documentation on it. Once it is stable, we may consider it for inclusion within ZF.
