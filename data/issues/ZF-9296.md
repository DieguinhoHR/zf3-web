ZF-9296: init() function of Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Multidb won't execute

### Description

An error _A DB adapter was tried to retrieve, but was not configured_ is thrown at _Zend\\Application\\Resource\\Multidb.php:128_ when trying to fetch a database from the multidb stack.

It looks like the init() function won't execute properly, leaving the $this->\_dbs variable empty.

I think the problem only occurs with plugin resources, not with _normal_ resources (_log_ isn't executing init() either).

Are there known issues with init() and autoloading?

I have found this too and am having to manually init() in the bootstrap:

$resource = $bootstrap->getPluginResource('multidb'); $resource->init(); $db1 = $resource->getDb('db1');

Do you have any code to reproduce this issue? Can it be that you have a method in your bootstrap named \_initMultiDb() ?
