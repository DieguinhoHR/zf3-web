ZF2-509: Zend\\Di\\DefinitionList with ClassDefinition collecting supertypes problem

### Description

If DefinitionList has multiple classDefinition, Zend\\Di\\DefinitionList::getClassSupertypes or Zend\\Di\\DefinitionList::getInstantiator call each classDefinition. A classDefinition instance is per-Class definition. And ClassDefinition::getClassSupertypes($class) returns simply its supertypes . In this flow, the class-name-parameter is meaningless.

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Di/Definition/ClassDefinition.php#L134)

DefinitionInterface expects getClassSupertypes to return array filtered with the classname parameter.

 
    public function getClassSupertypes($class)
    {
        if ($this->class !== $class) return array();
        return $this->supertypes;
    }

I made up pull request about this. [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2265#issuecomment-8174727) And this is reproductive codes.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php 
    
    use Zend\Di\Definition\ClassDefinition;
    use Zend\Di\DefinitionList;
    
    $definitionClassA = new ClassDefinition("A");
    $definitionClassA->setSupertypes(array("superA"));
    $definitionClassB = new ClassDefinition("B");
    $definitionClassB->setSupertypes(array("superB"));
    $definitionList = new DefinitionList(array($definitionClassA, $definitionClassB));
    
    $resultA = $definitionList->getClassSuperTypes("A");
    var_dump($resultA);
    $resultB = $definitionList->getClassSuperTypes("B");
    var_dump($resultB);


Expected:

A: array("superA") B: array("superB")

Actual: A: array(2) { [0]=> string(6) "superA" [1]=> string(6) "superB" } B: array(2) { [0]=> string(6) "superA" [1]=> string(6) "superB" }

And these cause wrong injection to new-instance. Zend\\Di\\Di::newInstance

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            foreach ($definitions->getClassSupertypes($class) as $supertype) {
                $injectionMethods[$supertype] = $definitions->getMethods($supertype);
            }
    ......snip....
            $this->handleInjectDependencies($instance, $injectionMethods, $params, $class, $alias, $name);


it collects wrong injectionMethods from wrong supertypes. and so pass to handleInjectDependencies. In Zend\\Di\\Di::handleInjectDependencies, It uses wrong injection methods and wrong parameters.

I think it should be discussed whether the ClassDefinition in its current implementation should implement DefinitionInterface. As i understand the documentation of DefinitionInterface, it describes/is a collection of class definitions, whereas ClassDefinition is a single class definition...

So, in my opinion, the above solution solves a bug that was caused by a deeper, conceptually problem.

Shouldn't Array-, Builder-, Compiler- and RuntimeDefinitions hold a map of ClassDefinition instances? More abstract: Map DefinitionInterface

pros: - operate with ClassDefinitionInterface instances within DefinitionInterfaces rather then with "plain" arrays - more intuitive API (avoid "if($this->class === $class) ..." - absurdity for a specific class definition)

cons: - BC break

I agree with you about DefinitionInterface concepts.

ArrayDefinition is "Class definitions based on a given array", so it is a Definition for multiple class. ClassDefinition's description is that "Class definitions for a single class". I feel it should be abstractive signature representing the class structure. For example, Zend\\Di\\Config::configure makes an ArrayDefinition that it has a collection of ClassDefinition instances.

On the other hand, we already have a Definition's collection ,the DefinitionList. I think the current implementation is not bad. A DefinitionInterface usually has multiple class, but specially it has only a single class. And so single is specially, it should have codes "if($this->class === $class) ..."

[~az] I think there's nothing wrong in having a ClassDefinition implement the DefinitionInterface. It is just a "map" with a single element in it. What is weird is that `$definition->getClassSupertypes($class)` seems to retrieve wrong data.

As told on the mailing list, PR #2265 seems fine to me, but should also add checks on the rest of the `ClassDefinition`

I closed the pull-requests #2265,#2277 .And I remade a commit squashed. <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2295> Please review it.

Thanks.

I'm sorry. #2295 had several problems. I made an amendment in it.
