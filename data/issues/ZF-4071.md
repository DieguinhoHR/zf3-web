ZF-4071: Lucene doesn't work on 64-bit 
---------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-26T05:54:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-03T03:19:13.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.4 (23/Jun/09)

### Description

I tried Zend\_Search\_Lucene on a 32 bit and all was fine. Trying on a 64 bit simply doesn't work. The same index correctly opened on the 32 bit machine raises an exception on 64 bit. Looking in the code I discovered that there's a problem with integer precision: on line 422 of Zend/Search/Lucene.php the code:

$numField = $segmentsFile->readInt();

gives -1 on 32 bit, 4294967295 on 64 bit, reading the same index.

moreover, on line 425 the code

if ($numField != (int)0xFFFFFFFF)

fails, since 0xFFFFFFFF has a different value on 32 bit and 64 bit. As workaround I changed numField to -1 and skipped the check and it works. So I think it's sufficent to change the test and the readInt function.

Hello guys,

I've just experienced this issue, quick-looked into the code and just made a patch for this. It's changing -1 to (int)0xFFFFFFFF in more places, like in other places it is done already.

The patch (looks like this is reverse patch, but you'll deal with it):

This is patch to hopefully fix the Lucene addDocument on 64bit systems. It seems it is a reverse patch.

Any information on this, ZF team?

This: [http://framework.zend.com/code/viewrep/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/viewrep/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Search/Lucene.php?r1=15946&r2=16167) seams to include what I suggested.

I'll test it. Thanks!

Hello guys, I need your help.

I've installed Drupal (<http://drupal.org/>), module Search Lucene API (<http://drupal.org/project/luceneapi>) with Zend Framework components (<http://drupal.org/node/521604>) and module Search Lucene DidYouMean ([http://drupal.org/project/luceneapi\_dym](http://drupal.org/project/luceneapi_dym)). First partial indexings were successful, but now "Index statistics" for Search Lucene DidYouMean is: "Number of documents in index: 13500; Number of terms: 90598", and I'm getting "Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 71 bytes) in /var/www/**_/data/www/_**/modules/luceneapi\_dym/luceneapi\_dym.index.inc on line 64" when I'm trying to perform indexing. Replacing -1 with (int)0xFFFFFFFF, as you suggested, doesn't solve a problem. Applying fixes from [http://framework.zend.com/code/viewrep/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/viewrep/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Search/Lucene.php?r1=15946&r2=16167) makes search inoperative. Replacing library folder with one, extracted from <http://framework.zend.com/download/latest>, too.

Please upload to somewhere an archive, which I should to use instead of Zend Framework components (<http://sourceforge.net/projects/luceneapi>) to get things working. Or give me to know what I need to change in code. I'll be very grateful!
