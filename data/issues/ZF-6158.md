### Description

This feature needed for iterating large result sets (with tables having thousands/millions of rows) (main use case batch task execution, data export/import, etc). Idea is to fetch data of row at Zend\_Db\_(Table\_)Rowset::next method call. Now rowset is constructed with all data fetched which results in memory limit errors.
