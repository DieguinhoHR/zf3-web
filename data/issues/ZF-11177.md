    ZF-11177: Update Zend_Gdata to use HTTPS by default for all services that fully support it.
    
    This enables HTTPS by default for the following services:
    - Zend_Gdata_Books
    - Zend_Gdata_Calendar
    - Zend_Gdata_Docs
    - Zend_Gdata_Gbase
    - Zend_Gdata_Photos
    - Zend_Gdata_Spreadsheets
    
    Notably, Zend_Gdata_YouTube is omitted due to blocking issues on YouTube's end.
