### Description

Forms with a translator do not translate element labels in the list of form errors. I believe the problem exists in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_FormErrors::renderLabel. Following a similar pattern to Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label, the following patch should provide the functionality (patch against trunk r15870):

Index: library/Zend/Form/Decorator/FormErrors.php
=================================================

--- library/Zend/Form/Decorator/FormErrors.php (revision 15870) +++ library/Zend/Form/Decorator/FormErrors.php (working copy) @@ -351,6 +351,10 @@ $label = $element->getName(); }

- if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
- $label = $translator->translate($label);
- }
- return $this->getMarkupElementLabelStart() . $view->escape($label) . $this->getMarkupElementLabelEnd();

Thanks

Sorry, patch doesn't seem to come out that well. I can provide a file if needed.

Hey Steve, There is an attach file function for issues.

Please use that to attach the patch.
