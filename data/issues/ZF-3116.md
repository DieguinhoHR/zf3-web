### Description

Using SQL Server 2000, and Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql

Here's the application code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try
    {
        //$email_requests_table is an instance of a Zend_Db_Table_Abstract extension
        $new = $email_requests_table->createRow(array(
            'oc_id' => $input['oc_id'][$i],
            'EmailAddress' => $input['EmailAddress'],
            'PersonName' => $input['PersonName'],
        ));
        $new->save();
    }
    catch(Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception $e)
    {
        header("content-type: text/plain"); die(print_r($new, true) . "\n" . print_r($e, true));
    }


Using a SQL Profiler I was able to apprehend that the correct insert is performed, but during \_refresh() the following invalid query is sent: {quote} SELECT "vp\_Email\_Requests".\* FROM "vp\_Email\_Requests" WHERE ("TblPK" = 181) SELECT \* FROM (SELECT TOP 1 \* FROM {color:red} (){color} AS inner\_tbl) AS outer\_tbl {quote} Which is sending an error back "Incorrect syntax near ')'" (highlighted in red)

I'm certain my application code is right, because I've done similar tasks using a MySQL adapter. I'm thinking this is a Mssql adapter related bug.

This is what $email\_requests\_table is an instance of

It looks like this bug may be coming from line 1044 of Zend/Db/Select.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_adapter->limit('', $count, $offset)


It's calling the limit function, but passing an empty $sql variable, so the result is that the subselect is empty.
