ZF-8716: dojo DateTextBox 'yy' format bug
-----------------------------------------

### Description

When using setDatePattern on a Dojo DateTextBox form element yy pattern behaves the same as yyyy even though Unicode Date Format Pattern specifies that yy should produce a year pattern with a maximum of length 2.

Example: setDatePattern('dd-MMM-yy')

behaves like

setDatePattern('dd-MMM-yyyy')

Just for information: Unicode says that 'yy' means minimum 2 lettered year of date... this means 3, 4 or 5 letters are also acceptable (even if this does not conform how expected output is)

Looks like this is by design in dojo: [http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/â€¦](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/form/DateTextBox.html#working-with-two-digit-years) and actually this isn't a bug but a feature.

Thoughts?

Agree with Robert Basic:

bq. widget.constraints.fullYear = false; widget.attr('value', widget.attr('value'));

This will reload the Year to short form, but is only avaibale after the widget has been created. A feature could be added so that the onLoad parser, changes the year to shortform 'yy'

e.g. bq. $element = new Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_DateTextBox('datebox'); bq. $element->setTwoDigitsYear(true);
