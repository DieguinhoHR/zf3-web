### Description

Working around bug <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5200>, I wanted to leave the named parameter in for documentation purposes.

This causes the following error :

Message: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: number of bound variables does not match number of tokens

Comments should be stripped before anything else is done with the query. I know this is already done by each dbms but it's probably simpler than catching every case where syntax might conflict. Another example of this <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4312>

To recreate :

$query = "INSERT INTO Chomsky VALUES (:id, /_:dateCreated_/ NOW(), :dateExpanded, :creatorId;";

 
                            $params = array(
                                ":id"                   => null,
                                //":dateCreated"            => new Zend_Db_Expr('NOW()'),  // Zend bug #5200
                                ":dateExpanded"         => null,
                                ":creatorId"            => 0
                            );
    
                            $result = $db->query($query, $params);


 

 

### Comments

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2010-11-20T21:32:07.000+0000

Zend\_Db does not attempt to address "comments" within queries.

Closing as not an issue. If this is a well-known use case, lets address this in Zend Db 2.0.
