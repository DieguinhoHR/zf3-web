### Description

MariaDB is a fork of mysql and intends to be (and is) a community branch rather than fork. It also simply is a drop-in replacement of mysql, so in ZF there shouldn't be any coding issues, making this issue probably a documentation issue.

The point is, ZF should support mariadb, and mention it ;)
