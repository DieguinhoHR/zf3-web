### Description

There is a small Bug (Problem) in the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Form. With the current Helper it isnt possible to get the opening form tag only, like in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form. So there is a difference in behavior. You are always getting opening and closing form-tag, even if you dont pass a $content to the function.

The Problem is line 73 to 75, where the $content var is set to '' if it is false. (these lines should be deleted)

It should be directly given to the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form instead. (same behavior)
