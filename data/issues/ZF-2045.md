ZF-2045: Add memoization to Zend\_Cache\_Core::load()

### Description

Use case :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $id = 'foo';
    $res = $cache->get( $id ); // loads it a first time
    [...] // lot of code
    $res = $cache->get( $id ); // loads it a second time


Actually, in this situation, the backend is call two time. A quick implementation of memoization in Zend\_Cache\_Core::load() can solve it.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    private $loaded_entries;
    
    public function __construct($options = array())
    {
            [...]
            $this->loaded_entries = array();
    }
    
    public function load($id, $doNotTestCacheValidity = false, $doNotUnserialize = false)
        {
            if (!$this->_options['caching']) {
                return false;
            }
            
            if(isset($this->loaded_entries[$id])) 
                return $this->loaded_entries[$id];
            
            $this->_lastId = $id;
            self::_validateIdOrTag($id);
            $data = $this->_backend->load($id, $doNotTestCacheValidity);
            if ($data===false) {
                // no cache available
                return false;
            }
            if ((!$doNotUnserialize) && $this->_options['automatic_serialization']) {
                // we need to unserialize before sending the result
                $data = unserialize($data);
            }
            
            $this->loaded_entries[$id] = $data;
            
            return $data;
        }

A BIG NO-NO!! This would duplicate data in memory for each cache-ID's data. If you have to load cache for more than once during a request, why not just store it in our own var for later use? A static var or the Registry, maybe? This is functionality of memorizing data is too specific of a use-case and not recommended at the component level but should be handled/managed by the developer himself. Loading cache data for more than once (even memorizing data) during a request indicates a design flaw.

Please do not complicate the component. If memorizing of loaded data is requested by a majority of users, it may be offered as an _option_ initialized/defaulted to FALSE.

I agree with you. I maintain this issue open to get feedbacks.
