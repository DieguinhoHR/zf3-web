### Description

The form validators allow the usage of breakchainonfailure. Actually this parameter is ignored by Zend\_File\_Transfer.

It should be added for consistency.

The new feature "breakChainOnFailure" has been added with r11430.

The syntax for form validation and file validation is now consistent. But as this is a small BC break it could be possible that you have to adopt your scripts validator creation calls.
