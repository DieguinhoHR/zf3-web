### Description

Morph Zend\_Config::\_isValidKeyName() into Zend\_Config::\_formatKey() where \_formatKey() works very similar to Zend\_Dispatcher::\_formatName().

Not going to fix this as it breaks predictability.

At the moment, you get an exception if a key is invalid which tells you what happened. If we automatically morphed it into it into a valid key, it would require the user to work out that the key name has been changed by the class and no notification has been given.
