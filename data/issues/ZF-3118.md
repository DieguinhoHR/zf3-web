ZF-3118: Validation problem with array elements
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2008-04-16T04:46:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-05-05T11:44:48.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.2 (15/May/08)

### Description

There seems to be a mistake on the isValid method of the Zend\_Form\_Element class. The validation is performed twice for array's elements. Each items of the array are validated, then the array is validated too.

Suggested fix : Prepend the "else" keyword on the line 1203 on revision 9215 :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    Then the problem will be solved with the classical test :


public function isValid($value, $context = null) { ... foreach ($this->getValidators() as $key => $validator) { ... if ($isArray && is\_array($value)) ... else if ($validator->isValid($value, $context)) ... else ... ... } ... } ```

Greetings.
