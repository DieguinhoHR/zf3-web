ZF-7958: Error log pollution while loading a class

### Description

Zend\_Loader uses a method (LoadFile) to load a file. If $dirs is an array, the function adds all dirs in $dir to the path and then try to load the file. include tries to get the file from all the dirs in include\_path and log a warning for each dir where the file cannot be found.

Using a file\_exists for each dir to find the file, then including the file with his full path would be better. On a "big" application, a page can load many files and generate a lot of lines into the log file (or into firebug in my case) for nothing.
