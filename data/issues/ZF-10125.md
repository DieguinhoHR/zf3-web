### Description

I spent quite a bit of time figuring out that to actually use the error handler plugin of ZF one should have throwExceptions=false in the FC.

While this might be obvious for someone working with the system for a long time I find the doc concerning errorHandler plugin bit lacking there. In my mind there should be simple note for this throwExceptions thingy. Simply put one should know exactly what is needed to make use of the plugin.

All the best..Keep up the great work.
