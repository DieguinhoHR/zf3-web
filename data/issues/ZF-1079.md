### Description

This example for roman numbers do not function:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Measure/Number.php';
    
    $great = '_X';
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('en');
    $unit = new Zend_Measure($great,Zend_Measure_Number::ROMAN, $locale);
    
    // convert to the decimal system
    echo $unit->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Number::DECIMAL);
    ?>

After resolution of ZF-1078, it must be converted to:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Measure/Number.php';
    
    $great = 'X';
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('en');
    $unit = new Zend_Measure_Number($great,Zend_Measure_Number::ROMAN, $locale);
    
    // convert to the decimal system
    echo $unit->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Number::DECIMAL);
    ?>

Fixed with SVN 4120.

But \_X is not X... \_X = 10000 X only 10
