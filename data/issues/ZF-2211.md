### Description

Hi,

I'd like to use the "BETWEEN" operator in my select statement. (ex : SELECT \* FROM product WHERE price BETWEEN x AND y) Currently i don't see how i can do this. So I write my own function, I give it to you the code, but i think there is a better way to do the same thing cause in fact i just want to quote 2 values separatly. It should be better if the where function do something like that.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
        * $select->between('price BETWEEN ? ', 100, 200);
        */
    
        public function between($cond)
        {
            if (func_num_args() > 1) {
                $min  = $this->_adapter->quote(func_get_arg(1));
                $max  = $this->_adapter->quote(func_get_arg(2));
                $cond = str_replace('?', $min . ' AND ' . $max, $cond);
            }
    
            if ($this->_parts[self::WHERE]) {
                $this->_parts[self::WHERE][] = "AND ($cond)";
            } else {
                $this->_parts[self::WHERE][] = "($cond)";
            }
    
            return $this;
        }

Well...

The actual way would be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->where('price > ?', 100)->where('price < ?', 200);


I think "Between" is not supported by all adapters.

Unassigned as original additional where methodology was not accepted.

Class will be reworked by Simon... sorry if I confused anybody. He has a better overview over the complete Db design, not only Zend\_Db\_Select and will help better than me.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Will be evaluted with linked issue, I am not sure between is the correct addition where WHERE would be more intuitive

The BETWEEN operator is part of SQL-92 and AFAIK is well supported by the RDBMSes Zend\_Db abstracts. I would favor implementation of ZF-2142 (Allow the where() method of Zend\_Db\_Select to accept multiple arguments for automatic quoting) instead of the OP's suggestion:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->where('price BETWEEN ? AND ?', 100, 200);


Closing as Won't Fix.
