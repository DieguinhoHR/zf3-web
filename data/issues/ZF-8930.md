Sorry for my english. I don't understand what are you asking for. If you want i could send you my code with a script for my database. In the model, i get the rowSet that is associated with my user actually logged in, the first time i ask for the rowSet the member of my model that stores the rowSet is NULL, the i initialize it with the rowSet from my database, the subsequent access to my rowSet are satisfied with the rowSet stored in my model. the first access is when he asked for the form to choose a subset of then (if any), if there are none then a page with a message appears. Else a page with the rowSet data is show to the user, in this request is also accesed the rowSet to format the form with it's data. Then when the user submit the form i modify the rowSet with his selection and then i reactivate the rowSet setting the table before i could iterate over the rowSet to save each row.

I am looking for something like this: [http://ralphschindler.com/2010/02/…](http://ralphschindler.com/2010/02/18/the-anatomy-of-a-bug-issue-reproduction-script)

Please try to isolate the issue to just Zend\_Db (that means reproduce it without any other components involved, like Zend\_Session or your models, etc)
