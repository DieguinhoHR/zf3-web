### Description

When adding adding an instance of Zend\_Filter\_LocalizedToNormalized to a Zend\_Form\_Element and a date is given, Zend\_Filter\_LocalizedToNormalized returns an array rather than a string/bool/float/int. This value is then parsed through Zend\_View\_Abstract::escape(), which cannot work with arrays and therefore a php warning is given. I propose to either not escape values that are an array, or either parse the values individually.

The given php error (which is a warning in fact) is: {quote}Warning: htmlspecialchars() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in ~/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 849{quote}

This problem occurs also when using custom filters which return an array, or when using the Callback filter for example with explode().

Closing as won't fix.

Reason: Zend\_Filter\_Localized will be completly reworked for ZF 2.0. Dates and numbers should not be processed by the same filter. I am working on a own date filter which allows this handling and will no longer return array.

Agreed. Tnx.
