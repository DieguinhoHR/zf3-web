ZF-10638: Zend Db Select Returns False Booleans As Empty Strings
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-03T12:08:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-10T20:34:02.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend Db Select is returning false booleans as empty strings whilst true booleans return as the string: '1'. This inconsistency makes programmatic handling of boolean values difficult.

Ideally it'd return SQL boolean values as PHP booleans which are null, true, or false.

This feature request has been asked for in ZF-300, ZF-1457, and ZF-538 in some way or another.

This will be addressed in Zend\\Db for ZF 2.0
