ZF-701: When encoding a float the "."-character should always be used as decimalpoint.

### Description

The decimalpoint should always be a "."-character when encoding a float because if I use floats in an array it could become {"float":5,6,"float2":56,66} which is not good.

I think the reason that I see this is because I use swedish locale and in Sweden we use the ","-character as decimalpoint.

The easiest solution I found was to change row 213 in Encoder.php from: $result = (string)$value; to $result = (string)str\_replace(',', '.', $value);

Not sure if that is the way to do it but it works for me.

The notation you provide is invalid javascript anyways, due to the extra commas used in a list context -- I have yet to find a js implementation that can parse it.

BTW, ext/json will actually decode this to NULL as it is unable to parse it.
