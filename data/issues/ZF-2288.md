### Description

Let's suppose we use this URL /module/controller/action/param1/1/param2/2

If I call $this->\_getAllParams() in my controller I get an array off five parameters. Now imagine I only want user parameters (ie param1 and param2) but I can't predict their name. I must call \_getAllParams() and unset the keys corresponding to the module, controller and action. I must add logic in my application that is dependant of the internal logic of the zend MVC. Yes I could do an controller helper but I'm not sure this is the right way as the functionnality could be need by other peoples.

It would be great if we could just call an \_getAllUserParams() that will return all params except module+controller+action.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This would require significant changes to the request object, and would actually introduce some substantial BC breaks. Will not add.
