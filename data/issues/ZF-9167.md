### Description

Right now the common variant to include jQuery UI CSS is to add: $view->JQuery()->addStylesheet('/path/to/the.css');

When jQuery is enabled - it will be rendered (outputed inside head tag). But as I want to add UI CSS style, it would be better to include it ONLY when UI is enbled.

So I propose to add addUIStylesheet($path) method to add stylesheets which will be outputed only when UI will be enabled.
