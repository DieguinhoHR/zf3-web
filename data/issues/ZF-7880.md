### Description

Due to the performance impact, there should be an change/option under MySQL to use MyISAM tables.

In enterprise environments that process thousands of messages at a time, INNODB creates issues in processing overhead as well as backup and consistency issues.

Alternatives can be: stored procedures or adding additional delete statements instead of the foreign key.

I am guessing that there is more MySQL usage with Zend\_Framework, than other DB's, so this may be welcome for larger sites with lots of data.

You can create whatever table structure or table type you'd like by extending the Zend\_Queue classes. Converting the tables to be MyISAM instead of InnoDB should have no impact on the usage of Zend\_Queue (I would actually tend to think performance would be worse with MyISAM). We made some performance improvements in SVN commit # 18420 which should make it into the next minor release, please see if that helps your issue.
