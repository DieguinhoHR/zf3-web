### Description

Hello. My name is Rinat, I want to contribute ZF by my class.

PHP5 UTF-8 is a UTF-8 aware library of functions mirroring PHP's own string functions <http://code.google.com/p/php5-utf8/source/browse/> This package is advance of <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phputf8> (last updated in 2007).

_Features and benefits of using this class_ \* Compatibility with the interface standard PHP functions that deal with single-byte encodings \* Ability to work without PHP extensions ICONV and MBSTRING, if any, that are actively used! Uses the fastest available method between MBSTRING, ICONV, native on PHP and hacks. \* Useful features are missing from the ICONV and MBSTRING \* The methods that take and return a string, are able to take and return null. This useful for selects from a database. \* Several methods are able to process arrays recursively \* Validating method parameters to allowed types via reflection (You can disable it) \* A single interface and encapsulation, You can inherit and override \* Test coverage \* PHP> = 5.3.x

Example: $s = 'Hello, Привет'; if (UTF8::is\_utf8($s)) echo UTF8::strlen($s);

Rinat,

ZFv1 is no longer accepting new features, and also the minimum PHP version is 5.2.4 yet your class requires 5.3.x.

If this is still something you wish to contribute to ZF, I would suggest opening an RFC on the [Zend Framework 2 wiki page](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC%27s) to begin the process of having it accepted into ZF2
