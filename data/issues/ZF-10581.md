### Description

Hello, I'm using zend\_db\_table (but also tried with prepare/execute statements) to store date into an MSSQL database, the problem is that the data in the query should have the N' prefix (<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/239530>) but there's no way to generate a query like that.

The result is that the data is stored and can be read by PHP but using the MSSQL console the data is broken.
