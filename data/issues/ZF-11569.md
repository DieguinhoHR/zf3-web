ZF-11569: Zend\_Text\_Figlet silently aborts execution when iconv is not installed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Text\_Figlet::render() calls iconv\_strlen prefixed with the @ error suppression operator.

If iconv is not installed, this causes the script to abort without displaying any error message.

As Zend\_Text\_Figlet is used during the Getting Started tutorial, recommend that it include an explicit check for iconv, or better yet, avoids the use of @

I've patched my own installation of Zend Framework to include the following inside the render method

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!extension_loaded('iconv')) {
        throw new Zend_Text_Figlet_Exception('Zend_text_Figlet requires iconv extension to be present');
    }

The iconv extension is enabled by defaul (see [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/iconv.installation.php)). Thus it is used in the entire Framework without explicitly checking for it.
