### Description

Product: Zend Framework 1.10.x Web Server: Apache 2.2.16 / PHP 5.3.x OS Name: Linux CentOS 5.x (Other) CPU info is Intel Core i7 - 3.40 GHz

Hi,

We operate a popular website of classied ads using Zend Framework. Unfortunately we encounter major issues with this website. There are multiple MySQL queries that aren't closing and in sleep for over 2-3 minutes. This results in the load of the server going up until the server cannot handle it and crashes.

We have tried everything we can to make sure the connections do not stay open but so far nothing seems to work.

We have been struggling for weeks with this issue and we would very much appreciate any help you can provide us with.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Rodolphe

This is a support question, not a specific bug report.
