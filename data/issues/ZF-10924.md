ZF-10924: Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_\_call assumes formatActionName() result
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The \_\_call method, trying to describe an occured error, uses a hard-coded, own implementation

Zend/Controller/Action.php, line 483 [code] if ('Action' == substr($methodName, -6)) { [/code]

to detect if the user tried to call an (non existing) action or method. If a user does not rely on Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract's formatActionName() but uses his onw dispatcher, the exception thrown is misleading, as indicating call to an action where a method was called and vice-versa.

As far as i know this problem is identified in the ZF2 MVC interface proposals and planned to redesign in ZF2's MVC implementation.

[Find more information here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Proposal+for+MVC+Interfaces#ProposalforMVCInterfaces-Dispatching).

Richard is correct -- fixes for this are planned for ZF2. For now, you will need to override the \_\_call() method in your controllers (or a base controller you define) in order to alter the behavior.
