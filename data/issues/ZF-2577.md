ZF-2577: \_dependentTables and \_referenceMap should have class parameter

### Description

I tried to follow Coding Standard and Naming Conventions with my database models. But it all breaks when I try $paper->findPaperWriter() or $paperWriter->findParentPaper().

CREATE TABLE paper ... CREATE TABLE paper\_writer ( paper\_id... );

So I'd like to have

Database/Paper.php Database/Paper/Writer.php

class Database\_Paper class Database\_Paper\_Writer

All of this would work, if I would call $paper->findDatabasePaperWriter() or $paperWriter->findParentDatabasePaperWriter(), but as you can see this is not a very good solution. I found two solutions.

1. "class" parameter in \_dependentTables and \_referenceMap, that would tell ZF to look for certain class instead of trying magically resolve it. Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstarct.php findDependentRowset() and findParentRow() should check for if there parameter has been set and use that instead of the one received as $dependentTable or $parentTable parameter.
2. have addHelperPath() similar to Zend\_View View Helper

Quick test with Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php findDependentRowset() seems to work just fine!

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $dependapleTables = $this->_getTable()->getDependentTables();
            if (is_array($dependapleTables[$dependentTable])) {
                Zend_Loader::loadClass($dependapleTables[$dependentTable]['class']);
    
                $dependentTable = new $dependapleTables[$dependentTable]['class'](array('db' => $db));
            } elseif (is_string($dependentTable)) {

Apparently I don't know how to use comment markup on here, sorry about that.

After using my fix for a while I noticed some problems with Parent magic methods. I noticed, that there's a lot of code that would require if clauses. So instead of option 1. I presented earlier I'm now leaning towards option 2. of using addDatabasePath(). Option 2 would also be backwards compatible and would ease working.

After some copy paste from Zend\_View I have a working Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract, that utilizes addDatabasePath() concept and this time it even seems to work without a problem.

I'll generate a patch of it tomorrow after cleanup.

This patch modifies Db/Table/Abstract.php and Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php adding the possibility to have prefixes for database files. I have database tables on each file so hierarchially so, that it's 1:1 to the datbase.

Example of Customer table: In bootstrap Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::addRelationshipPath('../library/Site/Db/Table', 'Site\_Db\_Table');

../library/Site/Db/Table/Customer.php class Site\_Db\_Table\_Customer{}

This is a proper patch. The previous contained hardcoding from my codebase.

Perhaps the first str\_replace('' could be replaced with some ZF core function?

The \_addPath had a minor defunc, when it didn't check if the path already exists.

Fixed function

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        private function _addPath($path, $prefix = null)
        {
            foreach ((array) $path as $dir) {
                // attempt to strip any possible separator and
                // append the system directory separator
                $dir = str_replace(array('/', '\\'), DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $dir);
                $dir = rtrim($dir, DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR)
                     . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR;
                $params = array('prefix' => $prefix, 'dir' => $dir);
    
                if (!in_array($params, self::$_path)){
                    // add as array with prefix and dir keys
                    array_unshift(self::$_path, $params);
                }
            }
        }

I think this is change is required to maintain compability with those who wont be using RelationshipPath. The main point is the code inside else.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _prepareReference(Zend_Db_Table_Abstract $dependentTable, Zend_Db_Table_Abstract $parentTable, $ruleKey)
        {
            if (count($parentTable->getRelationshipPath() > 0) {
                foreach ($parentTable->getRelationshipPath() as $relationshipPath) {
                    $parentTable = str_replace('_', '', str_replace($relationshipPath, '', get_class($parentTable)));
                }
            } else {
                $parentTable = get_class($parentTable);
            }

Please categorize/fix as needed.

 

 

Posted by Teemu Välimäki (cred) on 2008-03-27T11:31:55.000+0000

This latest patch contains all the fixes applied against trunk.

 

 

Posted by Teemu Välimäki (cred) on 2008-03-27T11:55:28.000+0000

And of course I managed to screw newest patch up a bit. Table/Row/Abstract.php line 776 is missing closing )

Otherwise it's good to go

My patches remove @ in front of Zend\_Loader and thus, should to some extent solve the issue.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Will evaluate within 2 weeks

Marking this as 'wont fix'. There are a couple of new components in place that would better facilitate what you are asking for. First is the module autoloader in Zend\_Application. You can read about the Zend\_Application\_Module\_Autoloader here [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table) and here <http://devzone.zend.com/article/4525>

As for the magic finder \_\_call() method, I would tend to stay away from it: findParentClassNameByRule() in favor of the actual calls themselves: findParentRow($class ...) and findDependentRowset($class, ...)

Have a look at the new Zend\_Application functionailty, i think it solves what you are looking for.
