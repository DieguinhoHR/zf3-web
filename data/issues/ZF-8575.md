### Description

I noticed that, by default, a Zend\_Form\_Element of array-type (Zend\_Form\_Element::$\_isArray set to true) has the value null, shouldn't be an empty array?

For instance, the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect's goal is to hold zero, one or more values. When none is stored, my opinion is that Zend\_Form\_Element::getValue() should return array().

I ran into that "bug" when validating a $\_POST array against a Zend\_Form containing a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect. I noticed that, if that multiselect hadn't been filled on submission, it's value were set to null, instead of the expected empty array.

If it is really a bug, I don't know where would be the better place to fix it. Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi ?

Depending on where the solution would be done, I want to note that Zend\_Form::isValid() passes null to the Form\_Element, without checking if it's an array-type element or note.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
                $element->setTranslator($translator);
                if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                    $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
                } else {
                    $valid = $element->isValid($data[$key], $data) && $valid;
                }
            }

Zend\_Form::isValid() passes null if there is no data for the Element with specified name which is the key in the array getElements().

And Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi\* isValid() does not require the value to be an array.

Still a bug in Zend Framework 1.10.6
