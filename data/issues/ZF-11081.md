ZF-11081: Wrong item numbering with Zend\_Paginator over Zend\_Mail

### Description

Hi!

I'm trying to use pagination in my email listing. There are 52 items in my mailbox. On the first page it numbers from 1 to 10, but on the second page the listing starts with 10 again and goes up to 19. 20 to 29 on the following page and so on. Everything is fine without pagination. The items are correctly displayed with the numbers 1 to 52.

This is the code I'm using:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap(array('host'     => 'host',
                                             'user'     => 'user',
                                             'password' => 'pass',
                         'ssl' => 'TLS'));
    
    $this->view->number_messages = count($mail);
        
    $paginator = new Zend_Paginator(new Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Iterator($mail));
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber((int) $this->getRequest()->getParam('page'));
    $this->view->mail = $paginator;


 
    <pre class="highlight">


    <?php foreach ($this->mail as $messageNum => $message): ?> 

`<?=$messageNum?>: <?=$message->subject ?>`

    <?php endforeach; ?>



    
    <?php echo $this->paginationControl($this->mail, 'Sliding', 'my_pagination_control.phtml'); ?>

Components changed. It relates to Zend\_Paginator and not Zend\_Navigation.

Not fixed in trunk. Maybe it's a workaround but this does the job:

Index: Mail/Storage/Abstract.php
================================

--- Mail/Storage/Abstract.php (Revision 24182) +++ Mail/Storage/Abstract.php (Arbeitskopie) @@ -360,7 +360,7 @@ if ($pos > $this->\_iterationMax) { throw new OutOfBoundsException('this position does not exist'); } - $this->\_iterationPos = $pos; + $this->\_iterationPos = $pos + 1; }

}

If I use the iterator with foreach, Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Abstract->valid() is called twice for the first page. I can't say if this is normal behaviour.

My last comment fixed the problem for me. I can't see any problems with that. Someone should review this.
