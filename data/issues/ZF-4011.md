### Description

In some places in the manual where Zend\_Filter\_Inflector is explained. There are pieces of example code tha tlook like this.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.layout.advanced.html#zend.layout.advanced.inflector)

$inflector->setRules(array( ':script' => array('CamelCaseToUnderscore'), 'suffix' => 'phtml' ));

This however triggers an error :

Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception: Plugin by name CamelCaseToUnderscore was not found in the registry. in Zend\\Loader\\PluginLoader.php on line 370

Because the Filter 'CamelCaseToUnderscore is not present in the root of the Filter directory. It's inside a sub folder 'Word'. Prefixing CamelCaseToUnderscore with Word\_ fixes this.

Ralph, is this the correct fix? If so, I will fix it in the ref guide.
