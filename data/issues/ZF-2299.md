ZF-2299: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract should support "prepend"

### Description

With the current unreleased Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract, it is possible to set and append data, but not prepend. I first realized this problem when I wanted to prepend a string with the HeadTitle view helper.

This method would do the trick, but I'm sure something more space-efficient could be done:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function prepend($value) {
        $values = $this->getArrayCopy();
    
        array_unshift($values, $value);
    
        $this->exchangeArray($values);
    }

Just noticed that this was added to SVN, but I didn't see a new PREPEND class constant to go along with SET and APPEND. Also, certain placeholder sub-classes (HeadTitle) should support this option.

PREPEND constant added, and support for PREPEND in capturing provided. HeadTitle() and other helpers will be utilizing these containers, so the last comment is basically a non-issue.

In Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle::headTitle() in the incubator, on lines 69-73, the view helper restricts support to SET and APPEND. I don't see how it's a "non issue", unless when you said, "will be utilizing...", you were speaking of future changes that remove this restriction.

The HeadTitle helper in the incubator is under active development; please wait to re-open the issue until an announcement has been made on-list regarding its completion. (I'm currently refactoring it yet again as I write this.)

incubator == active development. Please post potential issues on the relevant list prior to posting issues on incubator components, as the API may change at any time.

I wasn't really sure where to post problems about incubator code, but now I know. Sorry for being a pill. :)
