### Description

The fetchRow function discards the offset, such that

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $teams->select()
      ->where('colour = ?', 'orange')
      ->order('result')
      ->limit(1,10);
              
    echo (string) $teams;
    // SELECT `teams`.* FROM `teams` WHERE (colour = 'orange') ORDER BY `result` ASC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10
            
    $teams->fetchRow($teams);
    // SELECT `teams`.* FROM `teams` WHERE (colour = 'orange') ORDER BY `result` ASC LIMIT 1


This is an old issue that has been marked resolved but it wasn't and has been ignored despite attempts to reawaken both old tickets.

patch from 1.10.8, but fix is still applicable:

I don't see the problem here. You have specified the count and offset in limit(1,10), so why not use $table->fetchAll($select) then? In my opinion, the key use case here is do we have to assemble the select object or could we quick fetch a row like this ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $table->fetchRow(array('colour = ?' => 'orange'), null, 10);


Of course to get this work, we have to add an $offset parameter into the fetchRow method ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function fetchRow($where = null, $order = null, $offset = null)

Patch attached to support my suggested use case and fix the inconsistency pointed out here.
