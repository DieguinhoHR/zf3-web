### Description

Line 232 : $fp = @fopen($file, "wb"); And then : if ($fp) { ...

This behaviour is very annoying when using set\_error\_handler();

PHP Manual : "It is important to remember that the standard PHP error handler is completely bypassed. error\_reporting() settings will have no effect and your error handler will be called regardless - however you are still able to read the current value of error\_reporting and act appropriately. Of particular note is that this value will be 0 if the statement that caused the error was prepended by the @ error-control operator."

And i saw many other @ in the code...
