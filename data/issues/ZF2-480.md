### Description

I'm using the built-in PHP development web server during development, which makes things very convenient for me (I anticipate more and more people will do this over time).

I've found out that in this environment, $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_FILENAME'] is not set. This makes the detectBaseUrl() method of Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Request issue the following E\_WARNING:

{ Warning: strpos(): Empty delimiter in /Users/shahar/Code/Shoppimon/shoppimon-frontend/vendor/zendframework/library/Zend/Http/PhpEnvironment/Request.php on line 479 }

In this setup there is usually no base URL (the base URL is just '/') because the built-in server can be pointed directly to ZF's index.php and thus there is no need to use a sub-directory in the app's URL.

I have solved this by checking if $basename is not empty (line 479) and if it is fall back to set $baseUrl = '/';

Merged, and added a test to the patch to verify.
