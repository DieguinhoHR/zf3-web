ZF-7999: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract->find() bug!!
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-01T14:56:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-16T22:51:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using find() method with integer as the first argument, notice is created, and no valid response is returned.

My class that extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract look's something like this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Admin_DbTable_Receiver extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        public $_name = 'Receiver';
        public $_primary = 'id';
        public $_cols = array("id','manufacturer','model');
    }


// Later when i tried to use the find() method that was inherited from \*\_table\_Abstract, in the following way (example)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $receiverModel->find(2);


following notice was printed :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: Undefined index: id in /usr/share/php/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php on line 1269


and return value was null, even though the row with that id existed in the MySQL table.

Is that double quote in your example for cols a misprint or is it actually in the code?

It is a misprint. The actual class doesnt look like one provided here.

What are you trying to accomplish by populating \_cols?

The \_cols property is for the names that are returned after the metadata has been setup. If you populate \_cols, then you need to explicitly call \_setupMetadata() as it will not be run when \_getCols() is called in the various internal methods of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract.

Closing as not an issue, this is a mis-use of the \_cols. For performance tuning this class, please see the metadata cache section of the manual.
