ZF-7391: Subdirectories incorrectly handled in HTTP request object
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Lets say I have an app running a subdirectory "ABC". I have set the base url in the application.ini file as I am using the built in application/bootstrapping mechanism. Attempts to access a url such as "http://localhost/ABC/controller/action" fail because the "setPathInfo" method on the HTTP Request object is setting the "pathInfo" to "C/controller/action". The "C" is then interpreted as the module.

I traced the problem down to ~ line 605 of "Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php".

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((null !== $baseUrl)
                    && (false === ($pathInfo = substr($requestUri, strlen($baseUrl)))))


...apparently should be...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((null !== $baseUrl)
                    && (false === ($pathInfo = substr($requestUri, strlen($baseUrl)+1))))


I'm running PHP 5.2.6 on Ubuntu in case there is some difference in how substr operates across versions.

With a new project, I moved .htaccess and index.php down into a directory called ABC. With, or without the application.ini setting, it works fine for me.

For application.ini, i added "resources.frontController.baseUrl = '/ABC'" to test.

If you still have an issue, please add more notes to reproduce and reopen.

Thanks, Ralph
