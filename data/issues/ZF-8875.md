ZF-8875: Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size error message does not display file size if usebytestring = false
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

As in the summary. If 'bytestring' => false is given as an option, the templated error message does not display the uploaded file's original size. e.g.:

Maximum allowed size for file 'libcurl-4.dll' is '1024' but '' detected

A quick glance suggests Zend\_Validate\_File\_FilesSize may have the same error, but I haven't tested it.

This small patch seems to fix the issue. Again, I haven't tested the FilesSize part.
