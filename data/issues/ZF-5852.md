### Description

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream throws Zend\_Log\_Exception (in several places) without calling require\_once('Zend/Log/Exception.php') first.

This ends up in a fatal error being thrown instead of the proper exception:

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Log\_Exception' not found in /home/shahar.e/Zend/workspaces/DefaultWorkspace/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Log/Writer/Stream.php on line 66

BTW this is noticable when running the Zend\_Log\_Writer\_StreamTest tests, but not when running running the entire Zend\_Log\_AllTests

also, the same is true for Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db

Fixed in rev 14131.

Same problem exists in Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority and Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Message. I won't open a new bug - I'll soon commit a fix for those two as well.

BTW it's worth to find out if there's a way to fix the unit tests so that they "forget" loaded exception classes. If that was possible, these issues were easily detected in unit tests.
