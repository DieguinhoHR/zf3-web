### Description

I changed my doctype to HTML5 and found a few errors with the w3c validation service.

It seemed that most of the errors are because the tag didn't get closed properly.

I am using follwoing php code in my boostrap file:

. . . $view->headLink()->appendStylesheet($view->baseUrl() . '/css/form.css'); . . .

The in my layout.phtml I have this line:

. . . <?php echo $this->headLink(); ?> . . .

Which produces this html code:

As you can see, the tag is not closed. Is there a way this can be implemented?

kind regards Joachim Kaufmann

View helper is consistent with HTML(5) specification.
