ZF-4622: Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_addPath() strips double-slash from protocol

### Description

This code is run on the path in Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_addPath(): $dir = rtrim($dir, DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR) . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR;

This should be removed/improved because it prevents you from using custom stream wrappers. For example, I have implemented a few custom wrappers to work with a different template engine. Instead of hacking everything to work from non-filesystem sources, I just created some stream wrappers to do it behind the scenes. I register the protocol 'tpl', and then set the script path to 'tpl://' (i.e., to load a '<a>tpl://emaple.html</a>' template). But the code above strips off the extra slash so ZF tries to load '<a>tpl:/example.html</a>' which is incorrect.

Furthermore, the \_addPath method is private so I can't override it in a subclass.

For now what I've been doing to work around the problem is to set the script path to '<a>tpl://null/</a>' to stop the rtrim from stripping the double slash from the protocol part.

Is this still an issue?

No. The unit test for ZF-9000 shows that this issue no longer exists:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @group ZF-9000
     */
    public function testAddingStreamSchemeAsScriptPathShouldNotReverseSlashesOnWindows()
    {
        if (false === strstr(strtolower(PHP_OS), 'windows')) {
            $this->markTestSkipped('Windows-only test');
        }
        $view = new Zend_View();
        $path = rtrim('file://' . str_replace('\\', '/', realpath(dirname(__FILE__))), '/') . '/';
        $view->addScriptPath($path);
        $paths = $view->getScriptPaths();
        $this->assertContains($path, $paths, var_export($paths, 1));
    }


It successfully adds a view path using the file:// scheme. This unit test should be generalized for all platforms.

Added adapted unit test to trunk r24076 \* Renamed test to: testAddingStreamSchemeAsScriptPathShouldNotMangleThePath \* Removed Windows-only constraint
