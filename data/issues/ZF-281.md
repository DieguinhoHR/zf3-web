### Description

add more predefined field, like %date%, %time%, %datec% for formatting

Zend\_Log::registerLogger(new Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_File('log/mylogfile.txt')); Zend\_Log::setAdapterOption("format","%date% (%level%) %message%");

So I don't have to add 'date' each time I call log Zend\_Log::log("Param: $noid $what" , Zend\_Log::LEVEL\_DEBUG, array("date"=>date("c")) );

Thanks

Solution exists in revision 4412.

You can add custom information items that will be interpolated into the log string. See the documentation.
