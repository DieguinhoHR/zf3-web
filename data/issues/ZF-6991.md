### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Reminder::\_\_toString() has multiple issues:

1. Using local variable instead of $this->, thus never yielding the desired output.
2. Not having spaces around the strings, thus if it would yield output, it wouldn't be properly readable.
3. $s; is not declared - first line should be (something along the lines of...) $s = '';
4. Not 100% sure on this one - but as far as I understand this class and associated GData API, it can have either an absolute time, or a set of Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds set. Therefor, it should not use elseif-statements, since a reminder can be in 3 hours AND 12 minutes.

In short... it's not very pretty - and makes me wonder if anyone actually ever \_\_toString'd this class.

\_\_toString() method fixed. According to Gdata docs you have to choose between absolute time, days, minutes or hours so I left the switch statement.

Thanks for the fix, Michael. Looks good.

I'm reopening this, because this point still needs to be addressed:

bq. 4. Not 100% sure on this one - but as far as I understand this class and associated GData API, it can have either an absolute time, or a set of Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds set. Therefor, it should not use elseif-statements, since a reminder can be in 3 hours AND 12 minutes.

That should be simple, I'll go ahead and fix that.

I looked into the GData API and found that Michael is right. The GData API only handles values consisting of one type, and suggests converting them to the smallest type required - so 2 days, 17 hours should be converted into (2x24 + 17) hours.

However, when displaying (which I presume what the \_\_toString() is intended for?), it would definitely be nicer to have the conversion into separate units so fixing it does seem to be the way to go.

As a suggestion, when you're working on it: you might want to refactor this functionality into a separate public method, returning an array of units. Then use that to build up the string.

Further info:

The limitation mentioned above is actually part of their description of the PHP API: [http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/…](http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_php.html#Reminders) - this creates a bit of a chicken/egg problem. Fix the behaviour to be more flexible or stay compatible with the official docs?

Internally, the Gdata protocol always uses minutes, based on [http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/…](http://code.google.com/intl/en-UK/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#Reminders)
