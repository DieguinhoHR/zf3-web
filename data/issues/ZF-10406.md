### Description

The Zend CLI Tool zf does not support changing the suffix of generated VIEW file. If you create a VIEW (zf create controller Foobar or zf create view foo) it will save a \*.phtml file. The suffix of the filname is hard coded in the ViewScriptFile file. This setting could be changed by reading the application.ini file.
