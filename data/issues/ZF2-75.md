### Description

{quote} Abstract Classes

Abstract classes follow the same conventions as classes, with one additional rule: abstract class names MUST begin with the term, "Abstract". As examples, "AbstractAdapter" and "AbstractWriter" are both considered valid abstract class names.

Abstract classes SHOULD be in the same namespace as concrete implementations. {quote}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ grep -r "abstract class" library/ | grep -v Abstract | grep -v " \* "


Matthew or Ralph, can you add Zend\\Mvc in components list please?
