ZF-7440: Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Profile isLoadableFromFile not using DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR global

### Description

On line 137 of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Profile, a "/" is hard-coded before the file name. This appears to work under Windows, but it is probably bad practice.

Will discuss this with matthew, we have no formal decision on hardcoded / vs. DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR since PHP will do translations in th engine for different filesystems.

This is not bad practice, the '/' is perfectly good usage since PHP will normalize filesystem names when using any type of fopen() functions - particularly on windows.
