### Description

Some of us would like that Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url would return /index/action/param/value if generated on a viewscript in IndexController->actionAction() if called by /index/action?param=value

This is important when doing a search with a search form (using get) if you want to reuse the resulting url in your view by calling the Url View\_Helper.

While trying to write a unittest for the improvement I intended to make, I found that writing ``` will have the desired effect.

So no improvement is needed and no existing applications will be broken.

Resolved as not an issue. See the updated description for a way to reproduce the get parameters using Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url.
