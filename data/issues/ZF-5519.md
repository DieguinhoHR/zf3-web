### Description

It should be possible to provide a plugin that processes the data retrieved from the adapter. This can be used to create your custom models from the paginated data, without subclassing any Paginator classes.

The patched getItemsByPage method would look something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getItemsByPage($pageNumber)
    {
        $pageNumber = $this->normalizePageNumber($pageNumber);
    
        if ($this->_cacheEnabled()) {
            $data = self::$_cache->load($this->_getCacheId($pageNumber));
            if ($data !== false) {
                return $data;
            }
        }
    
        $offset = ($pageNumber - 1) * $this->_itemCountPerPage;
    
        $items = $this->_adapter->getItems($offset, $this->_itemCountPerPage);
    
        if (!$items instanceof Traversable) {
            $items = new ArrayIterator($items);
        }
        
        if ($this->_resultHandler !== null) {
            $items = $this->_resultHandler->handle($items);
        }
    
        if ($this->_cacheEnabled()) {
            self::$_cache->save($items, $this->_getCacheId($pageNumber));
        }
    
        return $items;
    }

I've already said this over IM, but I thought I would write it here in the ticket.

I think the best solution here would be to add an addFilter(Zend\_Filter\_Interface $filter) method and write Zend\_Filter\_Callback. That way you could filter data based on a custom filter or if you simply needed to call back to User::factory() to get User objects instead of an array of data you could just say:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paginator->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_Callback('User', 'factory'));

Resolved in r 13608. Added a setFilter() method which accepts a Zend\_Filter\_Interface object. This can be one filter or a filter chain.
