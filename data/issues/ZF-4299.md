### Description

After reading through the Zend Form documentation several times I still encountered problems attempting to disable 'Zend\_Form\_Element\_Radio' from escaping html characters within my radio button data. Would it be possible to add a section detailing how to achieve this? I eventually discovered that calling $element->setAttrib('escape', false) achieved this but had to resort to debugging to figure this out.

I can also verify that this is a bit of a tough one to figure out without a debugger or reading through the code. Closest thing I could find in the docs is [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.elements.html#zend.form.elements.config)], but 'escape' is not mentioned there. I've attached a patch for that section of the documentation (which also details 'listsep'), however it is possibly incomplete as there may be other elements that use 'escape' which I did not list. Patch submitted anyway in an attempt to be as helpful as possible here.
