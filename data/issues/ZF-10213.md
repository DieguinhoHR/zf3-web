ZF-10213: Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server does not like objects
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-07-23T11:07:54.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:50.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Some of the Zend\_\*\_Server components are not designed to handle objects, mostly due to the fact that the protocols do not support them. However, over the course of building an application it might be nice to be able to pass an object to one of these servers and have it automatically convert it to an array so it can be easily passed to client. One example of this is Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server.

Attached is a patch that modifies Zend\_Server\_Abstract (so most of the \*\_Server components can do this) and a modification to Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server to actually use it.
