### Description

There is already custom code everywhere in the help system and other areas of Zend Tool that aligns text on the center of a line. Also blocks of text are necessary for colorizing or formating longer lines of text with background correctly.

This two tasks could easily be extracted into new ResponseDecorators that automatically does this for you, defaulting to a line-length of 72 chars.

Both blockize and aligncenter were extracted from the help system and added as standalone response decorators in r18853
