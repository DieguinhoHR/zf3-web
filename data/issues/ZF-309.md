### Description

Zend\_Service\_Amazon does currently not return the number of pages a query generated. In Zend/Service/Amazon/ResultSet.php, add

 
    <pre class="literal">
        /**
         * Total Number of pages returned
         *
         * @return int Total number of pages returned
         */
        public function totalPages()
        {
            $result = $this->_xpath->query('//az:TotalPages/text()');
            return (int) $result->item(0)->data;
        }


after line 76.
