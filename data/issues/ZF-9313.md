### Description

IIRC it is stated somewhere that ZF recommends PHP 5.2.3 or above, but since our project is trying to support 5.1.3 and above, can we address the PHP 5.2.0 syntax issue (as seen in ZF-1743) where it arises? e.g.,

$identifier1->$identifier2['array']

I used the following regex to identify files:

grep -R -E '->[a-zA-Z0-9\_]+->[a-zA-Z0-9\_]+[' Zend | fgrep -v .svn

Part of the reason we upped the minimum supported PHP version (to 5.2.4 starting with ZF 1.7.0) is so that we do not need to have workarounds that were necessary in 5.1.x. We will not provide fixes/changes that correct issues only found in PHP versions under our minimum supported version.
