Thanks for this report. This issue has been resolved in the build script in trunk and merged into the 1.5 release branch (see ZF-2917). I'm going to see if Zend is able to patch this file into the release.

In the meantime, please download the following file and include it in your Zend library directory: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/branch/release-1.5/library/Zend/Registry.php)

Thanks!

Cheers, -Ryan
