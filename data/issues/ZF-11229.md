ZF-11229: Ability to change path specification of controller classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2011-03-26T17:53:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-29T17:21:37.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently class names for controllers can be only in this format {Module}{backslash}{ControllerName}. Consider the following structure:

\\src ---\\Zend ---\\App ------\\Def ---------\\Controller ------------\\IndexController.php ------\\SomeModule

This is a structure more similar to a java application but it should be considered non the less. It would be nice for index controller to have the following class: \\App\\Def\\Controller\\IndexController. This way controllers would adhere to the standard package naming pattern.

This is already planned for the ZF2 MVC implementation; we will be publishing proposals for the implementation (vs. the interfaces) in the next 1-2 weeks.

This has been fixed in ZF2 MVC.
