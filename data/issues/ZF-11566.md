### Description

Hello,

I was working with Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty and was using the array notation to configure the class. I noticed the the documentation was incorrect on how to use the array method.

Currently, the the figure under the subheader "Changing behaviour for Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty" says this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Returns false on 0 or '0'
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty(array(
        Zend_Validate_NotEmpty::INTEGER,
        Zend_Validate_NotEmpty::ZERO
    ));
     
    // Returns false on 0 or '0'
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty(array(
        'integer',
        'zero',
    ));


It should be this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Returns false on 0 or '0'
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty(array(
        'type' => array(
            Zend_Validate_NotEmpty::INTEGER,
            Zend_Validate_NotEmpty::ZERO
        )
    ));
     
    // Returns false on 0 or '0'
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty(array(
        'type' => array(
            'integer',
            'zero'
        )
    ));


Thanks.

You bet, Sorry about that. I just noticed it has been "In Progress" since the 28th of July. Didn't look like anyone was working on it. So I thought I'd knock it out real quick.

Fixed in ZF2 with [GH-286](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/286)
