### Description

It would be nice if Zend Form supported setting the action based on a route registered with the router, this way the user doesn't have to either build the action url himself, or even use static urls. A simple method for it could look like:

 
    /**
     * set the action based on a route
     *
     * @param array $params
     * @param string $routeName
     * @param bool $reset
     */
    public function setRouteAction($params = array(), $routeName = null, $reset = false)
    {
        $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        //the FC
    
        $router = $frontController->getRouter();
        //the router (assumes rewrite router)
    
        if ($reset) {
            $routeName = 'default';
        }
        //hmm... this may lead to unexpected results
        //but so will getting the current route name
    
        if ($routeName == null) {
            try {
                $routeName = $router->getCurrentRouteName();
            } catch (Zend_Controller_Router_Exception $e) {
                $routeName = 'default';
            }
        }
        //requested routename/default
    
        $route = $router->getRoute($routeName);
        //the requested route
    
        $action = rtrim($frontController->getBaseUrl(), '/');
        $action .= '/' . $route->assemble($params, $reset);
    
        $this->setAction($action);
    }

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Please use either the url action or view helper for this functionality; there's no reason to duplicate this logic yet again.
