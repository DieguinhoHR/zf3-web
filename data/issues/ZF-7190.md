### Description

In the function \_outputData, the ob\_flush didn't work, I add ob\_end\_flush(). I do'nt know why it wasn't working but maybe it will be usefull for someone.

 
        ob_end_flush(); 
        ob_flush(); 
        flush(); 
        ob_start();

Could you please provide a test case where the current flush-method does not work? I'm unable to reproduce it.

The problem should come from the configuration of php.ini I think. (output\_buffering = On)

Here are more informations in the comments: <http://php.net/manual/fr/function.ob-flush.php>

Is there a bad consequence of the code I post? I think it is better to put this one if it is working with more php configuration.
