### Description

It'd be nice if the insert-method of the Zend\_Db\_Adapter would support as a third argument an array of column-value-pairs that sets the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE parameter.

This will allow us to use REPLACE-functionality that is AFAIK proprietary to MySQL with standard SQL syntax.

The "ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" is proprietary syntax introduced in MySQL 4.1. It is not standard SQL, and other RDBMS brands do not support it.

The workaround is to attempt the insert(), catch the exception if there is a duplicate key violation, and then perform the update() instead. This works on all RDBMS brands.
