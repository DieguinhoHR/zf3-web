ZF2-352: Zend\\Mail\\Message has no setReturnPath method
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Mail component of ZF2 uses the "From" email address as the "sender email address" ([https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php#L237)). In ZF2 there is no method Zend\\Mail\\Message::setReturnPath that allows me to specify a different "sender email address" to collect bounces in a separate inbox (separate from replies). However, such a method exists in ZF1. Could you please port this method to ZF2?

Just found the method Zend\\Mail\\Message::setSender, so this issue can be closed!

There are two ways to accomplish this. As you noted, setSender() is one. The other is to manually specify a Return-Path header ($message->headers()->add('Return-Path', $email), or something like that).
