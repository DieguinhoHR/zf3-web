ZF-5967: Regex route does not assemble url when urlOptions is using associative arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Normally when using url view helper

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->url(array('foo' => 'bar'))


associative array is being used

However when using this with route

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regexabc/([0-9a-z\-]{3,40}).htmlabcindex1abc/%s.html

Too few arguments exception is thrown in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex, because associative array can not be put in vsprintf() therefore i suggest treat urlOptions with array\_values() which return zero-based index array which is suitable for vsprintf()

got the same issue, resolved in following way:

Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regexnews/(\\d+),(.+).htmlindexnewsshow  
  
itemdescnews/%s,%s.html
