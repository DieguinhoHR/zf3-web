ZF-193: Zend\_Config\_Array::load : PHP notice when throwing exception
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-07-05T03:09:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.5 (11/Jul/06)

### Description

When $config is not set, throwing the exception :

throw new Zend\_Config\_Exception("Cannot find $config array in $filename");

triggers a PHP notice:

Undefined variable: config in path-to-ZF-library/Zend/Config/Array.php on line 58

my fix is to replace the double quotes with simple quotes:

throw new Zend\_Config\_Exception('Cannot find $config array in $filename');

Fixed on the trunk, so should make it into 0.1.5.

Thanks for the report Michel!

I realized after reporting the issue that my fix was incorrect. I'm glad you didn't follow it!
