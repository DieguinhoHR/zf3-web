### Description

Method setOptions doesn't allow user\_agent option. But this is only one possibility to customize user-agent. I don't know why it's not allowed. Probably one reason is to allow to user customize user-agent via stream\_context, but it doesn't work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $opts = array('http' =>
        array(
            'user_agent' => 'custom'
        )
    );
    $context  = stream_context_create($opts);
    
    $client = new SoapClient($wsdl, 
        array( 
            'context_stream' => $context
            //'user_agent' => 'custom'
        )
    );
    


It's probably supposed to work, but it isn't. The only one way to customize user-agen - is to uncomment 'user\_agent' option.

I've descovered only one way to do it without changes in ZF:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _initTestSoapClient($wsdl) {
            $client = new Zend_Soap_Client($wsdl);
            $options = array_merge($client->getOptions(), array(
                'user_agent' => 'custom'
            ));
            $soapClient = new Zend_Soap_Client_Common(array($client, '_doRequest'), $wsdl, $options);
            $client->setSoapClient($soapClient);
            return $client;
        }


It doesn't seem good, so, I believe introducing new available option in setOptions is a reasonable idea.
