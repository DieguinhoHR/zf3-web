ZF-8679: Zend\_Validate\_File\_IsImage: late static binding issue with Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType::isValid()

### Description

Zend\_Validate\_File\_IsImage introduces a late static binding issue with the Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType::isValid(). When isValid throws an exception, it is unable to read the error messages defined in \_messageTemplates, and results in an empty exception message. Attached is a demonstration of this issue in its simplest form.

Until ZF officially requires PHP >= 5.3, the use of static:: won't be available. The attached patch adds a copy of Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType::isValid() for Zend\_Validate\_File\_IsImage so that the message templates will be accessible. Without this patch, validation ultimately fails because there is no way to tell what exactly failed in the validator.

The wiki parsed the demonstration code incorrectly, so I am adding it as a file to this ticket.

Removed the quoted PHP code in favor of the attached demo-ZF8679.php.
