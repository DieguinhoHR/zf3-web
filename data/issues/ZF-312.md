### Description

/svn/framework/trunk/documentation/manual/en/module\_specs/Zend\_Db\_Profiler.xml:

$totalTime = $profiler->gettotalElapsedSeconds(); should be: $totalTime = $profiler->getTotalElapsedSecs();

echo 'Average query length: ' . $queryCount / $totalTime . ' seconds' . "\\n"; should be: echo 'Average query length: ' . $totalTime / $queryCount . ' seconds' . "\\n";

The getTotalElapsedSeconds is fixed.

The second one seems fine math in my eyes. Reopen the issue if I am wrong.

Fixed in changeset 981

My eyes don't think it's fine math ;) Se example below.

time = 15.3 queries = 3

time / queries = 5.10

queries / time = 0.19

Thanks guys. I added the second example, and relabeled the first to "queries per second".

Great, I don't wanna be a pain in the ass but i suppose echo 'Queries per second: ' . $queryCount / $totalTime . ' seconds' . "\\n"; should be echo 'Queries per second: ' . $queryCount / $totalTime . "\\n";

:)
