### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_AttendeeStatus has a \_value property. Due to how \_value is checked for not being null in getDOM, empty string values are considered null, and thus the value attribute is not added to the DOM.

This check (and others) should check !== null rather than != null
