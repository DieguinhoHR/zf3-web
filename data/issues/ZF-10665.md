ZF-10665: Zend\_Http\_UserAgent may die on serialization

### Description

When serializing a user agent, for example, during a unit test for which there is no device, a fatal error is thrown.

Debug Error: D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework-1.11.0\\library\\Zend\\Http\\UserAgent.php line 178 - Call to a member function serialize() on a non-object

 
    public function serialize()


{ $spec = array( 'browser\_type' => $this->\_browserType, 'config' => $this->\_config, 'device\_class' => get\_class($this->\_device), 'device' => $this->\_device->serialize(), <--- This is the offending call 'user\_agent' => $this->getServerValue('http\_user\_agent'), 'http\_accept' => $this->getServerValue('http\_accept'), ); return serialize($spec); }

This is presumably due to the fact that I have a user agent resource loading up using Zend\_Application during a unit test, for which no device can be found.

This problem is very simple:

\_device is \*lazy loaded\* and initialized in getDevice(). This means that any direct reference to \_device will break, even within the class.

The fix can be as easy as using this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function serialize()
        {
            $spec = array(
                'browser_type' => $this->_browserType,
                'config'       => $this->_config,
                'device_class' => get_class($this->getDevice()),
                'device'       => $this->getDevice()->serialize(),
                'user_agent'   => $this->getServerValue('http_user_agent'),
                'http_accept'  => $this->getServerValue('http_accept'),
            );
            return serialize($spec);
        }


Would be happy if someone could check this in.

Made a fix patch for René Treffer's fix, and enclosed a unit test in the file: ZF-10665-rtuin.patch
