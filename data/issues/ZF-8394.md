ZF-8394: Zend Tool cannot handle hyphenated action name
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-11-25T12:28:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-10-21T09:13:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When creating an action named foo-bar I would expect the action name in the controller to be camel cased, but instead it keeps the action name as is.

This causes an error with the CLI when you try to create another action on the same controller: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '-', expecting '('

The view scripts are correctly left as is.

if you think about it from an OO perspective, each action is a method of a class. so calling index action of index controller calls: IndexController::indexAction()

if you called an action 'test-action' then it would call: IndexController::test-actionAction()

the hyphen character is not a valid method naming character, therefore this is not a bug. if you want to have hyphenated urls, consider using Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static, or a rewrite rule in your .htaccess

urls initially map to /controllername/actionname

calling ControllernameController::actionnameAction, if Zend\_Tool was to camel case the action name then it would have to also create a rewrite rule/static route so you could access the hyphenated action. I think this would be cause Zend\_Tool to undertake too much work by having to generate extra code.

- sorry for all the edits, it's early

I did not expect the method to be named with the hypen, I expected it to be camel-cased.

So if I called an action test-action in the index controller it would call IndexController::testActionAction() not IndexController::testactionAction()

I understand the use of Routers so I am happy to use them.

However, I feel Zend Tool should block the input of illegal characters. Ideally this should be done when creating a controller and action.

My other issue is that part camel-cased action names look wrong, but that's just my opinion :)

What are your thoughts?

Can be closed I think. When I try to add a hyphenated action, I get an error message as expected.

zf create action foo-bar user

An Error Has Occurred Action names should be camel cased.

This was fixed with the "canonicalization" of names patch in 1.10 (I am pretty sure that is when that error message came in).
