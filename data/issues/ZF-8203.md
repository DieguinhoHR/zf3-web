### Description

I have created a form with several "belongsTo" form elements. When I load the values on POST like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($this->getRequest()->isPost() && $form->isValid($this->getRequest()->getPost())
    {
        $values = $form->getValues();
        Zend_Debug::dump($values)
    }


$values now differs from $this->getReuquest()->getPost() and could not populate its data to the form!

Data-Array to fill the form.
