### Description

Add the ability to pass an INI string to Zend\_Config\_Ini and have it parse the string.

At present, it is not possible to parse an INI string via Zend\_Config\_Ini. The string must be written to a file first.

As soon as we get to PHP 5.3 as minimum, we can do this as parse\_ini\_string() will be available.

We can do so on trunk already?

Here is my hack:

I inherit from Zend\_Config\_Ini and copy and paste the method \_parseIniFile($filename).

In this method i changed the parse\_ini\_file() function to parse\_ini\_string().

Perhaps there should be some better approach using an abstract class from which Zend\_Config\_Ini and Zend\_Config\_String should inherit.

Fixed in ZF2 with Zend\\Config\\Reader\\Ini::fromString()
