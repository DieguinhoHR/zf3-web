### Description

ZendX\_Console\_Process\_Unix::isRunning() does not return false when process has completed. Tested on current SVN trunk ( [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/extras/trunk/library/ZendX) - Revision: 21563 ).

_Code to replicated issue:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    // test.php 
    
    include ("ZendX/Console/Process/Unix.php");
    /**
     * Similar example from <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zendx.console.process.unix.overview.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>
     */
    class ProcessX extends ZendX_Console_Process_Unix {
    
        protected function _run() {
            for ( $i=1; $i<=5; ++$i ) {
                sleep(1);
            }
        }
    
    }
    
    $process1 = new ProcessX();
    $process1->start();
    $pid1 = $process1->getPid();
    
    echo ("Process 1 started with pid {$pid1}\n");
    
    $process2 = new ProcessX();
    $process2->start();
    $pid2 = $process2->getPid();
    
    echo ("Process 2 started with pid {$pid2}\n");
    
    $i=0;
    while ( $process1->isRunning() || $process2->isRunning() ) {
    
        ++$i;
        echo "{$i}. waiting for processes to complete\n";
        
        // Monitor process from shell
        passthru("ps | grep {$pid1}");
        passthru("ps | grep {$pid2}");
        
        sleep(1);
        
        // Processes should be completed after 5 seconds.
        if ( $i>8 ) {
            fwrite(STDERR, "ERROR: Processes SHOULD be completed by now...\n");
            exit(1);
        }
    
    }
    
    // Never reach this line
    echo "All process completed\n";
    


_Output from Code execution:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # php test.php 
    Process 1 started with pid 30635
    Process 2 started with pid 30636

Tested on both _Mac OS X 10.6 / PHP 5.3.1_ and _Gentoo Linux / PHP 5.2.12_ with similar result.

I think possible solution is :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isEnd(){
            
        $output = shell_exec("ps | grep {$this->getPid()} | grep -v grep | wc -l");
            
        if ( 0 == $output ) return true;
        
        return false;
    }   


isRunning is as an answer for "is Never Start?" and isEnd() is a way for controll the process.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    while(!$process->isEnd()){
        sleep(1);
    }

ps and grep isn't the best tool for this. if another process started with the same pid between two isEnd call, your code will think that the process isn't finished yet.

Agreed with Tyrael. Execute commands via shell as NOT a solution. It won't work on chroot environment. We need a fix using PCNTL, Semaphore or POSIX functions.

I also confirm this to be a valid problem.

I proposed a solution(and patch) for this kind of situation at: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8176>

@Ferenc,

Yes, I am using your patch located at: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8176> It seems to be working fine. I've been running it in pre-released code for about a week now.

You should notify the maintainer or someone on the dev mailing list / IRC to get it applied.

I confirm that this is a major problem, because the component is almost non-functional. When he can be fix ?

The example of the official documentation does not finish.
