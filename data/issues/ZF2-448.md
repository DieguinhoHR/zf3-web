MySQL platform:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$sql = new Sql($adapter);
    $select = $sql->select()->from('sometable')->limit(20);

is this PDO or Mysqli?

Thank you for looking into this issue.

I am using PDO. I am using Zend\\Db in a legacy system and init. code goes something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">if ($driver instanceof \PDO) {
      $driver = new Zend\Db\Adapter\Pdo($driver);
    }
    $adapter = new Adapter($driver);

I will test this against mysqli driver and report back!

PS Thank you, and those who contributed, for this wonderful component!

It will fail there too- the problem with mysql is that even though these are values and should technically be capable of being quoted as values, it's not accepting them. I will have to write some SQL abstraction classes to make this possible. In the mean time, if you prepare and execute this, it should work.
