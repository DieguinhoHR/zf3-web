Assemble method uses route defaults already. See unit tests.

If you have meant something else by that please provide working code sample explaining what you want to accomplish.

Ok, after re-thinking it I guess I understandyour meaning now. You wish Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route to act similarly to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module - not to add parts to resulting URL when parameters ar marked as defaults, ie. when they're not required. Reopenning.

bug is still actual in version 1.9.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    resources.router.routes.promo.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route"
    resources.router.routes.promo.route = "promo/:action/*"
    resources.router.routes.promo.defaults.module = "promo"
    resources.router.routes.promo.defaults.controller = "index"
    resources.router.routes.promo.defaults.action = "index"


 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $this->view->url(array(
                    'module'=>'promo',
                    'controller'=>'index',
                    'action'=>'test',
                    'par'=>'value'
                ),
                'promo',true)


I get: /promo/test/module/promo/controller/index/par/value I want: /promo/test/par/value
