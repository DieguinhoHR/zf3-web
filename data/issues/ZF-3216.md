### Description

Correct me if I'm wrong but I found no possible way to catch MySQL error codes when using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli. All exceptions are thrown without attaching error code.

Affected methods inside Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli are: public function \_prepare() public function \_execute()

An easy/dirty fix would be replacing: throw new Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception("Mysqli prepare error: " . $mysqli->error); ... with: throw new Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception("Mysqli prepare error: " . $mysqli->error, $mysqli->errno); ...

Patch which adds a second parameter to Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception to track error number as well as error message

Since the patch has not been applied, does that mean that "next minor release" status can be disregarded?

I'm desperately looking for this fix as well.

This issue has gone unaddressed for too long. I'm re-assigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

Will address this issue within 2 weeks. Find me on IRC within the next week.

The patch above addresses the issue when applied to the current ZF trunk. Also, I see no need to patch the exception class, as the base class is already expecting a numeric error code.

Assigning to Josh Butts. Setting priority to "Minor". Setting "Nice to Have" in the "Next Mini Release"

Patch looks good. As noted in our discussion, add @group ZF-3216 to the docblock. Commit to trunk, merge to 1.9 branch.

Thanks!
