### Description

Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    <?php
    
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    
    $date->set(2008, Zend_Date::YEAR);
    $date->set(1, Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date->set(31, Zend_Date::DAY);
    $date->set('00:00:00', Zend_Date::TIMES);
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($date->get(Zend_Date::DATE_FULL));
    Zend_Debug::dump($date->get(Zend_Date::TIME_FULL));
    
    $date->set(2, Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date->set(1, Zend_Date::DAY);
    $date->set('00:00:00', Zend_Date::TIMES);
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($date->get(Zend_Date::DATE_FULL));
    Zend_Debug::dump($date->get(Zend_Date::TIME_FULL));
    
    ?>
    


Output:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    string 'Thursday, January 31, 2008' (length=26)
    string '12:00:00 AM EET' (length=15)
    
    string 'Saturday, March 1, 2008' (length=23)
    string '12:00:00 AM EET' (length=15)
    


p.s. This is with latest trunk version.

I see no problem in the returned date. Can you clearify your problem ? What did you expect to be returned ?

OK.

First I set:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date->set(2008, Zend_Date::YEAR);
    $date->set(1, Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date->set(31, Zend_Date::DAY);
    $date->set('00:00:00', Zend_Date::TIMES);


Result:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    string 'Thursday, January 31, 2008' (length=26)
    string '12:00:00 AM EET' (length=15)
    CORRECT


Then I set:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date->set(2, Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date->set(1, Zend_Date::DAY);
    $date->set('00:00:00', Zend_Date::TIMES);


Result:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    string 'Saturday, March 1, 2008' (length=23)
    string '12:00:00 AM EET' (length=15)
    WRONG
    Expecting 1 February!

I see no problem. Wether in the first nor in the second part.

||Code||Resulting date|| |$date = new Zend\_Date();|12.February.2009 10:20:30| |$date->set(2008, Zend\_Date::YEAR);|12.February.2008 10:20:30| |$date->set(1, Zend\_Date::MONTH);|12.Jannuary.2008 10:20:30| |$date->set(31, Zend\_Date::DAY);|31.Jannuary.2008 10:20:30|

This is correct.. no problem Now you are going on with the previous date: ||Code||Resulting date|| |non|31.Jannuary.2008 10:20:30| |$date->set(2, Zend\_Date::MONTH);|31.February.2008 10:20:30|

Sorry, but there is no 31. February. As you did not correctly set the extendMonths option your date is automatically corrected. This means 31.February is identical with 03.March.

||Code||Resulting date|| |$date->set(2, Zend\_Date::MONTH);|3.March.2008 10:20:30| |$date->set(1, Zend\_Date::DAY);|1.March.2008 10:20:30|

As said before: Zend\_Date does exactly what you requested. When you don't want to have the "Excel" behaviour, you must set the extendMonths option. The manual holds a own paragraph about the behaviour, and even in the FAQ this misbehaviour is mentioned.

Closing as non-issue. Wrong usage of date maths.
