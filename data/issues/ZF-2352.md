### Description

the code of that part of function is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                case 'week':
                    self::_getFile($locale, '/ldml/dates/calendars/calendar[@type=\''
                                 . $value . '\']/week/minDays', 'count', 'mindays');
                    self::_getFile($locale, '/ldml/dates/calendars/calendar[@type=\''
                                 . $value . '\']/week/firstDay', 'day', 'firstday');
                    break;


but it won't work because the data was moved in the supplementaldata.xml file

This one is part of the internal cldr method. It has been implemented in favor of the Zend\_Calendar class which has not been approved for now.

Therefor this function is not part of the testbed for now and not supposed to work until Zend\_Calendar has been completed.
