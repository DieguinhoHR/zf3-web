### Description

 btw weierophinney, do you happen to know why zend\_timesync isn't listed on the right side here? <http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/> ... Freeaqingme\_: no clue. Probably an oversight. :) weierophinney, I suppose one should make sure it gets added? Freeaqingme\_: put an issue in the tracker so I don't forget. :P

Waht do I need to say more....
