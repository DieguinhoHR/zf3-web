### Description

FormButton creates a button element instead of an input element in ZF 1.5.0RC1. This causes layout and javascript issues when updating ZF from older versions, as it returned before.

FormButton was changed as a result of ZF-2605. Having formButton() generate a true element gives more flexibility in what can be rendered in a button -- for instance, the potential for HTML markup.

This _is_ a BC break, and will be noted in the Changelog for the final 1.5.0 GA release.

If you do not like this behavior, it is trivial to create an alternate formButton() implementation and to place it in your own helper path.
