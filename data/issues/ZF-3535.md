### Description

I think it is very useful to add an virtual "AUTO"-type to display like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $length = new ZendMeasure_Length(1000.00, Zend_Measure_Length::METER);
    echo $length->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Length::METER_AUTO);  // -> Display "1 km"
    echo $length->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Length::AUTO);  // -> Display the auto type of the defined STANDARD type

Just use the STANDARD definition

Zend\_Measure\_Length::STANDARD resolves to meter as meter is the default length definition world wide. Zend\_Measure\_Force::STANDARD resolves to newton... and so on.

This feature is available since the class has arrived incubator.

Hi Thomas

I don't mean the already implemented "STANDARD" type because the "STANDARD" type is only the default type for a specific measure. On my example above the "STANDARD" type would be display "1000 m" but not "1 km".

On my project I like to display a short value for a time measure. This is a other example to to this issue: ( Zend\_Measure\_Time is from ZF-3536 )

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // e.g $row->durationMs == 5400000 == 1,5h 
    $videoDuration = new Zend_Measure_Time($row->durationMs, Zend_Measure_Time::MILLISECOND);
    echo $videoDuration->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Time::STANDARD, 2);  // display "90 min"
    echo $videoDuration->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Time::AUTO, 2);  // This can display "1.5 h"
    // -> next row
    // e.g $row->durationMs == 34534
    $videoDuration = new Zend_Measure_Time($row->durationMs, Zend_Measure_Time::MILLISECOND);
    echo $videoDuration->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Time::STANDARD, 2);  // display "0.78 min"
    echo $videoDuration->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Time::AUTO, 2);  // This can display "34.53 s"


The "AUTO" type can create the shortest way to display the value by the given precision.

In some measures more type groups are available e.g. Zend\_Measure\_Length - based on meters - based on miles Than it can handled by more "AUTO" types like Zend\_Measure\_Length::METER\_AUTO and Zend\_Measure\_Length::MILE\_AUTO. A only selected "AUTO" type can use the defined "[GROUP]\_AUTO" type for the "STANDARD" type. -> On Zend\_Measure\_Length it would be Zend\_Measure\_Length::METER\_AUTO.

This is not possible.

Several measurements can not be automatically converted between same types because they will then miss informations or be converted to a false scale.

See Length for example: Inch... which to convert to ?? Feet\_Us, Feet\_French, Feet\_Italian, Feet\_Survey ???

There is no practicable way to have such a grouping implemented. But you can do this yourself, if you know which conversion units you want to convert to... There is a getValue, and a getType method.... a simple switch statement and you can decide which unit to convert to.

mh ok - This I have not thought. But very thanks for your donated time.

Closed as "won't fix" after reviewing it once again.

It's not possible to use one fixed scale like Meter-> Kilometer and so on... many scales use multiple subscales like mentioned in past not only for length but also for other measurements.
