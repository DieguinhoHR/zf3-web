### Description

Subquery factoring is useful for dealing with complex SQL. Ref: [http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2008/10/â€¦](http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2008/10/19/inline-views-table-fabrication-andthe-with-clause/)

Do you guys have any plans for it? Or is it already implemented somewhere?
