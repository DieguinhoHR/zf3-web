### Description

version 1.11.9 seems to haven introduced a bug in the automatic detection of locales via directory scanning.

I use the following setup:

The default locale is set to "en"

Zend\_Translate is configured with the following options:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $translate = new Zend_Translate(
      array(
        'adapter' => 'gettext',
        'content' => APPLICATION_PATH . "/locale",
        'scan'    => Zend_Translate::LOCALE_DIRECTORY,
      )
    );
    Zend_Registry::set('Zend_Translate', $translate);


The directory structure containing the gettext files is as follows

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    APPLICATION_PATH
      locale
        de
          LC_MESSAGES
            messages.mo
        en
          LC_MESSAGES
            messages.mo
        fr
          LC_MESSAGES
            messages.mo


When i upgraded from version 1.11.8 to 1.11.9 only one locale was fetched. It was recognized as the default locale ("en" in my case), although it contained the translation strings of the last locale in the content-directory.

The problem seems to be caused by the new code on line 248 in Zend\_Translator\_Adapter.

The iterator seems to contain only files and no directories, so the different locales never get identified and correctly added.

Based on the code from version 1.11.8 i added the RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF\_FIRST parameter to the RecursiveIteratorIterator constructor. This seems to have solved the problem.
