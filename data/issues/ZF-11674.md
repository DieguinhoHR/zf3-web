ZF-11674: InArray validator saying "not found in haystack" even though it is

### Description

I have a form with a select element:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    class Form_MyForm extends Zend_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $arrayOfOptions = array(1 => 'One');
            $this->addElement('select', 'myselect', array('multiOptions' => $arrayOfOptions));
    
            // Later on, I add an option that should be part of the select options:
            if ($optionShouldBeAdded) {
                $this->myselect->addMultiOption(2, 'Two');
            }
        }
    }


In my controller, I have code like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Form_MyForm();
    
    if (!$this->_request->isPost()) {
        $this->view->form = $form;
        return;
    }
    if (!$form->isValid($_POST)) {
        //display errors
        $this->view->form = $form;
        return;
    }
    //form is now valid, save the data


When I submit my form with the added option, I get the validation error: '2' was not found in the haystack, even though it is a valid option.

Also, I tried removing the InArray validator (which I should not be doing since my option should not be invalid):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    class Form_MyForm extends Zend_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            //...
    
            $this->myselect->setRegisterInArrayValidator(false);
        }
    }


...but this did not work. Only passing it as an option upon element creation was I able to remove the InArray validator:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement('select', 'myselect', array('registerInArrayValidator' => false, 'multiOptions' => $arrayOfOptions));


So this seems like a bug also.

This appears to be a non-issue.

It looks like you are adding the MultiOption after the isValid call, which would mean that the value is not present when the InArray validator is run.

I'm going to close this because as it stands, it appears to be purely a support request, for support please use the fw-general mailing list, of #zftalk on freenode irc.

If you can supply a reproduce case which can prove this is not the case, then please re-open.

You are incorrect in your assumption that I am adding the multiOption after the isValid call. I updated my code sample to explain more fully the actual scenario.

Please re-open this ticket, since it is an actual bug, not a support request. =]

Given the information you supplied, it was a perfectly reasonable assumption, and a very common mistake.

and please, make further updates in comments, rather than updating the description. it makes it very hard for anyone to follow whats changing.

Bah! Nevermind. I figured out my problem. There was a bug in my code. I was instantiating the parent form, not the subclassed form which contained the addMultiOption code. Sorry to bother you!!
