### Description

To allow the jQuery helpers to support different versions of UI and jQuery libraries with maybe different APIs it should be possible to set which version is used by the code to allow the following calls on the jQuery view Helper:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    setUiVersion($version);
    getUiVersion();
    setVersion($version);
    getVersion();


This is currently supported for the CDN already, but should also be possible in general for locally loaded code.
