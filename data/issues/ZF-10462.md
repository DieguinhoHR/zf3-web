ZF-10462: Zend Framework not compatible with Java Lucene index version 2.3.2?

### Description

Need to use existing index created by standard java Lucene components (current / newest version 2.3.2) which reside in an existing Content Management System. This worked with Zend Framework when the Java application created a Version 2.0 Lucene index, and we used ZF 1.7.2. These indexes still work with all current ZF versions (tried them up to 1.10.7).

Now the java application has upgraded to the newest libraries (2.3.2) and produces a version 2.3 catalogue. ZF fails to handle the catalog with various symptoms:

- Search seems to work, but trying to retrieve custom fields from a hit ($hit->myfield) makes ZF claim that there is no such field
- Access to documents (->getDocument) fails with PHP trying to allocate >100MB of RAM (the test index has only 500k!) in /filesystem/file.php while trying to fread()
- The "abstract" field of any document seems to contain endless garbage

I would like to think that the index is corrupt, but Luke (using the current Java libs, of course) retrieves the index, all documents, all expected fields and their content just fine. An example index can be made available on request.
