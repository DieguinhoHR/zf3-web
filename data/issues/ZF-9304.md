All statements that define as public, but the coding standard assumes that it's protected.

While this is a seemingly trivial issue to fix, it has the potential to cause issues in the wild that simply out-weigh the need for the fix. In short, it is possible for consumers of Zend\_Db\_Statement to override the parent functionality of execute() and never need to call a \_execute() method. Adding this patch would cause issues for people who have based their products around Zend\_Db, and that may have extended Zend\_Db\_Statement, and overridden execute().

While this is a good patch in theory, there are BC issues at play.

Since there will be an architectural overhaul at 2.0 time, this will be resolve thn in that code base. Please keep an eye on Zend/DB 2.0 development.

Thanks for your report and patch. -ralph
