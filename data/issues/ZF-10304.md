### Description

Similar to ZF-928

given the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->setSubject('my subject');
    $mail->setBodyText('my body');
    $mail->setFrom('from@myserver.com');
    $mail->addTo('to.address@email.com');
    $mail->addBcc('first.bcc@email.com');
    $mail->addBcc('second.bcc@email.com');
    print_r($mail);
    $mail->send();


First off, the print\_r($mail) output before sending the mail shows the Bcc's as \_recipients (which later make their way onto the To: line

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        [_headers:protected] => Array
            (
                [Subject] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => my subject
                    )
    
                [From] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => from@myserver.com
                        [append] => 1
                    )
    
                [To] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => to.address@email.com
                        [append] => 1
                    )
    
                [Bcc] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => first.bcc@email.com
                        [append] => 1
                        [1] => second.bcc@email.com
                    )
    
            )
    
        [_from:protected] => from@myserver.com
        [_to:protected] => Array
            (
                [0] => to.address@email.com
            )
    
        [_recipients:protected] => Array
            (
                [to.address@email.com] => 1
                [first.bcc@email.com] => 1
                [second.bcc@email.com] => 1
            )


The resulting email got the following messed up headers:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    To: to.address@email.com,first.bcc@email.com,second.bcc@email.com
    From: from@myserver.com
     second.bcc@email.com


When running the test again without the 'From' header, the results are as such:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    To: to.address@email.com,first.bcc@email.com,second.bcc@email.com
     second.bcc@email.com


I would mark this higher than Major if at all possible due to the privacy issues involved.

My own alterations to fix this in the short-term include removing the $this->EOL from the implode() inside \_prepareHeaders() and having getRecipients() return $this->\_to rather than array\_keys($this->\_recipients);

Tested against r23236 and cannot reproduce. The unit test for ZF-928 -- testZf928ToAndBccHeadersShouldNotMix() located in tests/Zend/Mail/MailTest.php) -- seems to cover this. Please re-open with a working test case if the problem persists.

What mail transport are you using?
