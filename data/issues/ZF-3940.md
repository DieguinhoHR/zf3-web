### Description

Neither the put() nor delete() methods seem to be working, unless you pass raw post data. I tried both these syntaxes, with no luck (in the end I just used Zend\_Http\_Client):

$rest = new Zend\_Rest\_Client('<http://myservice>'); $rest->myparam('myval'); //... $result = $rest->put();

and

$rest = new Zend\_Rest\_Client('<http://myservice>'); $data = array( 'myparam' => 'myval', //... ) $result = $rest->put($data);

Hi, Lorenzo.

You use also Zend\_Rest\_Server on server , <http://myservice> ?

If you so, it seems to depend on ZF-4024.

No, I was not using Zend\_Rest\_Server
