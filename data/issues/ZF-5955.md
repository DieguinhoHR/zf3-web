### Description

Hi,

I am proposing a small change to Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable so would be easier to use it.

//let's see this derived class.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Model_Auth extends Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable
    {
        protected $_tableName = 'users';
        protected $_identityColumn = 'email';
        protected $_credentialColumn = 'password';
        protected $_credentialTreatment = 'MD5(?)';
        
        public function __construct($username, $password)
        {
            $this->_zendDb = Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter();
            
            $this->_identity = $username;
            $this->_credential = $password;
        }
    }


This has very few code, and most of required data is added for protected members on members definition. As:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_tableName = 'users'; 
    protected $_identityColumn = 'email'; 
    protected $_credentialColumn = 'password';
    protected $_credentialTreatment = 'MD5(?)';


I am proposing to add two more protected members to this class: $\_returnColumns $\_omitColumns

Reason is to simplify calls to getResultRowObject more, to actually have the possibility to set directly on function definition the returnColumns and omitColumns.

I think this would make such ugly call (with the most ugly fact that we need to expose directly the password field) more like a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract derived class, where you are actually encouraged to set most things directly into definition than calling some functions. this would improve also security of data stored on object.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth->getStorage()->write($adapter->getResultRowObject(null, 'password'));


->

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected $_returnColumns = null;
        protected $_omitColumns = 'password';


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth->getStorage()->write($adapter->getResultRowObject());


We should of course also keep the possibility to pass those two params to getResultRowObject.
