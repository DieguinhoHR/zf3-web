### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('pdo_mysql', array (
            'host'     => $config->database->host,
            'username' => $config->database->username,
            'password' => $config->database->password,
            'dbname'   => $config->database->name)
    );


Running this query works:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->query("SELECT * FROM kund WHERE foretag REGEXP '.*a+[[:space:]]*b.*' ");


But this doesn't:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->query("SELECT * FROM kund WHERE foretag REGEXP '.*a+[[:space:]]*ö.*' ");


An exeption is being thrown .. Message: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: no parameters were bound File: /home/test/lib/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php:156

I'm running version 1020 from SVN.

Would you have time to poke around a little in the code and trouble shoot this Patrik? I would also be curious if the same problem occurs when using PDO directly (no ZF).

Sure, what do you want me to do?

Seems to work when using PDO directly, I've tried the code below and it works.

try { $dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 'user', 'pass'); foreach ($dbh->query("SELECT \* FROM kund WHERE foretag REGEXP '.a+[[:space:]]\*ö.' ") as $row) { print\_r($row); } $dbh = null; } catch (PDOException $e) { print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "  
"; die(); }

Little more information ..

The following queries works: UPDATE foo SET title='Övrigt arbete' WHERE id=1 UPDATE foo SET title='Xvrigt arbete', dt='2006-09-28 10:00:00' WHERE id=1

The following query doesn't works: UPDATE foo SET title='Övrigt arbete', dt='2006-09-28 10:00:00' WHERE id=1

So it seems like the ':' in the date is handled as a placeholder, but only if the query contains "Ö"? Could it be any regex with "a-z" somewhere in the code that mess things up? Maybe Zend\_Db\_Statement::\_prepSql ?

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query() forces all input to pass through PDO's prepare() . However, the example you give have no bound parameters, yet uses colons. If you try using PDO natively, but first pass your SQL string to PDO's prepare(), I expect you will receive the same error.

Thus, either query() needs a mechanism to disable use of prepare(), or the ZF needs a different function to pass SQL code directly to the adapter, or you can use getConnection() to retrieve the PDO object and then directly use the PDO object to execute() your SQL. Frankly, I am not sure what value Zend\_Db\* is providing to you beyond what is already available using PHP's PDO functions directly.

I suppose some will want to dynamically choose a database (e.g. MySQL, SQLite, etc.), and then directly issue portable SQL code against that Zend DB adapter, so we will probably need to provide an alternative to the existing query() in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Patch suggestions are welcomed.

Reformatted description, restated summary.

One workaround could be to use a parameter for the string that contains colon characters:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->query('SELECT * FROM kund WHERE foretag REGEXP ?', array('.*a+[[:space:]]*b.*' ));

In revision 5065, I added logic to the parsing of SQL statements. Parameter placeholders inside quoted strings or delimited identifiers should no longer be noted as parameters.
