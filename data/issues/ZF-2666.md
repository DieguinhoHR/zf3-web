### Description

On a few occasions I had to check if a column was the primary key (with auto-increment) in a table. One of these occasions was when I wanted to automate the creating/updating of a row after a form has been submitted and validated. The identity column needed to be ignored, because a value shouldn't be explicitly set. I ended up writing the following method in a custom Zend\_Db\_Table class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isIdentity($column)
    {
        if (!isset($this->_metadata[$column])) {
            return false;
        }
    
        return (bool) $this->_metadata[$column]['IDENTITY'];
    }


I'd like to see this method added to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract if possible for 1.5 :)

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

It seems that in general ZDTA likes to throw exceptions when a non-existing column is specified. In my own SVN I changed the return false to throw an exception.
