Declare what exactly is your problem.

Which notice is thrown ? What is your ZF version / SVN release ? What is your php version ? Which environment locale ? Which locale has your browser requested ?

Generally thrown notices shall not be omitted, because they show a problem. And your example code shows 2 bugs even without taking in account the line marked as problem which even is not member of Zend\_Locale.

well, i can't reproduce the notice with revision 11362 anymore, so i think it's fixed. sorry for (false) report.

To mention:

You will get problems as soon as your user has set another locale than de\_DE... You create a date with browser settings and compare it with de\_DE settings.
