### Description

With 1.9.0 RC1, a previously (in 1.8.4) correctly handled Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha of type image throws an error message "Invalid type given, value should be float, string, or integer" if the captcha code was entered correctly. When entering an incorrect code, the correct BAD\_CAPTCHA error is thrown. Unfortunately I can't provide a live case here. If necessary, I will try to isolate a test case.

Yes, test case would help a lot.

Please reopen if you have a test case.
