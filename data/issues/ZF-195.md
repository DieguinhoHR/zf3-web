### Description

The ability to specify the Return-path is quite useful, especially when wanting to direct bounces to a different address from the Sender address. From my research and testing the MAIL FROM command in SMTP allows the Return-path to be specifed.

It would be great if there was a way to specify the email address used by the following method in Mail/Transport/Smtp.php.

 
    public function mail_from($from_email)
    {
        $this->_send('MAIL FROM: <'.$from_email.'>');
        $this->_expect(250);
    }


I hardcoded the $from\_email and got the behaviour I was looking for. We really need to have a method that allows this to be set on the fly as individual emails are being sent - maybe something like $mail->setReturnPath()...

Not a blocker, as the mail component can be used without this feature. However, it would be nice to have, and has been slated for the 0.2.0 release.

It should be noted in the final documentation that using an email address in SMTP's MAIL FROM that differs from the mail header "From:" will increase the likelihood that anti-spam systems will file that email into the "junk/spam" folder.

Note that the mail header's "From:" can use any name in combination with an email address identical to whatever is desired for MAIL FROM. For example,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    From:  "My Name" 

Thus, setting a different email address in MAIL FROM than in the "From:" mail header is not considered "best practice", and generally should be discouraged. The "Reply-To:" header solves the issue of someone replying to the bounce address, when the bounce address is using for the "From:" and "MAIL FROM".

Reply-To is a non-standard mail header; Return-Path _is_ standard and addressed in RFC-2821 as the appropriate place to set an alternate address for bouncebacks.

I've updated Zend\_Mail and Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp to in commit 927 in SVN to address this; tests were also written and pass.
