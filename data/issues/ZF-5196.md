pass 'helper' => null example: $captcha = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha( 'captcha', array( 'helper' => null, 'captcha' => array( 'captcha' => 'Image', 'wordLen' => 6, 'timeout' => 300, 'imgDir' => 'img/captcha', 'imgUrl' => '<http://urlpath/img/captcha>', 'width' => 200, 'height' => 60, 'font' => '/absolute/path/to/your/font.ttf' ))); this works for me, but unfortunately this is not the default with the decorator for the captcha element line 89 Zend/Form/Decorator/ViewHelper.php I think

It uses formHidden so it's probably form view helper issue...
