ZF-3185: Allow formating a date on the fly (static method) via Zend\_Date
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Most of the time, you simply want to just format a date for the output, without struggling around with Zend\_Date. Currently you have to do two steps to get that:

$date = new Zend\_Date($myUnformattedDate); echo $date->get(Zend\_Date::DATE\_FULL);

With my patch, you can do that with a single step:

echo Zend\_Date::format($myUnformattedDate, Zend\_Date::DATE\_FULL);

The patch is errorous.

Actually the complete API is object based because it's intention was to be used by date math with fluid interface.

Having same functionality in strict interface could lead to misuse. We will have to look over the cons before we integrate such functionality.

Also WHEN strict functions beside the actual ones are integrated this has to be done for all generic usable functions.

The biggest actual NEG is that the API of Zend\_Date is already very big because of it's simplicity and usability. The original intention was not to add functionality until the minimum requirements have been raised and we are able to use the new date extension which is available since PHP 5.2.0.
