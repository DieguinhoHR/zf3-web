What do you mean with "destroys adapter stuff" ?

And regarding "normal form element"... also the file element is a normal form element.

There is a description of how to add form elements to a form, which has nothing to do with Zend\_File\_Translate. And there is also a description of how a multi-file form element has to be created.

Can you be more descriptive on what you did not find or what you expect ?
