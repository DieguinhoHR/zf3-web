### Description

Element.php, line 2000 {quote}$instance = new $name;{quote}

This way Zenf\_Validator\_Float::\_\_construct gets no locale passed and failes validations for i18n numbers.

No bug of Zend\_Form. Simply give the option when adding the validator:

Example: ```

Form definition stored in INI, and locale stored in registry in Zend\_Locale key.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.set.html#zend.validate.set.float)

says {quote} Since Zend Framework 1.8 this validator takes into account the actual locale from browser, environment or application wide set locale. {quote}

So I expect it to work without any form element manipulations in actions.

No, this feature was reverted with 1.9 as many people had problems with this automatism.

reverting is cool, keep doing this way :)
