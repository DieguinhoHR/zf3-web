### Description

Get error Zend\_Validate\_Exception: No message template exists for key '' when attempting the intuitive approach:

example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validators = array(
        'month' => array(
            'alpha',
            'messages' => 'A month must consist only of letters'
        ),
     'year' => array(
            'digits',
            'messages' => 'A year must consist only of numbers'
        )
    );


Closer reading of the docs suggests that the following works:

example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validators = array(
        'month' => array(
            'alpha'
        ),
     'year' => array(
            'digits'
        ),
     'messages'  => array ( 
             1  =>  'A month must consist only of letters',
             2  =>  'A year must consist only of numbers' 
         )
    );


Also, if this interpretation is correct what approach should one adopt if there is a form field called 'messages'.

Thanks, Ian Lewis

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

This issue is also an issue of Zend\_Filter\_Input as far as i understood it. Recategorized.

This is more a problem of the bad API of complex Zend\_Filter\_Input objects.

The solution to this problem is more of a documentation issue (of the bad API). Changes are only possible for 2.0

I just tested this...

Actually both approaches are usable. Within the testbed the following is checked and works:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $validators = array(
                'name' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter your name'),
                'subject' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter a subject'),
                'email' => array('EmailAddress','messages' => 'Please enter a valid Email address'),
                'content' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter message contents')
            );

Seems to be fixed with one of the previous commits. Therefor closing this issue as fixed with the next minor release.
