ZF-6097: For settings no arrays are accepted, only instances of Zend\_Config

### Description

At the moment only instances of Zend\_Config are allowed in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite::addConfig(). It would be appreciated if arrays were accepted too. (there seems no obvious reason to only zend\_config's).

No, addRoutes() only takes an array of route instances. Making the router to actually support arrays is not easy, as all routes only take Zend\_Config objects in the getInstance() method.
