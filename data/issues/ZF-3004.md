### Description

When using the Zend\_Filter\_Input component it is usually in preparation for database insert/update queries. Sometimes it is necessary to pass a NULL value in such a query (for example, to reset a previously set field that is NULL by default). Unfortunately the default escaper, htmlentities, converts NULL values into empty strings which prevents such data from passing a Zend\_Filter\_Input process.

This could be seen as a PHP bug (why is null converted to empty string?) but as it stands it should be possible to pass null values through a Zend\_Filter\_Input.

I've created a temporary patch in my local build of the framework (1.5.1)

Zend\_Filter\_Input.php, line 349:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _escapeRecursive($data)
        {
            if(is_null($data)){
                return $data;
            }
         ....
         }
