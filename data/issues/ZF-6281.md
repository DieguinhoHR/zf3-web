ZF-6281: Zend\_Dom\_Query::\_getNodeList() mishandles query arrays
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Dom\_Query::query() calls Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XPath::transform(), which can return an array. It passes this as $xpathQuery to Zend\_Dom\_Query::queryXPath(), which passes it to Zend\_Dom\_Query::\_getNodeList(). According to the docblock for this method, $xpathQuery may be a string or an array. However, this method explicitly casts $xpathQuery to a string, which results in that variable being equal to the string "Array" if the original value for $xpathQuery is an array.

In my opinion, it would be best for the sake of consistency to restrict $xpathQuery to be a string for both queryXPath() and \_getNodeList() and to modify Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XPath::transform() so that it only ever returns a string.

Is it still alive after ZF-6280 fix?

Yes, this issue is still applicable. ZF-6280 only corrected API docblocks. This deals with corresponding source code. The reason that the two issues are related is because the fix from ZF-6280 (updating the API docblocks to reflect that the parameter/return types could be string or array) affects how this issue should be handled.

If both strings and arrays are to be allowed, line 207 of Zend/Dom/Query.php in trunk (in \_getNodeList() where $xpathQuery is typecasted to a string) needs to be modified to handle actually allowing arrays rather than assigning the string 'Array' to $xpathQuery.

As a side note, it seems odd that \_getNodeList() is even separated from queryXpath(), as the latter is the only thing that calls the former.

I've resolved this issue on my end (ZF version 1.9.3) by using the following line in Css2Xpath.php (line 52)

return implode(' | ', $expressions);

instead of

return $expressions;
