ZF-521: Zend\_Http\_Request::setRequestUri(uri\_with\_query\_string) could be improved

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Request::setRequestUri() doesn't parses query strings as PHP does, if parameter names contain square brackets [] and/or other separators than ampersands &. i.e.:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ?foo[]=bar;foo[]=baz


PHP's function parse\_str() neither ignores []s nor arg\_separator.input.

The URI is currently parsed using string functions, but this could be done using parse\_url().

I need to browse the PHP manual every now and again it seems -- thanks for pointing out parse\_url and parse\_str.
