### Description

I'm finding that Zend Framework fails silently somehow when I have a syntax error in my model files. Specifically (although I don't think this is relevant), in my classes extending Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract.

I think I've tracked this down to Zend\_Loader::loadclass.

I find that my PHPUnit tests crash (i.e. back to command prompt with no errors), my webpages are returned blank (with no errors), and there's nothing in the logs I've got all errors being reported.

It makes life a little tricky when debugging sometimes!

Sorry about that! Issue duplicated and apparently fixed in 1.8.

This has been resolved since 1.8. Zend\_Loader::loadClass() no longer uses a suppression operator prior to the include() call, allowing parse errors to be reported.
