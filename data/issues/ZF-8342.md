ZF-8342: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select addMultiOption method fails to render labels/options containing £

### Description

I have some multioptions (which are monetary values), If I add elements like so:

$prices = array([0]=>'20000'........etc

foreach ($prices as $price) {

$minprice->addMultiOption($price,'£'.number\_format($price));

}

The select box comes out with the correct amount of options, with the values set, but nothing between the tags and nothing on the label attribute.

Please supply code to reproduce.

Ignoring the encoding issue, the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $minprice = new Zend_Form_Element_Select('minprice');
    $prices = array(0 => '20000');
    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        $minprice->addMultiOption($price,'£'.number_format($price));
    }
    $minprice->setView(new Zend_View());
    echo $minprice->render();


...produces:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     
    
    Â£20,000

Form extends Zend\_Form in the usual manner (as per the quickstart)

In the init() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $minprice = $this->createElement('select','MinPrice');
            $minprice->setLabel('Minimum Price')
                     ->addMultiOption('0','No Preference');
            $maxprice = $this->createElement('select','MaxPrice');
            $maxprice->setLabel('Maximum Price')
                     ->addMultiOption('0','No Preference');
            foreach ($this->_settings['pricerange'] as $price) {
                $minprice->addMultiOption($price,'£'.number_format($price));
                $maxprice->addMultiOption($price,'£'.number_format($price));
            }


Which produces:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Minimum Price
    
    No Preference
    Maximum Price
    
    No Preference


$this->\_settings['pricerange'] array is set from application.ini via a bootstrap method, storing them in the registry.

View is set as follows (incase that helps):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');
    $view->doctype('XHTML11');  


Simply omitting the £ the option label etc are set correctly.

I've added a test case for this, and, quite simply, am unable to reproduce the issue. Most likely, it's a problem related to encoding of the script and/or your web server.

As per your suggestion about encoding, removing $view->setEncoding('UTF-8'); from my bootstrap gets this a step further, but results in:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    No Preference�50,000�100,000�125,000�150,000�175,000�200,000�250,000�300,000�400,000�500,000�750,000�1,000,000�2,000,000�5,000,000

View is set up as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _initDoctype()
        {
            $this->bootstrap('view');
            $view = $this->getResource('view');
            $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');
            $view->doctype('XHTML11');  
        }


The app follows almost to a T the quick start (in terms of structure, the default layout etc), can you give me any pointers in order to get this resolved?

Thanks

Just incase someone else comes across this, I found the cause of the problem outlined above, which as rightly said by Matthew Weier O'Phinney isnt a bug in ZF after all...

The issue is caused by Zend Studio For Eclipse, when run on a mac it defaults to using a mac-roman character set, this is the sole reason seemingly valid code was producing this problem, converting the scripts in question to UTF-8 corrects this problem
