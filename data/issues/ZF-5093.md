Our minimum supported PHP version is currently 5.2.4.

The page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html) is not corresponding to this. It's possible to have a table of corresponding Zend Framework version with the minimum version of PHP for each ?

It's a requirement for some development environment like mine.

Unfortunately, the requirements page was not updated in time for the 1.7.0 release; it will be updated with the 1.7.1 release.

I think your idea for a table is a good one. However, it would currently look like this: < 1.7.0 == PHP 5.1.4; >= 1.7.0 == 5.2.4.

OK for the page requirements : <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5054>

This bug started with Zend Form, it means the version of PHP is 5.2.4 in ZF-1.5.0 ?

No, 1.5.0 required 5.1.4. You marked this issue as 1.7.0, which was why I responded as I did. Regardless, I cannot reproduce with current versions of ZF or PHP.
