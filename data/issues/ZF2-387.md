### Description

I have a module, EdpMarkdown, which includes the PHP Markdown library (<http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>) as a submodule. I went to generate a classmap for my module, however it only detected the first class in PHP Markdown's markdown.php file. This library does not follow PSR-0 or anything similar; it's simply a php file with a bunch of constants, classes, and functions in it.
