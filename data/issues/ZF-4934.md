These tests are taking a really long time in multiple environments, Christoph. Like >15min apeice. :O

I am not in a position to troubleshoot this until mid December. Sorry.

I believe the problem has to do with the is\_resource() call I recently committed.

OK, no worries. I'm taking a look at it now, and I'll start by checking out is\_resource().

Maybe we can cast the object to string and check for the "Resource #" string as the last IF check.

1. Using '===' is enough to perform check if it's the same object really quickly. It actually compares only object ID's
2. The problem is actualy in a _really HUGE_ data structure passed to the logger.

While tracing it includes Upper level of PHPUnit objects + all ZF test case objects including their properties (additional objects using during testing)! It's large enough structure even Zend\_Log\_Writer\_FirebugTest test case is started separately (takes ~25sec), but it becomes too large if whole ZF tests suite is started.

I'm going to mark testAdvancedLogging(Zend\_Log\_Writer\_FirebugTest) as skipped since it passes without problems in a separate mode.

See r12606 and r12607.

Christoph, do you have any time to look at this now?

 

 

Posted by Christoph Dorn (cadorn) on 2008-12-18T14:23:40.000+0000

I'll get this fixed soon.

 

 

Posted by Christoph Dorn (cadorn) on 2009-01-13T18:01:40.000+0000

Should be fixed now. I am limiting the stack trace with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Wildfire_Plugin_FirePhp::getInstance()->setOption('maxTraceDepth',0);
