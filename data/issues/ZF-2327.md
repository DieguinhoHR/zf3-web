### Description

The Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request\_Http construct is missing the method and params arguments. If you extend the Http class and then try to assign the method through the constructor, it doesn't get assigned to the internal \_method property, though it does in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request.

This is by design. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request\_Http is designed to answer to incoming HTTP requests. Its constructor pulls XML from <a>php://input</a> and passes it to loadXml() -- which is when the method and params will be set.

If you don't want this behavior, then extend the Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request class, or have your extending class accept the method and params and set them itself.
