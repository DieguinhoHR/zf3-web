ZF-1337: Zend\_Session\_Namespace does not load its dependencies
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When trying to load Zend\_Session\_Namespace without loading Zend\_Session\_Abstract first, a fatal error is thrown because Zend\_Session\_Abstract is not defined.

This can be easily fixed by adding the proper require\_once line in Zend/Session/Namespace.php

A fix patch is attached.
