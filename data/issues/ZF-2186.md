### Description

This error occured on Both Windows and Linux OS. I set the TestConfiguration.php to run tests on pdo\_ibm and ibm\_db2. When I ran Alltests.php I've received the error:

{quote} PHP Fatal error: require\_once(): Failed opening required 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Ibm/Db2.php' (include\_path='/usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/tests:/usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library:.:/usr/local/Zend/Core/share/pear:/usr/local/PHPUnit-3.1.9:/usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library') in /usr/local/Zend/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Ibm.php on line 28 {quote}

I received a similar error for the file _Pdo/Ibm/Ids.php_

Both of these files as well as the Ibm directory were missing in ZendFramework 1.02 that comes with ZendCore 2.5.0. Therefore I can't test connection to IBM DB2 in the ZendFramework unitesting.

Bookkeeping. Assigning closed and resolved issues to those who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
