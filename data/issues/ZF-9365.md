@Martin: Within the fw-docs list we spoke about the resource files, not about the manual itself.

The resource files are pre-translated resources for all messages which are returned by Zend\_Validate. Therefor the usage of Zend Validate as assigned component.

When you want to translate the documentation then you need to have svn rights.

Sorry, but there is no way how I could give you access to svn. These rights are given by Zend.
