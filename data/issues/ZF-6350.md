### Description

Every second or thrid page reload, the javascript fails. In FireFox error console, the error is reported as zend is undefined.

I seem to have eliminated the error by switching to declarative mode by calling

Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo::setUseDeclarative();

in by bootstrap.php. Since switchng to declarative mode I have reloaded 20 times and not gotten the error.

I can't reproduce this, honestly, and I use both declarative and programmatic regularly.
