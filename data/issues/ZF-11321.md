Where did you exactly download the zend framework from, and what version?

I cloned zf2 from github.

It's not an issue. The new location for zf2 is resources/cldr/. Thomas Weidner began to refactor \\Zend\\Locale.

Please note the Zend\_Locale is actually refactored within ZF2. The CLDR files are no longer integrated within the ZF library and are instead only optional available and needed.

Therefor this issue is being closed as non-issue.
