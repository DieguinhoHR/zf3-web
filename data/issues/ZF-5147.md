ZF-5147: partialLoop counter does not reset between calls
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The partialLoop counter remembers its position between calls to the partialLoop helper. This is undesired, as separate calls to the partialLoop represent essentially separate loops, with unrelated counters.

Fixed with [r13031](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=13031).

Any chance of getting this backported to 1.7.x ?

It is a pretty annoying bug if you are trying to treat the first element differently.

It will be release in 1.7.2 when ever that gets released.
