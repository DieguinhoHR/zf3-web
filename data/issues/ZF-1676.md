ZF-1676: leading zeros in comparison of chunk size
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-07-03T09:22:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:25.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Some servers prepend the chunk size with zeros. And that throws exceptions like... {quote} Invalid chunk size "00001d27" unable to read chunked body {quote}

Thats because:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    $line = "00001D27";
    $hexchunksize = chop($line);
    $hexchunksize = strlen($hexchunksize) ? strtolower($hexchunksize) : 0;
    $chunksize = hexdec(chop($line));
    
    print $hexchunksize."\n"; // = "00001d27"
    print dechex($chunksize)."\n"; // = "1d27"
    ?>

Here's what I changed to make it working smooth...

 
    <pre class="highlight">

Thank's for the patch - resolved in r. 5569. Let me know if the problem persists, as this is very hard to test.
