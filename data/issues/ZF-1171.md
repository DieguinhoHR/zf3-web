### Description

With HTTP authentication, it doesn't make a lot of sense to store the Auth Result in the session, since the process must always be done again on each request. A new Storage class should be provided that does not attempt to persist the Auth results across requests. Using this NonPersistent Storage class would allow a usage pattern consistent with the other Auth adapters, without the overhead of unnecessary session storage.
