### Description

Zend\_Pdf did not allow image creation from a remote source, I.E. HTTP. Unfortunately for dynamic image parsing from the web, we needed this functionality

A simple fix for us was to modify PDF/Resource Class Zend\_Pdf\_Resource\_ImageFactory::factory

below our fix
-------------

class Zend\_Pdf\_Resource\_ImageFactory { public static function factory($filename) { // Oscars check remote file here.., read one char in to minimize traffic if((!is\_file($filename) ) && ( file\_get\_contents( $filename, NULL, NULL, 0, 1) === false)) { require\_once 'Zend/Pdf/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Pdf\_Exception("Cannot create image resource. File not found local or remote.");

 }

If this could be added in the next release we would be very grateful.

Best Regards, Oscar Frowijn Ozkat Technologies
