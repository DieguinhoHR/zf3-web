### Description

With the example below, only the datas of the last loaded file is kept in the adapter because, during loading the file the array \_translate is always reset.

$translate = new Zend\_Translate('xliff', APP\_PATH."/language/fr");

I think that line below (on Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Xliff) must be executed only if the "clear" option is set to true. 125 $this->\_translate[$this->\_source] = array(); 126 $this->\_translate[$this->\_target] = array();

Why should someone load the same translation file twice but with changed content ?

In our application, we use Zend\_Translate with scanning directory option.

Example : My directory APP\_PATH."/language/fr" have 4 files : - common.xliff (for all common translation like hello, date ...) - form.xliff (for all Zend\_Validate message) - index.xliff (for my Index controller message) - test.xliff (for my Test controller message

When i make : $translate = new Zend\_Translate('xliff', APP\_PATH."/language/fr");

I expect that $translate contains datas of all my xliff files instead of the last loaded files (test.xliff).

that's why I think that line below (on Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Xliff) must be executed only if the "clear" option is set to true. 125 $this->\_translate[$this->\_source] = array(); 126 $this->\_translate[$this->\_target] = array();

I see no problem.

The looked at the code you are referring to but it does not exist in trunk. So the related issue can not occur in the next release.

I think we can resolve this issue as it was already addressed before.
