### Description

Sorry it may won't be inside the good category but I found a problem inside the website. Some urls are bad redirect, you could try when you look for Zend\_Validate with the search engine, links are bad redirect.

I created this tickets with major priority because I don't know if this is just a bug or an attack.

Which urls? I have searched for Zend\_Validate and they seem fine to me.

I search Zend\_Validate on google and when I click links inside the Zend Documentation I found a url like this [http://framework.zend.com/manual/fr/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/fr/zend.validate.html/zend.validate.set.html)

I can confirm this for forms too...

A Google search on forms points me to: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.html/)

Clicking the third page on that list "Creating Form Elements Using Zend\_Form\_Element" points met to [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.html/zend.form.elements.html) ... and that page look exacly like <http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/>

OT: Thumbs up for everyone working on ZF!

The issue was related to the old website.
