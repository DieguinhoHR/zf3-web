### Description

Here is my sql request:

$select = $this->select(); $select->union(array($select1, $select2)); $select->order('edge2edge\_id'); $select->group('edge2edge\_id'); $select->group('module'); $select->group('aspen\_connection\_id'); $select->having('SUM(nbPaths) >= ?', $nbPaths);

echo $select->assemble(); => SELECT ... UNION ... ORDER BY edge2edge\_id !

All other clauses after orderBy (groupBy and having clauses) are skipped !

Can you please provide a sample reproduction case. This would include schema, platform information, and a script that demonstrates the problem.

See [http://ralphschindler.com/2010/02/â€¦](http://ralphschindler.com/2010/02/18/the-anatomy-of-a-bug-issue-reproduction-script)

Thanks for the report. -ralph

I've also encountered this. Here is my test case

$select = new Zend\_Db\_Select($adapter);

$select1 = "SELECT \* FROM `table1`"; $select2 = "SELECT \* FROM `table2`";

$select->union(array($select1, $select2)); $select->group('last'); $select->having(new Zend\_Db\_Expr('count(\*) > 1'));

//expected output //SELECT \* FROM `table1` UNION SELECT \* FROM `table2` GROUP BY last HAVING count(\*) > 1 ORDER BY `last` ASC, `first` ASC LIMIT 40

//outputs //SELECT \* FROM `table1` UNION SELECT \* FROM `table2` ORDER BY `last` ASC, `first` ASC LIMIT 40

The problem is the \_renderHaving and \_renderGroup are checking for a self::FROM part which wont exist with a union. My suggestion is to only check for a self::FROM part if it isn't a union.
