### Description

In attempting to switch from AMFPHP to Zend\_Amf, I ran across the following issue:

The AMF3 encoding doesn't seem to be correct for ByteArray instances. When returning a Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray instance, the serializer attempts to pass the instance to its writeString method, which attempts to treat it as a simple string, causing php to send the incorrect data as well as emit a notice as follows:

bq. Notice: Object of class Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray to string conversion

One way to avoid this and properly return the binary data to the server is to modify line 81 of Zend\\Amf\\Parse\\Amf3\\Serializer.php to read:

bq. $this->writeString($data instanceof Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray ? $data->getData() : $data);

Hi Wade,

This issue is not fixed in the minimal framework version 1.7.3 that I am using. The fix noted above (from the earlier issue) seems to work well though.

Caspar.

I am not sure what version this was resolved in but I know that it is in the ZF 1.7.8 release. Thanks!
