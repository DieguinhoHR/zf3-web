### Description

_Summary:_ Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_OriginalEvent does not include support for Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_When as a child element.

_Steps to Reproduce:_ 1. Create a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_OriginalEvent using the following XML snippet:

 
    <pre class="literal"><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>


_Expected Results:_ The when element should be converted to a first-class Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_When property of the original Zned\_Gdata\_Extension\_OriginalEvent instance.

_Actual Results:_ The when element is instead converted to an extension element.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r4878, affects 1.0.0 RC1 and RC2.

_Notes:_ Patch sent to rboyd for review.

This should have been detected by the existing unit tests. I'm investigating to see how this went unnoticed.

The reason issue ZF-1591 was not detected was because existing unit tests are only testing against _empty_ instances to make sure that there are no extension attributes/elements. Issue ZF-1592 created to correct this.
