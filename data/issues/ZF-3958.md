ZF-3958: Wrong call for new SoapFault in Zend\_Soap\_Server::fault() breaks SOAP exception handling
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-15T06:22:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-13T14:10:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.0 (17/Nov/08)

### Description

SoapFault expects the code parameter being a string instead of an integer. If code is an integer, the SoapException reports an internal server error instead of the correct one.

The correct call has to be:

return new SoapFault( (string) $code, message );

You're correct, line 799 of server.php needs to have (string) to works correctly. Now I can register Exception and use it in the handled class. Thanks.

Shouldn't this be considered high priority? It effectively breaks exception handling, as Exception->getCode() is always is an integer.

This is the patch. I'm not sure if it is the correct format. Please give feedback.
