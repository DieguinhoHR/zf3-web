ZF-8296: createRow leads to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract init method call prior to row data being set

### Description

If you call createRow() from a table instance the order of execution inside that method means that the row is instantiated with no data, which calls the rows' init() method. I can certainly see using the row data in the init method (as my case brought to light). Simply setting the config['data'] property prior to instantiating the row object solves this problem.

OLD CODE: (starts at line 1440 of Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php) $config = array( 'table' => $this, 'data' => $defaults, 'readOnly' => false, 'stored' => false );

 
        if (!class_exists($this->_rowClass)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
            Zend_Loader::loadClass($this->_rowClass);
        }
        $row = new $this->_rowClass($config);
        $row->setFromArray($data);
        return $row;


NEW (FIXED) CODE: foreach($defaults as $k => $v) { if(array\_key\_exists($k, $data)) $defaults[$k] = $data[$k]; }

 
        $config = array(
            'table'    => $this,
            'data'     => $defaults,
            'readOnly' => false,
            'stored'   => false
        );
    
        $rowClass = $this->getRowClass();
        if (!class_exists($rowClass)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
            Zend_Loader::loadClass($rowClass);
        }
        $row = new $rowClass($config);
        return $row;


The only change I made was to ensure that any data set in the incoming data array got inserted into the data of the row prior to it's initialization and subsequent init() method call. I first noticed this issue in 1.9.0, but it probably existed prior to that. I did make sure that the issue persisted through 1.9.5.

This is by design. createRow() is creating an un-attached row object, $data is then used to populate the row object after it has been created. This is why at the end of createRow() you see setFromArray($data).

If you are using the same Row type as with a rowset, init() can be sure that the values in the row object have come from the database. With createRow() they will not be there b/c the row is not yet stored.

I am closing this as not-an-issue, but perhaps you want to open a feature request. Or discuss what you are attempting to do on the mailing list.
