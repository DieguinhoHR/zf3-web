### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::\_\_toString wraps the sendResponse() method in an output buffer, giving the impression that it is returning the entire response as a string. However, sendResponse() calls sendHeaders() internally, which in turn uses header() which is exempt from output buffering; the headers bypass the buffer and get sent immediately. Calling \_\_toString() thus produces both an unwanted side effect and an incomplete result. The implementation should probably compile the headers into a string itself and avoid relying on PHP's awkward header() function at all.
