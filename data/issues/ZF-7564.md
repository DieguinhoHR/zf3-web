### Description

The following test fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyTest extends Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase
    {
        public function testFoo()
        {
            $this->dispatch('/');
            $this->assertQuery('form#foo');
        }
    }


when requested document begins with XML declaration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>


and passes if there is no such declaration.

What is more interesing

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assertQuery('#foo');


passes. Same applies to corresponding XPath queries (CSS queries are translated into XPath queries):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assertXpath('//form[@id="foo"]');


fails, but the following passes

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assertXpath('//*[@id="foo"]');

Could you maybe investigate if this is a problem with Zend\_Dom\_Query instead?

Yes, the bug itself is in Zend\_Dom\_Query component, but since Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit is using it, both components are affected. Anyway, the query component should be fixed.

I've tried a number of documents with the XML declaration, and in all cases, the queries you specified worked fine -- both the CSS selector and XPath queries.

If you can provide sample content and queries that fail, please re-open this issue or open a new one.
