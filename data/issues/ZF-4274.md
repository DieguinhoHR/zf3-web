### Description

Zend\_Dojo\_Form checkbox generates incorrect HTML. Assuming a working Zend\_Dojo environment, the following code produces the error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    
    
        function indexAction () {
            
            $this->view->addHelperPath('Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/', 'Zend_Dojo_View_Helper');
            $form = new Zend_Dojo_Form();
            $form->addElement(
                'CheckBox', 
                'checkboxValue', 
                array(
                    'label'        => 'Label',
                    'checkedValue' => 'checkedValue',
                'uncheckedValue' => 'notCheckedValue',
                )
            );
    
            $form->addDecorators(array('FormElements', 'Form'));
            $this->view->form = $form;
        }
    }


This produces the following HTML:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


The correct HTML should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Tested against SVN Trunk r 11380.

This is the wrong fix, but it is a fix. The problem is that the $checkedOptions parameter is not set when passed to the Helper.

This component is unusable in it's actual state... It don't work at all !

In addition, the view helper adds ``` even if the form element value is set to the unChecked value. I assume this is so because the value of the hidden field differs from the unchecked value, because of which it is incorrectly assumed that the field should thus be checked.

The problem was the options set in FormCheckbox.php were left unused.

We merge with existing options, because options may already be in use by multioptions.

This is a risk, so we must further test if this wil work with a checkbox group that has multioptions.

This code is added in DijitElement::render():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if(array_key_exists('options', $attribs)){
                if(is_array($options)){
                    $options = array_merge($options, $attribs['options']);
                }else{
                    $options = $attribs['options'];
                }
            }

trying to overwrite wrong patch file (is whole file instead of patch)

Patch for tests/Zend/Dojo/Form/Element/CheckboxTest.php

Do not use the last patch in the list (the oldest). It is the whole file (sorry). It's size is 6kb, you should use the 2kb version that is listed one higher up.

Please review. I think it is quite allright, but you should take a look at how checkboxgroups behave in Dojo after patching. I should write a test for that myself, but I need to get some sleep.

Found that the test patch and the dijit patch are the same: they both are the testpatch. So I try once again and upload the decorator/DijitElement.php patch.

better batch, leaves multioptions intact instead of doubling them by using array\_merge

Better patch (number 4) deletes the lines where getMultiOptions() is called internally. This line is no longer necessary and existing tests still pass.

Also a manual test proved that these lines were no longer needed.

Committed to svn after contacting Matthew about this and resolving the conflict with multioptions.

 

 

Posted by Bart McLeod (mcleod@spaceweb.nl) on 2008-11-18T06:18:09.000+0000

affects version 1.7 and prior.
