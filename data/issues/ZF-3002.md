### Description

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server sends HTTP header Content-Type: application/xml, but in <a href="">www.xmlrpc.com/spec</a>" rel="nofollow">XML-RPC spec I see responce example with Content-Type: text/xml. So, Zend XML-RPC client is not compatible with XML-RPC spec. Moreover it dosn't work with some XML-RPC clients (Ruby XML-RPC for example).

P.S.: Issue from nabble.com [http://nabble.com/question-about-Zend\_XmlRpc\_Serveâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/question-about-Zend_XmlRpc_Server-and-responce-Content-type-to16395307.html)
