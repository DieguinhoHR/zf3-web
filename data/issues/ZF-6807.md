ZF-6807: Pretty-print for HTML view helpers
-------------------------------------------

### Description

The indentation code from Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract should go to Zend\_View\_Helper\_HtmlElement. This would enable all HTML-generating helpers to produce beautiful code. :) This could be done with levels, say you setInitialIndentLevel(2) and then call $this->\_getWhitespace(3) inside your helper, this would return str\_repeat($indentString, 5).

I know this seems a non-issue but some people really pay attention to these sorts of things, my boss among them. :) The pretty-print behaviour could also be on/off.
