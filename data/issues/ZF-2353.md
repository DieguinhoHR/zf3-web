ZF-2353: Default view script path returns in spite of setScriptPath()
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I'm injecting my prepared view instance to the ViewRenderer in the bootsrap. I try to reset the view script path to my own via setScriptPath(), however during dispatch the dafault script path returns to the stack as the first entry.

Reproduction:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once('library/Zend/Loader.php');
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->setControllerDirectory('controllers');
    
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->setScriptPath('views/anything');
    Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('ViewRenderer')->setView($view);
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($view->getScriptPaths());
    
    $frontController->dispatch();
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($view->getScriptPaths());

Can you give the debug output as you receive it, so I can better diagnose? I'm really not sure what the issue is; it may be intended behaviour, it may not, but I need to see that output, as well as a better description of what you expect the behaviour to be.

Sorry for the delay. Here's the output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(1) {
      [0] => string(15) "views/anything/"
    }
    
    Caught exception: script 'index/index.phtml' not found in path (Test/views/scripts/:views/anything/)
    
    array(2) {
      [0] => string(19) "Test/views/scripts/"
      [1] => string(15) "views/anything/"
    }

The behavior you present is the expected and designed behavior. Paths in Zend\_View are done as a LIFO stack, and new paths added are placed at the top of the stack. If a script is not found in one path, the next path is searched.

If you want or need different behavior, please extend Zend\_View to provide it.

But the new path is not added but set (setScriptPath())! It should delete all the previously set paths, shouldn't it?

The ViewRenderer calls addBasePath(), not setScriptPath().
