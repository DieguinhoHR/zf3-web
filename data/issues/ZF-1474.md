### Description

Although automatically quoting SQL identifiers makes usage of Zend\_Db most flexible when SQL identifiers might contain special characters or SQL reserved words, it has the unwanted side effect that SQL identifiers become case-sensitive.

This causes difficulty in the cases of IBM DB2 and Oracle, which map unquoted identifiers to uppercase instead of truly doing case-insensitive matching. That is, when one does CREATE TABLE to define table names and column names, the unquoted identifiers are mapped to uppercase and stored that way. Subsequently, running queries with quoted lowercase identifiers fails to match the identifiers in the schema.

So this is a feature request to make it a configurable option in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract to turn off the automatic quoting functionality.

It should remain the default that adapters quote everything they can.

I suggest the option name 'quoteIdentifiers' in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. The default should be true.

Please review the new property defined in the Zend\_Db component. At object construction, the property is set. If true, all identifiers are automatically quoted. If false, they are not. The default is true.

most changes are made here in the abstract class. The API quoteIdentifierAutomatically() is defined here. Every call to quoteIdentifier() calls this new API. If the call is made internally, a check of the property \_alwaysQuoteIdentifiers is done. if true, the identifier is quoted, otherwise it is left alone. Some other methods had some api changes made as well to support the new API. An external call to quoteIdentifier() behaves as previously, the identifier is quoted. Files changed include lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php lib/Zend/Db/Adapter/Db2.php

constant ALWAYS\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS is defined here Zend/Db.php

new API had to be called here lib/Zend/Db/Select.php lib/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php lib/Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php

unit tests added (at the end of the file). These show how the configuration property can be used. There are no other changes to external APIs. tests/Zend/Db/Adapter/TestCommon.php

Thanks very much for the patch and doing the work, Salvador. I have updated it a little bit and I committed it with support and tests for all the Zend\_Db adapters.

I made the following functional changes relative to your patch: - Zend\_Db::AUTO\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS is the name of the const naming the option - No need to make a new function quoteIdentifierAutomatically(). Instead, I added an optional param to the usual quoteIdentifier() method. If the second parameter is true, the method uses the current setting of the autoQuoteIdentifer config. Otherwise the parameter defaults to false and it means to explicitly return a quoted identifier. - Restructured unit tests to utilize the adapter's TestUtil class.

I need support to deactivate auto qoting if the configuration option Zend\_Db::AUTO\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS is set to true.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // current
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column');   // `my`.`table`.`as`.`column`
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column', true);   // `my`.`table`.`as`.`column`
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column', false);   // `my`.`table`.`as`.`column`
    
    // need
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column');   // `my`.`table`.`as`.`column`
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column', true);   // `my`.`table`.`as`.`column`
    $mysql->quoteIdentifier('my.table.as.column', false);   // `my.table.as.column`


set the default value of the second argment in quoteIdentifier to NULL if $auto === null then use Zend\_Db::AUTO\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS else use the $auto
