ZF-10506: Zend\_Http\_Cookie::matchCookieDomain() has unescaped preg\_match() call
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The method matchCookieDomain() of the Zend\_Http\_Cookie object has a preg\_match() function call, with unescaped input to that call.

When the method gets _"/"_ as $cookieDomain parameter, preg\_match() generates following error:

{quote} preg\_match(): Unknown modifier '$' {quote}

Current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Check for either exact match or suffix match
    return ($cookieDomain == $host ||
         preg_match("/\.$cookieDomain$/", $host));


Proposed fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Check for either exact match or suffix match
    return ($cookieDomain == $host ||
         preg_match("/\.".preg_quote($cookieDomain, '/')."$/", $host));

Not sure why there would be a slash in a domain as in your example. But, you do raise a valid concern about the missing escaping.

The bigger issue here is that false positives can occur due to an unescaped $cookieDomain being used in the preg\_match() because a dot "." in preg\_match indicates "match any character".

Patch with unit test is attached.
