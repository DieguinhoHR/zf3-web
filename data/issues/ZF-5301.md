ZF-5301: Setting $viewSuffix in Zend\_Controller\_Action: Value Does Not Propagate to ViewRenderer Helper or View

### Description

It looks to me like $viewSuffix was intended to propagate to the viewRenderer helper in Zend\_Controller\_Action. So if I try something like :

$this->viewSuffix = '.fancy.extension.for.views';

...it doesn't change the default setting in the view, and the code comments (in 1.6) indicate to me that the viewSuffix option was supposed to be passed on to the viewRenderer constructor. Maybe there's just a line missing in Zend\_Controller\_Action::initView() (something like $this->\_helper->setViewSuffix($this->viewSuffix))?

It may just be a behavior that I'm misunderstanding, but it seemed odd.

Hello, first comment here, let's see :)

I had the same problem, trying to change the property didn't probagate to the renderer. This is how i did it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    $viewRenderer = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('viewRenderer');
    $viewRenderer->setViewSuffix('php');
    unset($viewRenderer);
    ...


if necessary one can change the suffix in the Controllers by using

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setViewSuffix('php');


Have fun!

Still present in 1.9.7. Is think this should be fixed.

But so long, thanks for the workaround, Michael.

That was my impression, too, but apparently it's the other way around...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    498:        // Register view with action controller (unless already registered)
    499:        if ((null !== $this->_actionController) && (null === $this->_actionController->view)) {
    500:            $this->_actionController->view       = $this->view;
    501:            $this->_actionController->viewSuffix = $this->_viewSuffix;
    502:        }


Line #501 explicitly sets the action controller's $viewSuffix property to that of the ViewRenderer's $\_viewSuffix property. So any change to the $viewSuffix property within the controller gets overwritten by the ViewRenderer.
