### Description

Hello,

the character set in the Content-type header of MIME message part should not be quoted.

Content-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8"

should be replaced with:

Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

As quotes are not neccessary, albeit allowed, they may cause problems to clients/MTA that do not support them correctly. All major webmail service providers are using the unquoted style, so I don't really see, why we shouldn't follow them.

RFC2045 describing the format of Content-Type header <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-5.1>

Affected code of Zend Framework File: Zend/Mime/Part.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getHeadersArray($EOL = Zend_Mime::LINEEND)
    {
            $headers = array();
    
            $contentType = $this->type;
            if ($this->charset) {
    -            $contentType .= '; charset="' . $this->charset . '"';
    +            $contentType .= '; charset=' . $this->charset;
            }


With regards, Ludek Stepan
