### Description

Currently, the Blogger.php sample for Zend\_Gdata lists the following as usage:

 
    php Blogger.php -- --user=[username] --pass=[password]


The extra -- is extraneous and doesn't follow Unix conventions, so should be removed:

 
    php Blogger.php --user=[username] --pass=[password]

I have a changelist waiting on my server to fix this, pending resolution of CLA issues.
