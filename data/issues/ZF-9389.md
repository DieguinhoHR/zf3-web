ZF-9389: Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress: error message not set when 'mx' option is enabled
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The error message is not set when 'mx' is true. More specifically, in Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress::\_validateMXRecords Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress::\_error is never called when getmxrr returns false (i.e. when the domain has no mx entry), thus, although the validation fails no error message is set.
