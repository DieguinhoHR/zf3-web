### Description

I dont understand why isValid method should only accept primitive types (string, float, integer), therefore refuses to validate class instances, even if the class has \_\_toString() method implemented. For example I want validate Zend\_Date instance and have to pass $date->\_\_toString() instead.

The only type which should not be accepted is array, but IMHO this type of parameter checking is useless and only confusing.
