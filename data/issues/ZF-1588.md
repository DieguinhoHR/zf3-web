### Description

The developer documentation is not very clear as to what actions here do _not_ require a CLA.

Perhaps this should be added to the FAQ at [Wiki:ZFPROP/Contributor Licence Agreement](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)?

In general we use this issue tracker for technology or documentation issues with the Zend Framework product itself, not process or website issues. I'm resolving this issue as "not an issue" instead of "fixed" only because I don't want the issue to show up in the release notes for the next ZF release.

I've added this paragraph to the CLA wiki page:

"We welcome reports of issues or feature requests in our issue tracker, and we welcome participation and questions on the mailing lists. You can also publish articles and code on DevZone or on your own blog or website, but anything that constitutes intellectual property cannot be included in Zend Framework unless it is contributed under the terms of the CLA."

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
