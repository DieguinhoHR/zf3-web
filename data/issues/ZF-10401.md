ZF-10401: Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::setZfPath leads to already declared classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This is what happens :

I call require\_once "include\_path\_to\_latest\_ZF/Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php", which internally calls require\_once "include\_path\_to\_latest\_ZF/Zend/Loader.php"

I instanciate the autoloader and call setZfPath("path\_to\_older\_ZF"), which internally prepends "path\_to\_older\_ZF" to the php include\_path.

And then, every require\_once called on previously required classes fail with "Cannot redeclare class \*", because the include\_path to ZF has changed !

Did I miss something on using this "ZF version choice" feature of Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader ?...
