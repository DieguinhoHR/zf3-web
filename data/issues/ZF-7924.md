### Description

As noted on fw-general and #zftalk.dev, 1.9.3 introduces a BC break in regards to the documented (per API, not manual) behavior of Zend\_Db::factory(), namely that the argument is case sensitive. The break should be reverted, while still supporting the fix for the adapter namespace case insensitivity.
