### Description

We had problems using wsdl definition created by Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover and Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeComplex. So we searched for the problem and wondered, why the strategy (method: \_addArrayOfComplexType) uses "soapenc" instead of "soap-enc". There is no namespace definition for "soapenc". After changing it to "soap-enc" and it works fine for us.
