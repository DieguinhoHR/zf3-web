It seems the problem is caused by incomplete merge from the trunk.

[ZF-3092] has commit with a revision number 9403 and 9404 (not actually attached to the issue, but mentioned in the merge commit and also links to the issue from the commit message).

[ZF-3092] also has commit with a revision number 9477 which merges trunk changes into the release-1.5 branch.

Both commits affect only two files: Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http/ObjectTest.php library/Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php

These files are identical in the trunk and in the release branch (accurate within @version tag) before these commits.

9403 + 9404 and 9477 are the latest updates for these files in both branches but they are different now.

Diffs between release-1.5 branch and trunk are exactly the same as differences between 9403 + 9404 and 9477 changesets (see attachments).

Fixed.

Both files are copied from the trunk: Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http/ObjectTest.php library/Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php
