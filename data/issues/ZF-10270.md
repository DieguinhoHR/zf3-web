### Description

I have found the standard naming conventions very helpful when it comes to classes stored in the default folder structure. I can look at a class named Application\_Model\_User and know I'm looking at a model class located in application\\model\\user.php.

Anything Zend\_? can normally be assumed to come from Library\\Zend and likewise for custom or third party libraries.

However, this does not seem to apply to the default view helper location (application\\views\\helpers). The above logic suggests that classes stored here should be Application\_View\_Helper\_Something, however it appears that, in order to be detected without (re)specifying a HelperPath, the helpers stored in that location need to be named Zend\_View\_Helper\_Something.

This just seems to be against the zend framework naming conventions, and I think it would be good to have changed to bring in line with pretty much everything else.

Cheers
