ZF-980: Zend\_Mail Should Allow Users to Specifiy MIME Part Parameters

### Description

Zend\_Mail::setBodyText() currently only allows a specific type of MIME part to be set. Users should be able to define parameters for the MIME part. For example, users should be able to set the encoding to 7bit, instead of the default QUOTEDPRINTABLE.

Perhaps setBodyText() should optionally accept an instance of Zend\_Mime\_Part?

But setBodyText() already returns the instance it creates. You could even use fluent interfaces to change the encoding type:

$mail->setBodyText('your body')->encoding = Zend\_Mime::ENCODING\_7BIT;

Or is this to complicated?

Accept first parameter to setBodyText() to be instance of Zend\_Mime\_Part

This patch adds an $encoding parameter to setBodyText() that allows user to override the default encoding of ENCODING\_QUOTEDPRINTABLE

Nico, you are right. I don't know how I missed that.

The addition of an encoding parameter is simple, and might make the method more intuitive. After all, the only two properties of Zend\_Mime\_Part that would ever need to be modified for setBodyText() are the encoding and charset.

Some documentation under getBodyText() reminding people that the variable is passed by reference might also go a long way.

Assign to Nico.

Encoding can be changed via the third parameter in setBodyText() and setBodyHtml().
