I'm closing this as not an issue as it appears to be a support request rather than an issue with any Zend Framework functionality.

Your view file appears to have the wrong suffix (usually it would be .phtml) check this, and ensure your error\_reporting is set to a level which will give you useful output in either your error logs, or browser.

Please also check that you are following the suggested application structure. If you are new to Zend Framework, you may wish to check out Akrabats tutorial <http://akrabat.com/zft>

Ryan, Thanks very much for your reply. sorry, i just made a mistake in typing. it is not index.php. In fact i used above code in the right extension 'index.phtml'(Application/Views/Scripts/index/index.phtml) only. As i am the beginner of zend php, i think i have to go through error\_reporting. in the mean time you can fix my problem i welcome. Thanks again.
