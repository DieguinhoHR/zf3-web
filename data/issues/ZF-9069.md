### Description

Hello, on my site I'm working with czech and english locales(months). I need to print this . If I use czech stand-alone/wide month is it ok, but when I switch to english it's just printing month numbers from root locales. Is there any way to get automatically default month representation in english which is set on format/wide?

Thanks.

Standalone/Wide does not exist for english.

Note: You can't rely on a localized format which does not exist and expect to get values returned. Not every format is available in every language.

You could use the default wide format instead of standalone.
