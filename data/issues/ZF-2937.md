### Description

Zend\_Element\_Radio elements lack ids for javascript access

I tested this on today's trunk and 1.5 release

Create a subform:

 
    <pre class="highlight">[subfrm]
    elements.subfrm.name = "0";
    elements.subfrm.type = "radio";
    elements.subfrm.options.belongsTo = "subfrm";
    elements.subfrm.options.disableLoadDefaultDecorators = "true";
    elements.subfrm.options.decorators.ViewHelper.decorator = "ViewHelper";
    elements.subfrm.options.value = "true";
    elements.subfrm.options.multiOptions.true = "";
    elements.subfrm.options.multiOptions.false = "";


After assigning it in the view, print it in the view

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?=$this->form->subfrm?>


The result it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
    <br></br>

Expected result

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
    <br></br>

A quick and dirty fix would be: Editing a part of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormRadio to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Wrap the radios in labels
                $radio = '_htmlAttribs($label_attribs) . '>'
                        . (('prepend' == $labelPlacement) ? $opt_label : '')
                        . '_htmlAttribs($attribs) 
                        . $endTag
                        . (('append' == $labelPlacement) ? $opt_label : '')
                        . '';


I don't think its intended to be fixed there however. I haven't digged into the id attaching for textfields etc enough to provide a better fix, maybe i'll do that later.

I did more search an learn work on the Zend Framework and actually it is an inconsistency in the Zend\_View\_Helpers. So i'll recreate the issue there, with a more to-the-point use case.

Reporter indicates the issue is with another component; closing.

Re-opening. This becomes an issue with Dojo's RadioButton dijit when using dojo programmatically; without an ID, we cannot identify the element to decorate it as a dijit.

Resolved in trunk as of r10025.
