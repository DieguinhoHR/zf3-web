The output of the stats command is change in version 0.2.0, see: [http://serverphorums.com/read.php/?9,74777,92986](http://www.serverphorums.com/read.php?9,74777,92986) I've fixed this with a regular expression, not sure if this is the best solution but it works and is backwards compatible

Line 221:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_queues[] = preg_replace('~STAT (\w+)(?:[ 0-9]*/?[0-9]*)~', '\\1', $line);

I've a patch attached to fix this issue, slightly changed the regex I already posted. Can someone review this to make sure it's working correctly?

Tim, could you please provide a couple of new possible values (or even better, unittests), so we can actually test this issue in the testsuite?

Thanks.
