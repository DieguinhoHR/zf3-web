Can you please attach as simple of an actionscript file as possible. This is something that works fine in the Flex SDK. Not sure if the object type is different from flash.

There isn't a whole lot to it. I'm using the Flex SDK 3.4.0.6955 and Flash player 10,0,22,87. The Date object is a native player class therefore it is framework agnostic. Any date object I pass to the gateway in any fashion results in Status 500 before any methods on the service classes are called. It seems to be a Zend AMF framework issue from my perspective. I just switched to 1.8.3 and the problem still exists. Date objects from Zend to Flex are fine. Date objects from Flex to Zend are where the problems exist.

This issues was resolved after downloading and installing the Zend Framework min. Please excuse my ignorance but I didn't see anything in the requirements about the Zend framework being a dependency. This is a non-issue now.
