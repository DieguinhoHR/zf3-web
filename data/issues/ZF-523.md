ZF-523: Update RewriteRouter docs in incubator to reflect current usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Improvement Created: 2006-11-09T14:33:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:27.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)
 
 Reporter:  Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew)  Assignee:  P치draic Brady (padraic)  Tags: - Zend\_Controller
 
 Related issues: 
 Attachments: - [Zend\_Controller-ProvidedSubclasses.xml](/issues/secure/attachment/10160/Zend_Controller-ProvidedSubclasses.xml)
 
### Description

Please update the RewriteRouter documentation in the incubator, in the Zend\_Controller-Provided\_Subclasses.xml file, to reflect current usage. Examples in there show the following notation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute('user', ':controller/:action);


which should actually be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute(
        new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('user', ':controller/:action')
    );

This one needs a bigger overhault as Router slightly changed it's function in the new MVC structure.

I've started editing Zend\_Controller-ProvidedSubclasses.xml and will commit it shortly.

I added the references to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route which was missing. I also altered the description of the compat route (it currently does allow additional parameters without defining specific routes). Also moved most of the RewriteBase spiel up to the section on Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http where it now belongs for the setBaseUrl() method proxied to Zend\_Http\_Request.

Hopefully this covers most of the out of sync issues. After committing, let me know of any improvements that could be made.

Attaching amended XML file (awaiting SVN access to commit, or for someone else to do so).

Have completed the update across two commits. Added rewrite rules for IIS and Lighttpd. Beefed up the description of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http. Edited the remaining text for consistency. See r1644.
