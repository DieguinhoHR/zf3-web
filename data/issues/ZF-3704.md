### Description

Some community members are attempting to add missing functionality to Zend\_Pdf through their own private implementations while they await improvements at the framework level . This is made difficult because Zend\_Pdf\_Page contains many private instance variables and methods, which makes effective subclassing impossible (see ZF-3701).

One common request is to add raw content to the page's content stream, for example, to manually draw aligned or justified text ([http://nabble.com/Zend\_Pdf-..-problems-extending-tâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Pdf-..-problems-extending-the-class-td18555196.html)). This would be made easier if Zend\_Pdf\_Page::rawWrite() was implemented since Zend\_Pdf\_Page::\_contents is a private instance variable.

Fixed in trunk. This may be a candidate for a backport to 1.6.0 if there is still time.
