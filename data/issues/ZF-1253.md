### Description

COPY OF ZF-1052. But the problems happens now with the Basic Auth.

- - - - - -

The http Adapter configured with digest auth has a bug with Firefox. If you enter no username or a username with a ":" in or non printable chars the specific adapter returns false and its not possible to re \_challengeClient with the client until the browser was restartet. (IE works perfect)

A solution would be to set the username to 'unknown' or something else to keep the auth process running and allow re \_challengeClient calls or return a specific value back to the calling script as a return code in the Zend\_Auth\_Result for user handling.

Tested with FF 1.5.0.10.
------------------------

workaround:

File: Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http.php Line: 516 + if (count($creds)!=2 || empty($creds[0]) || empty($creds[1])) { + return $this->\_challengeClient(); + }

the problem is that you never get a new challenge to change username or password this should work with my patch

Potentially fixed with r4531. I was unable to reproduce the problem. Using Firefox, the only invalid character I could enter at the login prompt was a colon, and doing so didn't cause the behavior originally observed in ZF-1052. Also, adding unit tests specifically for the invalid characters still did not cause the adapter to fail.

Regardless, I added stricter validation to the Basic auth credentials, so that they now are subject to exactly the same rules as the Digest auth credentials. (That is, invalid characters are explicitly checked for, and the client is re-challenged if they are present.)
