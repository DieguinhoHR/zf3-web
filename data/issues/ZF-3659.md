### Description

The manual section 10.5.6 describes deleting rows using the Zend\_Db\_Table component. The first paragraph underneath example 10.88 is repeated in the second paragraph. This paragraph mentions a second argument to Zend\_Db\_Table::delete(), but that method only takes one argument. It's the first argument that should be an array of SQL expressions.

Fixed with r12846 to refer to a single argument of variable type.
