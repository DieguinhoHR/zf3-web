ZF-4013: No Zend\_Json\_Server\_Response::loadJson() method
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-08-20T08:02:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:00.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Json\_Server\_Response does not have a loadJson() method as Zend\_Json\_Server\_Request does. This would be useful for testing a web service implementation that uses Zend\_Json\_Server by allowing a string containing the web service response to be converted into a properly populated response object.
