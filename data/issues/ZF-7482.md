### Description

When using Zend\_Feed\_Reader::import with conditional gets and a cache is registered the import fails always due to the wrong logical or when testing the HTTP response status code in line 247. Changing it to the intended logical and fixes the problem.

Your report is very much appreciated. I've fixed the issue in trunk (rev 17390) and will merge to the 1.9 branch shortly.
