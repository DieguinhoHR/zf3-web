ZF-783: Problems with $this->redirect

### Description

After upgrading to 0.7.0 i get the following error when using $this->\_redirect("/"), it used to work fine on earlier versions.

Fatal error: Call to a member function setRedirect() on a non-object in /home/irendon/projects/nofep/Zend\_0\_7\_0/library/Zend/Controller/Action.php on line 520

It seems SetRedirect never gets created in the function.

Thanks,

Ivan

I suspect the issue is that you are overriding \_\_construct() in your action controller, and the response object is not being set. Lines 519-520 read:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $response = $this->getResponse();
    $response->setRedirect($url, $code);


The error you're getting indicates to me that $response is not a response object -- which would only be the case if you didn't set it in the controller.

If you are overriding \_\_construct() in your action controller, try either renaming the method to init() or doing something like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request, Zend_Controller_Response_Abstract $response, array $invokeArgs = null)
    {
        parent::__construct($request, $response, $invokeArgs);
        // continue processing
    }


Let me know if none of these solutions work.
