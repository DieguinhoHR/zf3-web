ZF-569: Requests include full URI
---------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2006-11-19T00:47:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:29.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client includes the full URI in the request. For instance, a request may look like:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    GET <a href="https://www.website.com/path?key=value">https://www.website.com/path?key=value</a> HTTP/1.1


Instead of:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    GET /path?key=value HTTP/1.1


The attached patch fixes this.

Just out of curiosity, is this really a _bug_ (in a sense that it causes problems?) AFAIK, sending the full URI is completely RFC compliant and maybe even better if you go through a proxy.

If this is just a cosmetic issue, I will fix it only if the fix is simple enough.

Setting fix version to 0.6.0.

It does cause the following page to break: [https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS\_WEB/Sor/â€¦](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS_WEB/Sor/index.aspx?PageIndex=Search&SubmitType=Address). Sending the full URI results in a 404 Not Found error, whereas sending the partial URI by applying the attached patch causes it to work fine.

I suppose this is really a bug in IIS, but it would be nice to get ZF to work with it properly.

Thanks.
