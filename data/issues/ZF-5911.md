ZF-5911: Zend\_Form::isErrors() not returning child errors
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-02-27T11:18:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-02-18T16:44:29.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

API documentation of Zend\_Form::isErrors() is "Are there errors in the form?".

As such I expect $form->isErrors() to return true when a child element has errors but it's not always the case.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Form.php';
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    var_dump($form->isErrors()); // output 'false' => ok
    $form->addElement('text', 'name')->name->addError('invalid');
    var_dump($form->isErrors()); // output 'false' => *NOT ok*
    var_dump($form->name->hasErrors()); // output 'true' => ok


Proposed solution: 1. check presence of errors live

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    ...
    /**
    * Return true if errors are registered in the form and its elements, false otherwise
    *
    * @return bool
    */
    public function isErrors()
    {
     if ($this->_errorsExist) {
      return true;
     }
    
     foreach ($this->getElements() as $elem) {
      if ($elem->hasErrors()) {
       return true;
      }
     }
    
     return false;
    }    


Note: I think this is what's meant in this issue (<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5559>) however it looks more like a bug to me than an improvement.

I forgot to add error already registered on the form itself in proposed Zend\_Form::getErrors() function.

To avoid name collision with child elements, I used array\_push() to add errors attached on the form element itself but we could use 'form' key to have a more explicit array key.

Removal of Zend\_Form::getErrors() rewritting that was not appropriate

I find that outputting errors on Zend\_Form is a bit tricky, I've listed here (with screenshots) some cases that look very odd: <http://www.qc4blog.com/?p=527>

What's going on guys?

This is 3 years old in a few days time and I see no sign of it being resolved in 1.11.11
