### Description

Forms no longer display "Is not an Image" warnings because IsImage validator was changed in 1.9.3. Validation function was moved from the IsImage class to the MimeType class where other constant-values are used for the message-array-reference.

Changing the consts to the following in the IsImage class solves the problem: const FALSE\_TYPE = 'fileMimeTypeFalse'; const NOT\_DETECTED = 'fileMimeTypeNotDetected'; const NOT\_READABLE = 'fileMimeTypeNotReadable';

One alternative would be to change the const-context when called from subclass.
