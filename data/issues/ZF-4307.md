ZF-4307: Zend\_Form '5507' was not found in the haystack error for select element

### Description

When I use 1.6 or 1.6.1 I get the error "'5495' was not found in the haystack" for the following "school" form element.

$school = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select('school'); $school->setLabel('School Attending') ->setRequired(false) ->setDescription('Choose State first') ->addMultiOptions(array('---'=>'')) ->addFilter('StripTags') ->addFilter('StringTrim') ->addValidator('Int');

This generates a list looking like this, which appears fully correct.

name1name2name3

If I revert the Form.php and Form dir inside the Zend library dir back to the 1.5.0 version, it works just fine.

Well I was shocked by this behaviour also at first time. Luckily when I looked into code, I have discovered that InArray validator is enabled automatically if validator was not present.

This behaviour can be change when you call $element->setRegisterInArrayValidator(false);

But I also believe that this validator should be disabled by default

We enabled the validator by default because it was an oft-requested feature; we had users who were, to use your own verbiage, "shocked" that the multi-elements were not auto-registering an InArray validator based on the attached options.

There is a documented way to disable the validator, so there's nothing here to fix or change.

OK, sounds reasonable. I used that validator maily for ignore the 0 => " -- select -- " but this can be validate by GreaterThan(0) validator

I think this happens only when the value is numeric is sent in the array for validation because the problem had not had a string array identifiacdores zend but that seems a php error.

the solution works but not if it is really valid if I want to validate the information with such arrays
