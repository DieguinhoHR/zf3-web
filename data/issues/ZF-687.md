### Description

The wikification does not automatically add new chapters or sections to the docu.

Can be seen for Zend\_Date-Overview. It was added 22.12. 23:00 UTC per SVN But with 23.12. 15:00 it is not added to the wiki... it's ignored.

Should be added, so that new pages must not be included per hand.

Sometimes new sections/chapters do not get added, because there is an error somewhere in the docbook files. The reason why Zend\_Date-Overview didn't get added, is because, currently, there are 2 errors in the incubator docs. See [this link](http://gavin.zfdev.com/doc/INCUBATOR.html). This is causing the wiki incubator documentation not to update.

Not an issue. Documentation teams should test their xml with xmllint before comiting. Please see [this page](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/1g)
