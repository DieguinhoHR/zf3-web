### Description

I didn't know how to categorize this request so I have put it in here.

It would be nice to be able to edit or delete comments made before (here in the Issue Tracker) in case there are typos or other errors. Actually editing nor deleting is possible.

Thank you! With best regards Inno

You can already both edit and delete your own comments as long as you are logged in.
