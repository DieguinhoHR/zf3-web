### Description

Emanuele Deserti: How I can identify the last item in my paginator? NOT the last in the current page, but the last item in the last page.

For example: I have 100 items paginated into 5 pages (20 items per page); I need to display custom content only for the 100th (the last of all).

I've tried with getTotalItemCount(), getCurrentItemCount() and so on but without success... Also googled around and look into API core doc but nothing useful found...

Matthew Razloff: You should be able to do something like this (after setting up the paginator):

$item = end($paginator->getItemsByPage(count($paginator)));

Untested, but that should at least put you on the right track.

Emanuele Deserti: Thanks that's work and I use it as final solution.

However it will be interesting if it's possible identify the last item directly in the view script, inside the foreach against the paginator himself :)

There's a way to do it? Or it's useless as we can use your code?

There is a way to do it yes : code the fetchLastItem() method (or any other method name) in Zend\_Paginator class. I can do that

The enhancement should be the addition of a getItemByIndex() method to Zend\_Paginator.

Resolved in r17280. Last item of last page can be grabbed with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paginator->getItem(-1, -1);


The second last item can be grabbed like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paginator->getItem(-2, -1);


etc.
