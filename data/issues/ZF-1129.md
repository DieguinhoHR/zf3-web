ZF-1129: Correct logic in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::\_prepareReference()

### Description

On line 475, we can see

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if (!isset($map[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::REF_COLUMNS])) {
        $info = $table->info();
        $map[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::REF_COLUMNS] = $info['primary'];
    }


Which means that if the 'refColumns' arg has not been set in the reference table '$\_referenceMap', then use the reference table primary key But you don't get the reference table info , as $table here represents the dependent table, and not the reference one.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $info = $this->_table->info();


should be used instead.

I analyze it this way:

- findDependentRowset(): $table is the dependent table, and $tableClass is the class name of the parent class.
- findParentRow(): $table is the current table, and $tableClass is the class name of the parent class.
- findManyToManyRowset(): $table is the intersection table, and $tableClass is the class name of either the origin master table or the destination master table.

In all of the above cases, if the 'refColumns' is not present in the referenceMap array, then the primary key columns of the class named by $tableClass is the one to use, not the primary key columns of $this->\_table.
