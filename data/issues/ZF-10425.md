ZF-10425: Zend\_Filter\_Input's isValid method returns a bad result when checking against a nonexistent field name

### Description

As the summary states, when calling the isValid method of Zend\_Filter\_Input with a field name that doesn't exist (fields not present in the form), a boolean false is returned. This isn't entirely bad behaviour, however, considering fields can be defined as having an optional presence, calling isValid on the field name and returning false is inaccurate. The field simply doesn't exist, it's not invalid. It has been defined in the validator, though. Additionally, whilst calling isValid($fieldName) will return false, calling isValid without passing any field name will return a value of true (as expected).

If my explanation isn't very clear, or you would like further clarification, I would be happy to oblige.
