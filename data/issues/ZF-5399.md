### Description

Validators don't seem to apply to checkboxes

 
    // ACCEPT CONDITIONS
         $this->addElement(
                    'CheckBox',
                    'contract',
                    array(
                        'label'        => 'I accept the terms of service',
                        'style'            =>'margin-left:100px;',
                        'required'   => true,
                        'checkedValue' => '1',
                        'validators'     =>  array(array('NotEmpty', true)),
                    )
                );


This seems considered valid ; and whatever validator is put in the validation never seems to occur.

I cannot reproduce this in the event of a different validator. NotEmpty is by default added when 'required' => true. However, checkbox has '0' or '1' as a value which would be correct since there was indeed a value set. If you would like the NotEmpty validator or required to trigger an error please use uncheckedValue = null as the following will evaludate to false.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Form.php';
    
    $_GET['test'] = 0;
    
    $f = new Zend_Form();
    $f->addElement(
        'Checkbox',
        'test',
        array(
            'required' => true,
            'uncheckedValue' => null
        )   
    );
    var_dump($f->isValid($_GET)); // is and should be false
    


To show you how you could utilize InArray to be able to utilize this event as well:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Form.php';
    
    $_GET['test'] = 1;
    
    $f = new Zend_Form();
    $f->addElement(
        'Checkbox',
        'test',
        array(
            'validators' => array(
                array('InArray', true, array(array(2)))
            )   
        )   
    );
    var_dump($f->isValid($_GET)); // is and should be false
