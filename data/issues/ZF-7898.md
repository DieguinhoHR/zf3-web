### Description

The Short and Long Description can easily be used to show additional information about actions.

The appended patch shows always the short description and if a filter on provider oder actions performed also the long description is shown.

This could be integrated with the "Indentation" patch to allow a nice look of that description.

New patch for the HelpSystem.php only.

Using specialties with providers i realized my previous solution for the display order is bullshit.

However i also realized that there is no way to get hold of the specialties actions short descriptions, since they are not present in the action repository.
