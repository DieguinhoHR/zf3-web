### Description

Noticed fired from Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext which causes phpunit to throw exception.

svn cat [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.9.1/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter/Gettext.php) |head -n148 |tail -n 1

$this->\_data[$locale][''] = trim($this->\_data[$locale]['']);

If index doesn't exist..notice is produced $this->\_data[$locale]['']

Isset seems to fix the issue.

Not able to reproduce this behaviour. The attached test-mo file has the info tags set and they are being read and outputted.

I am totally confused.

With ZF I always get the notice..unless the isset

With cakephp (they work directly on .po files) I see the notice in their code (again where they do ['']) only when both the .po and .mo files exists. If only .po file exists there is no notice using cakephp.

I know that ZF doesn't care about cakephp but find it totally confusing.

I guess can close this ticket as bogus :(

It could be depended on the phpunit release you are using. ZF must be tested with 3.3 or above.

Regarding gettext: The ZF implementation is pure php based and does not use the gettext extension. As mo files have to info tag ('') always available there is no reason why a notice should be thrown. A mo file without info tag is a broken file. The tag can be empty, but it's always available.

Closing as not reproducable. Feel free to reopen it when you have new informations regarding this issue.
