### Description

Hello,

I am not calling directly Size validator. Anyway, i am receiving this error.

Multiple constructor options are deprecated in favor of a single options array in D:\_Work\\coreshifter\\run\\library\\Zend\\Validate\\File\\Size.php on line 115

I am not sure if is due to my code or is a ZF issue.

As the error describes you are calling the size validator like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Validate_File_Size(10, 30);


and this is depreciated since 1.7.0 or 1.6.2. As described in the manual you should use

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Validate_File_Size(array('min' => 10, 'max' => 30));


This is not a failure but the only way to inform users that their input is not correct.

So how should be writed some code for setting a Size validator for a form element ?

This seems to not work.

elements.TEMPLATE.options.validators.size.validator = "Size" elements.TEMPLATE.options.validators.size.options.min = 0kb elements.TEMPLATE.options.validators.size.options.max = 4MB

This is a problem of Zend\_Config in relation with Zend\_Form. Please ask in the mailing list how to configure a config file so you get a array.
