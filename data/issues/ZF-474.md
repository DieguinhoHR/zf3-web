### Description

Dear Vendor, It is a standard procedure for our Security Team to inform you about the vulnerability found in your project. The following vulnerabilities have been verified by our security team and could be attacked easily.

The vulnerabilities are:

if ($\_GET['redirection'] < 4) { header("Location: http://" . $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] . $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF'] . '?redirection=' . $\_GET['redirection']); } else { var\_dump($\_GET); var\_dump($\_POST);

[http://[HOST}/ZendFramework/ZendFramework-0.2.0/â€¦](/ZendFramework/ZendFramework-0.2.0/incubator/tests/Zend/Http/_files/testRedirections.php/?redirection=3&%5BANY%5D=%5BXSS)]

Raising priority of such a bug. It's important to show best practices, even in sample scripts and tests.

Assigning to Shahar.

We understand that the reported security vulnerability is minor and qualifies as a vulnerability by a somewhat thin definition.

Nevertheless, we take such reports seriously and strive to eliminate any such occurrances from shipping code. If nothing else, doing so eliminates trivial (or even spurious) reports of security weaknesses. This can help customers adopt the Zend Framework with confidence.

This report is completely bogus - The file is a dummy file used for testing purposes and is completely unrelated to any framework component. It doesn't contain any real information and is not really a part of the Framework's libraries. Therefore, it cannot be used in any XSS attack.

This appears to be a "spamvert" highlighting a broken tool used by this company, without a human involved to realize their tool produced a false diagnosis.
