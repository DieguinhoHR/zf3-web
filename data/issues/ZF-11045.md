### Description

On line 196 in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract, the header content get imploded.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $value = implode(',' . $this->EOL . ' ', $content);


This cause my server to write the "to", "cc", "bcc" sometimes in the "from" section and other crazy things.

Releated to <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322>: {quote} to = "To:" address-list CRLF cc = "Cc:" address-list CRLF bcc = "Bcc:" [address-list / CFWS] CRLF {quote}

Where stands nowhere, that each address needs a new line, only at the end of complete address-list.

So right should be (like it works also for me)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $value = implode(',' . ' ', $content);

Martin, can you please provide a full example (code) of usage which causes invalid headers to be generated?

I have not been able to reproduce your issue. Could you please provide more details? (some sample code, the adapter you are using, and if applicable the mail server make/model you are sending mail through)

I believe that EOL character is introduced between recipients as an easy way to work around the 78-character line limit. RFC-5322 calls this "folding", and is talked about in the ["Long Header Fields" section](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-2.2.3). Addresses can be suffixed by CFWS, so folding in this case is acceptable and standard-compliant mail servers should respect it and not mess up the headers.

I have been unable to reproduce, and no response from OP for 2+ months. Can I close this as "Cannot Reproduce", or does someone else want to take a stab at it?
