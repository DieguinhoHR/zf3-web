ZF-5437: isDate potentially unsafe
----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Performance Improvement Created: 2009-01-09T07:29:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-02-06T09:42:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

The use of Date::isDate() can potentially lead to a DOS attack on a site where dates are validated using Zend\_Validate\_Date, consider the following example:

$formElement->addValidator( new Zend\_Validate\_Date( 'DD.MM.YYYY', new Zend\_Locale( 'de\_DE' ) );

User Input such as 12.12.123123123 (basically anything really far in the future) will send CPU usage to 100%

Maybe the function should have some kind of sensible bounds built in or at least the documentation should make users aware of this.

Could be just me, but doesn't this go for all resource-intensive 'scripts' (sorry Thomas)? If more resources than available are requested on purpose, a server is considered under attack. I can't see how this specifically relates to Zend\_Date (or the Zend Framework in general).
