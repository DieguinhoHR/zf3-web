### Description

_Steps to reproduce:_

- Send an empty request to a SOAP server

_Expected results:_

- Invalid XML error returned

Note: This is the actual error returned by ZF 1.11.13 for example.

_Actual results:_

- SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from ... : failed to load external entity

_Example script:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once('Service.php');
    
    require_once('Zend/Soap/Server.php');
    
    $wsdl = __DIR__ . '/wsdl.xml';
    
    $soapServer = new Zend_Soap_Server($wsdl);
    
    $soapServer->setClass('Service');
    $soapServer->handle();


 \*Result from ZF 1.12.0:\* 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Warning:  SoapServer::SoapServer(): I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/home/test/wsdl.xml" in /usr/share/php/Zend/Soap/Server.php on line 811
    PHP Fatal error:  SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from '/home/test/wsdl.xml' : failed to load external entity "/home/test/wsdl.xml"

Just as a note, the I/O warning is stupid to say the least since the WSDL file (or URL) actually exists.
