### Description

For the record: This bug is connected to encoded slashes in URLs & I know of the problem / necessity to have AllowEncodedSlashes On in the Apache configuration.

_Problem:_ After an update to Zend version 1.11.1 (from an earlier version, can't remember which ) I noticed that the framework didn't build correct routes and request parameters anymore if there were encoded slashes ("%2F") in one of the URL parameters (what's between 2 "real" slashes /). Requests which worked previously failed suddenly.

_Fix:_ Remove (comment) line in Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php:626 (in method setPathInfo()):

// $requestUri = urldecode($requestUri);

Haven't noticed any side effects so far. I would appreciate if this change could be implemented in trunk (or other fix for the problem).

Confirmed this is an issue for me as well. It seems that a symptom may have been fixed in Zend\_Rest\_Route <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10964>. The diff here appears to be the most likely solution: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3527>.

My problem specifically is with double decoding plus (+) signs in params but this would be an issue with any similar character which can be decoded twice with two different results (from %2B to a plus sign to a space).

My 2 cents: I suspect that the root cause is Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setPathInfo() line 626: $requestUri = urldecode($requestUri);. As such, the fix to Zend\_Rest\_Route would likely need to be rolled back if my suspicion is correct.

It turns out that this could actually be a triple urldecode issue when Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::match() comes into play and the route contains a wildcard.

It works for me with the diff from ZF-3527 and removing the urldecode from line 240 of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //$this->_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? urldecode($path[$i+1]) : null;
    $this->_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? $path[$i+1] : null;

Potential fix in trunk at r24002 - asking for watchers to test now.

Confirmed this also fixes the issue of double decodable characters in slashy params.
