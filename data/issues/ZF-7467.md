### Description

Zend\_Acl addResource() and addRole() should accept strings when configuring to allow for a more expressive setup.

Semantically speaking, $acl->addResource(new Zend\_Acl\_Resource('someresource')) offers no value over $acl->addResource('someresource'); thus the latter should be allowed
