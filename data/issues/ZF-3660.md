Duplicates #ZF-3578

this is not really duplicate. this here patches the code to check the given xml-file for existance and readability, not touching the simplexml\_load\_file part.

it's really not to clear how one should handle the simplexml part in #ZF-3578, the thrown php-errors have very interesting messages in it, debugging is quite easy with those, still you wouldn't want them in production env, but definitely in dev-env...
