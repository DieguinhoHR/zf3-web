Why is this component assigned to Wil ??? What is the dev-branch 1.7 ?

I can't find it in SVN... how should I solve this when no branch is available ?

I can not verify this on my environment.

I increased the faliure output. Can you please verify this on your environment ?

A possible reason is that this test is related to the fileinfo component. And therefor fully depends on the used magic.mime file. Probably the 'zip' mimetype can not be detected by your environment. We will see on the added output where the problem is.

Silly me... I forgot to add the file which is tested against. :-)

Should work now with latest trunk.
