ZF-3662: HtmlTag decorator bug
------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-17T01:22:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-07-18T14:43:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I am using HtmlTag decorator for forms elements:

elementdecorators.decorator = "ViewHelper" elementdecorators.label = "Label" elementdecorators.rowtag.type.rowtag = "HtmlTag" elementdecorators.rowtag.options.tag = "

<

div>"

So would be rendered (correctly) for one element this:

Cuvinte cheie

If i try to set class for a specific element like this:

$form->keywords->getDecorator('rowtag')->setOption('class', 'cl');

I get instead a wrong code...



<

div>Rubrica

I think is a bug on HtmlTag decorator...

Mya not be an error due to this (but rather due to bad config settings), still checking.

The 'tag' option should not contain brackets -- it should be just 'div'. Change this, and comment back to indicate if it worked or not. Also, please indicate if you are using a specific version of ZF, or from svn trunk (and, if the latter, what revision).

As worked out on-list, this is not an issue. There may be an improvement necessary to make it easier to use the StripTags filter with configuration passed via Zend\_Form (and doc improvements for the filter itself), but those should be opened as separate issues.

As it is, the issue as reported is a non-issue, and I have verified that options can be passed to filters.
