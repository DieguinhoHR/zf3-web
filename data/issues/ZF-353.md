I have made a small script that generates a HTML page. We can then pass this file to htmldoc to generate a PDF from it.

I attatched the script and an example pdf document below.

the following script could be used (if htmldoc is installed) to generate the PDF from the HTML output:

 <?php function topdf($filename, $options = null) { header("Content-Type: application/pdf;charset=utf-8"); flush(); passthru("htmldoc -t pdf --jpeg --quiet --footer . --left 20mm --right 10mm --top 0mm --bottom 10mm --webpage $options '$filename'"); } topdf($\_GET['url']); ?>
