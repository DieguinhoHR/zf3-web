### Description

Currently there is no way to obtain the namespace string (protected $\_namespace property) of a Zend\_Session\_Namespace instance. There should be a getNamespace() or similar method for obtaining this property after instantiation.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Could the opener provide a case where this would be useful? ATM, the only thing I can come up with is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($session->getNamespace() == 'mySession'){
     // do some stuff
    }


but this can be done with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($session->namespaceIsset('mySession')){
     // do some stuff
    }


If there's no other useful case for this, then it's just duplication.
