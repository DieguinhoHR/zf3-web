### Description

The following sentence is from the "Connecting to the server from Flex" sectoin of the Zend\_Amf documentation:

"From the properties popup select 'Flex Compiler' and add the string: -services "services-config.xml"."

An absolute path to services.config.xml should be provided in order for this compiler argument to work. Otherwise you will get an unhelpful error message with no details from Flex Builder.

I don't think this is an issue. It worked for me, but I had to substitute the quotes pasted in from the browser. When pasting in the code from the documentation, be sure to swap in the correct quotes (").
