### Description

In the function encode() in the class Zend\_Pdf\_Filter\_Compression\_Flate there is a problem with the usage of an uninitialized variable in line 54. The line looks like this:

throw new Zend\_Pdf\_Exception($php\_errormsg);

The variable $php\_errormsg has not been initialized in the context of the function encode() nor was it passed to the function as a parameter.

$php\_errormsg is a predefined PHP variable that exists whenever the track\_errors configuration option is enabled (see [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php#reserved.variables.phperrormsg) ). track-errors is always enabled in this function on line 50.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
