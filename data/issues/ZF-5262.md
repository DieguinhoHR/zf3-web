ZF-5262: Bad performance of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::find with Oracle (and in general with Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_fetch)

### Description

All fetch's method of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract (fetchAll, fetchRow) don't allow to bind parameters. This is a problem with Oracle (and perhaps with others RDBMS). Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // $table is instance of Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    $table->find(1);
    // generate: SELECT foo.* FROM foo WHERE (((foo.bar = '1')))
    $table->find(2);
    // generate: SELECT foo.* FROM foo WHERE (((foo.bar = '2')))


For Oracle, this corresponds to 2 completely differents requests. So it needs 2 parsing and 2 executions.

If we allow parameters binding, we could obtain 1 single request:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT foo.* FROM foo WHERE (((foo.bar = :baz)))


The first time, we have parsing and execution but each next time, we will have just the execution without any parsing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this could be change without any BC breaks. We can change internal process of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract: - the method find() calls fetchAll(). - fetchAll could be called by 2 ways: -- fetchAll($where = null, $order = null, $count = null, $offset = null) -- fetchAll(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select $where) - in case of second way, the other parameters are ignored ($order, $count, $offset )

My proposition: - during find() method: creation of binding array - end of find() method: creation of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select instance - and calling of fetchAll like this: fetchAll(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select $where, $bind) - in fetchAll method, retrieve $bind in case of where is a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select instance otherwise null - and calling \_fetch() with new optional $bind parameter - in \_fetch() call db adapter query() method with $bind
