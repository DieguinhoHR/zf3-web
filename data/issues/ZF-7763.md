### Description

I've just started with ZF, so maybe its not actualy a bug, but for me its an unexpected thing. I'm using route with \* modifier to accept additonal params via url. Next is code from docs, the only modification is "/\*" in the end of the route

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // the following route is added to the ZF router
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRouter()->addRoute(
        'article_view', // route name
        new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
            'a/:id/*',
            array(
                'module'     => 'news',
                'controller' => 'article',
                'action'     => 'view',
                'id'         => null
            )
        )
    );
    
    // a page is created with a 'route' option
    $page = new Zend_Navigation_Page_Mvc(array(
        'label'      => 'A news article',
        'route'      => 'article_view',
        'module'     => 'news',    // required for isActive(), see note above
        'controller' => 'article', // required for isActive(), see note above
        'action'     => 'view',    // required for isActive(), see note above
        'params'     => array('id' => 42)
    ));
    
    // returns: /a/42
    $href = $page->getHref();


Actualy will return _/a/42/module/news/controller/article/action/view_ module, controller and action were treated as url parameters.

I've suffered from this problem as well - if its not a bug I think the manual may be missing some information.

The "weirdness" you experience is just the way Zend\_Controller\_Router\* works, and it is not a bug.
