### Description

There's thing that bothers me is when using Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CurrencyTextBox with currency set to, let's say 'PLN': it's displaying value with all advantages of dijit.form.currencytextbox, but this dojo element actually returns not-localized, plain float to form field.

What makes the problem is Zend\_Validate\_Float, which is using Zend\_Locale. When it receives float string, not number, it does not recognize it as dotted float is not compliant with Polish locale.

Reproduction: 1. Set CurrencyTextBox 'value' to 12.34 and 'currency' to 'PLN' (locale: 'pl' or 'pl\_PL'). 2. While displaying dijit.form.currencytextbox it displays locale-aware value ('pl\_PL' - 12,34), but input holds '12.34' and that value is POSTed 3. Zend\_Validate\_Float gets string '12.34' and does not recognizes it as float, then tries to use Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat($value, array('locale' => $this->\_locale)) - but fails to recognize, because value returned from dijit has dot instead of comma.

I had to create my custom float validator that is exact copy of Zend\_Validate\_Float but has one more check between is\_float() and try{} section - if (is\_string($value) && is\_numeric($value)) - but that is not elegant way, isn't it?

Solution suggested by Thomas Weidner was to set English locale just for Zend\_Validate\_Float, but it is good solution only when you know that client browser has javascript enabled, but what if somebody needs it working in both situations? If javascript is disabled, dijit won't convert it to English locale, and there will be message: '12,34' does not appear to be a float.

So still, possible solutions are:

1. find out how to force dijit to return localized value and make Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CurrencyTextBox to do that (if Zend\_Locale is enabled and Zend\_Validate\_Float is in use, otherwise it will be ok)
2. use is\_numeric() in Zend\_Validate\_Float() after is\_float() and before Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat() - not elegant way, might pass not only floats, but does not break app

I would use filters like LocalizedToNormalized before validation process. In my opinion, the float validator shouldn't even be locale aware...
