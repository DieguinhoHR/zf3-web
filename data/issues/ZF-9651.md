ZF-9651: Disabled elements should not be validate
-------------------------------------------------

### Description

I think that Zend\_Form elements shouldn't be validate. For example I have got:

 
        $firstName = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('firstName');
        $firstName
            ->setRequired(true)
            ->setLabel( 'First name' )
            ->addValidator( Model_User_Validator::firstName() )
            ->addFilter('StringTrim');


In my project Admin can edit user's first name but user can't do that himself (I use Zend\_Acl). When I make this element disable [$form->getElement('firstName')->setAttrib('disable', true)] and post a form, the element is still validate but it's empty and i have got an error.

This makes a second problem. Every validate process overwrite the default value of firstName by value from form. We should to remember that disabled elements can be easy undisable by users.

I think that the best way is not to validate disabled elements at all. It's my proposition: In Zend\_Form (class) I suggest to put twice 'contine' if disabled - like this:

 
          foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
         >>   if ($element->getAttrib('disable')) {
         >>       continue;
         >>   }
              $element->setTranslator($translator);
              if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                  $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
              } else {
                  $valid = $element->isValid($data[$key], $data) && $valid;
              }
          }


ps

The resolution might be to not setRequired() your 'firstName' Element, that is the cause for validating it at all.
