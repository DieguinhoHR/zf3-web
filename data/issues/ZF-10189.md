ZF-10189: Missing require\_once for Zend\_Log in Zend\_Cache\_Core
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In \_loggerSanity(), if Zend\_Cache\_Core is initialised before autoloading has been turned on, a missing require\_once statement for Zend\_Log causes:

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Log' not found in /path/to/library/Zend/Cache/Core.php on line 717

(as at revision 21293).

Can be easily worked around by autoloading earlier, requiring Zend\_Log yourself or turning off logging, but probably should be fixed nonetheless.
