### Description

please investigate why data from two CSV files appears corrupted sorry. didn't find how can I attach a file anyway language files and cache file can be downloaded from <http://digital.homeunix.net/ZF/issue.tar.gz>

as far as I understand, there is a php bug. but workaround for such case could be to let user choose what method is used when accessing CSV file, either fgetcsv or fget as it was in ZF 1.5

thx

As notes in the manual CSV files are not locale aware. You must set UTF-8 in your server and also use UTF-8 encoded CSV files otherwise you will get errors.

This is a php bug. No solution from within the framework.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.

Can there be two Csv adapters for users to choose (i.e. one using fgetcsv as in 1.5 and another one using fget as in ZF 1.5?) The ZF 1.5 adapter indeed works (at least for my case).
