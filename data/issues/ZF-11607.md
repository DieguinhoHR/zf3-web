### Description

If I want to cache the Translations and my translations are larger than 1 MB Memcache Caching fails. This is normal because of the fact that Memcache only supports til 1 MB.

Zend\_Translate should be realy checking if the Translation is in the cache and not only if it is active. (Zend\_Cache test() function with the id).

<148 set Zend\_Translate\_fbb627815194a7eb92a9b65e6e71a1bb\_Db 1 7200 16756097

> 148 SERVER\_ERROR object too large for cache

$translate = Zend\_Registry::get('Zend\_Translate'); Zend\_Debug::dump($translate); Zend\_Debug::dump($translate->hasCache()); die();

My Output is "1" (does Cache exists), which is correct, but it implicates a status, that may not really exist.

When you add a cache then "hasCache" is always true regardless of stored or not stored content. The only thing which can be done and seems to be correct in such a case is to throw an exception. Because when a cache can not be written but you said store in cache its a severe problem.
