That looks like the problem is caused by several Zend\_Search\_Lucene object creation. Each with option "create index".

It's not common use case, but should be handled correctly.

I investigate the problem now.

Fixed in SVN.

Another "bug" mentioned in source code comments is caused by file deleting problem on Windows platforms. It's added to issue tracker as [ZF-412](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-412)
