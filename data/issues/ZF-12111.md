### Description

In my bootstrap, I initialize FlashMessenger for use in the application. When moving the app to a new server which did not yet have a valid session.save\_path set, the application fails to run and results in a blank screen even though display\_errors is on and error\_reporting is set to E\_ALL. An exception is thrown but is masked by an error handler, and FlashMessenger doesn't wrap its call to Zend\_Session\_Namespace in a try...catch block which results in a fatal uncaught exception error; but the fatal error is not displayed.

When constructing a FlashMessenger object, it creates a new Zend\_Session\_Namespace which can throw an exception if the session fails to start, however the call to new Zend\_Session\_Namespace in FlashMessenger::\_\_construct is not in a try catch block.

Zend\_Session::start registers its own error handler to see if session\_start fails so the error is masked. This error handler seemed to stay active and masked further PHP fatal errors from being output.

TO REPRODUCE: Create a new Zend\_Application. Set the session.save\_path in php.ini to an invalid directory Set display\_errors to On and error\_reporting to E\_ALL in php.ini Add a method \_initFlashMessenger to your Bootstrap.php file with the following code: $flashMessenger = Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('FlashMessenger'); Run your application in the browser

EXPECTED RESULT: An exception or application error saying the session failed to start

ACTUAL RESULT: A page with no output and no messages added to any error\_log
