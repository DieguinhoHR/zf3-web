See: [Zend Application Core Functionality](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.core-functionality.html) This problem blocks the parameters section of the table

Affected browsers: Chrome (Vista) IE8 (Vista) FireFox (XP/Vista)

So appearantly it is not an browser bug

Should be fixable by dividing the table or fixing widths

My resolution is 1600\*1080, but the problem stays present even when resizing the window

This seems to be an issue with long words and how browsers apply css to wrapping them; e.g., Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_IBootstrap

It looks like it is unfortunately handled in different ways by different browsers; [http://petesbloggerama.blogspot.com/2007/02/…](http://petesbloggerama.blogspot.com/2007/02/firefox-ie-word-wrap-word-break-tables.html), thus there's no one solution.

Using Firebug I was able to add the following to get at least a possible solution.

code.code { display: block; width: 140px; overflow-x: auto; word-wrap: break-word; }

I think if you apply it only to tables it will leave the ` blocks in the rest of the text alone.`

table code.code { display: block; width: 140px; overflow-x: auto; word-wrap: break-word; }

Did a bit of testing in IE6, IE7, FF3, Opera 9.26 and Safari 3.2. The word-wrap in IE7, IE6, doesn't auto-adjust the width of the column when width: 140px is set. And overflow: auto doesn't work well for the height in some code blocks; the min-height and height: 50px seems to take care of it. FF, Safari and Opera have no problem with overflow height and the min-height property doesn't bother them either. The only other way to deal with the issue, that I can think of at the moment, would be to have the back-end split long words after so many characters with a space, so Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_IBootstrap would become Zend\_Application\_ Bootstrap\_IBootstrap.

In summary, the IE6 stylesheet could use the following: table code.code { font-size: 1.1em; width: 140px; height: 50px; display: block; }

The others in the manual.css could use: table code.code { font-size: 1.1em; width: 140px; min-height: 50px; display: block; overflow: auto;  
 }

Funny how you've got to come up with different solutions when it appears to be the same problem in many different browsers.

Damn you, IE!!

A soft hyphen could also be used '&shy;'

Most browsers treat this as hinting for where hyphens should go if the word needs to be broken. A soft hyphen won't force a line break if there is enough space to display it.

For example changing longer words to :Zend\_&shy;Application\_&shy;Bootstrap\_&shy;Bootstrapper would add in breaks after every hyphen if required, emulating the behavior of some browsers.

Actually, I'm going to reformat this entirely to remove the tables in an upcoming iteration. Just need to decide on an appropriate docbook format and then implement.
