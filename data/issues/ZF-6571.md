I was trying to create a modular structure but i noticed zf doesn't add the new controllers to the module i tell it to if i don't pass the index-action-included=0/1

Here is some output:     mimir@orion:~/workspace/projects$ zf create project bdcms
    Creating project at /home/mimir/workspace/projects/bdcms

The problem is the provider receive string the argument (index-action-included=0) not the value (just 0). Just patch the code with file that I attach before.

Thanks.
