ZF-746: Port Zend\_Filter::isDate() to Zend\_Validate\_Date using Zend\_Date

### Description

The Zend\_Filter::isDate() method only allows one date input format as considered valid and does not take advantage of the Zend\_Date component. Instead of revising the method, I recommend creating such as Zend\_Validate\_Date, currently in the laboratory:

I thought I have coded this class and I should be asked/assigned to issues of Date/Locale and so on ??

Anyway... For checking if a date input is a proper date there are already functions:

Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate(); Zend\_Locale\_Format::isTime();

and additionally all integer values will be accepted.

So the rework of isDate is not that heavy... Of course I think not all input variants are supported by now, but about 90%-95% should do correct. So this will do it for a first release.

Pseudocode :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function isDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null) 
    {
        if (is_number($date)) {
            return true;
        }
    
        if (!Zend_Locale::isLocale($locale)) {
            // get default locale if not set
            $locale = new Zend_Locale();
            $locale = $locale->toString();
        }
    
        $result = Zend_Locale_Format::isDate($date, $format, $locale);
        if (is_array($result)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

Thanks, Thomas; I've committed what I hope to be approaching a solution for this issue based on what you've provided here:

[http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework_Laboratory/Zend_Filter/library/Zend/Validate/Date.php?r=44)

If this ends up being incorrect, as evidenced from future unit testing, we can open new issues as needed.

It's always a pleasure to help...

To mention: If something is wrong with the date-checking I would have to check this within Zend\_Locale\_Format as this is the generic date/time parsing function for the framework.

It's also used within Zend\_Date and Zend\_Calendar. So an error would also show up in these classes, not only in Zend\_Validate.

After chatting with Darby, I suggest either adopting something like Ralf's lightweight version of this class, or restricting Zend\_Validate\_Date to using Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() like this:

1) choose a default format of 'yMd' 2) avoid using locales 3) replace non-numeric characters from the input with 4) call Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate($inputString, $format, null);

See ZF-895 for a list of factors affecting use of Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate()
