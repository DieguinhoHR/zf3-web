### Description

A short time before 1.7 was released I started using ZF. Two small web solutions were been given to different customers and I had planned to upgrade to 1.7 as early as it was available. First I wasn't able to get it working, because I ran into errors related to class loading/creation by the autoload feature. Here's an example of the related file layout:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    abstract class ControllerBase extends Sfs_Controller_Base
    {
    ...
    }
    
    ?>


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    class IndexController extends ControllerBase
    {
    ...
    }
    
    ?>


When the IndexController is created by the dispatcher, the Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard::loadClass() fails, because ControllerBase.php can't be found by include\_once. That's because the value of the variable $dispatcherDir isn't prepended to the _includepath_ like it was done in zf1.6 by the Zend\_Loader::loadFile(). The old behaviour can easily be restored by following snippet inside loadClass (I think, that's why the $dispatchDir is still around).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    ...
        public function loadClass($className)
        {
    ...
    
            $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
            $loadFile    = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $this->classToFilename($className);
    
           // The necessary new line
        set_include_path($dispatchDir . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
    
            if (!include_once $loadFile) {
                require_once 'Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception('Cannot load controller class "' . $className . '" from file "' . $loadFile . "'");
            }
    ...
    ?>

Closing this as Wont fix for two reasons,

Firstly, controllers are not intended to be loaded in this manner, and are better suited in the library dir of your application, under a custom namespace.

Given the new resource loading in 1.8 onwards, making these autoload from this location would be a simple matter of adding a controller resource, and following the appropriate naming convention.
