ZF-4162: Zend\_Form::populate() accept an array of objects.

### Description

If you set the database adapter to return data as an array of objects and then try to populate a form with a database result it will throw an error:

$db->setFetchMode(Zend\_Db::FETCH\_OBJ); // set fetch mode $result = $db->fetchRow('...'); // get result $form->populate($result); // populate

Catchable fatal error: Argument 1 passed to Zend\_Form::populate() must be an array, object given, ...

whereas, if you don't set the fetch mode to return objects it's fine.

Would it be possible to add functionality to Zend\_Form::populate() so it accepts an array of objects?

Personally I don't get the usefulness of the feature, it will be simple to call $result->toArray() or to change the fetching mode...

@giorgio I agree.

This issue can be closed, it's a trivial to cast to array.

Closing based on user comments.
