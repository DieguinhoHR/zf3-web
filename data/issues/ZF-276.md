I'm not sure I understand this report. Can you provide a short code sample which demonstrates this?

Looking at the above code sample you are calling fetchAll statically but its not a static method.

See [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.fetchmultiple)

I still dont understand your problem :(

Your still calling Zend\_DB\_Table::fetchAll statically when its not a static method.

Perhaps posting a simple example showing how to fetch and echo all rows in a table would help.

The problem is in Zend\_Db\_Table::\_fetch(), this line in particular:

 
        // the WHERE clause
        $where = (array) $where;


When Superbiji uses empty string, $where becomes an array containing an empty string and Zend\_Db\_Table tries to make "WHERE [empty string] ORDER BY ...". If he was to use NULL, $where becomes an empty array and works correctly. He should be able to use empty string (or zero, or false, for that matter). Recommend changing the line to:

 
        // the WHERE clause
        if(is_null($where))
            $where = array();
        elseif(!is_array($where))
            $where = array($where);

Oops, I was obviously off with the fairies when I posted that fix (as it doesn't fix anything). Recommend changing to _this_ instead:

 
    <pre class="literal">
      // the WHERE clause
      if(empty($where))
        $where = array();
      elseif(!is_array($where))
        $where = array($where);

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

This is no longer an issue. The current default values for the fetchAll() arguments are null, so the proper usage would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    assert($table instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Abstract);
    $rowset = $table->fetchAll(null, 'name');
