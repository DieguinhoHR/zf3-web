### Description

Problem 1:

First the rfc states lines have a 76 character (encoded form) hard limit in length. This limit while implemented isnt working quite right. Lines regularily reach 80 chars.

This is due to the tack on of the =20 after the split (see second line) the other lines I think are over by one character but I might just be counting wrong.

IE:

man",Times,serif; color: #666; margin-bottom: 5px; line-height: 1.5em; borde= r-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px; }=0A=09=09h2 {=20= font-size: 14px; color: #666; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.5em; borde=

Problem 2:

= line endings, aka soft breaks.

Im not sure why, and I dont see in the RFC any explanation but my email clients all have a problem with the following line ending scenario

An encoded entity, followed by a softbreak, immediately followed by another encoded identity

Eg

=09=09US  
=0A=09=09=09=09=09Phone #: 1  
=0A=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09= =09

=0A=09=09=09=0A=09=09=09=0A=09=09=09=09= This will always result in an = sign being printed on the line below Phone #:1. My intutition is that if the following line begins with an identity, the soft-break = should be omitted, though I cant find anything in the rfc to back this up.
