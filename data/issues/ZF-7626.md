### Description

The update and delete methods both can accept an array in the format

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        array('id = ?'  => $id)


This is not well covered in the manual, which actually implies that it will simply concatenate the values together with AND statements. {quote} If you provide an array of strings as the second argument, these strings are joined together as terms in an expression separated by AND operators. {quote}

This should be covered, along with a use case example.

It may also be worth noting that the term (value) may also be a Zend\_Db\_Expr.
