### Description

PHPUnit 3.0.0 PHP 5.2.0 Xdebug 2.0.0rc1 Windows XPsp2

Enable Xdebug and invoke phpunit as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    phpunit --verbose --report html Zend_Controller_AllTests


Observe that the phpunit process take a very long time, utilizes a majority of CPU resources, and the process grows to ~280MB of RAM.

Comment out the following tests:

- FrontTest.php: testDispatch2()
- FrontTest.php: testDispatch3()
- Dispatcher/StandardTest.php: testDispatchValidControllerWithInvalidAction()

Run phpunit again, and observe that the test run completes relatively quickly.

I'm able to observe that the Dispatcher\_StandardTest you indicate takes a long time; the others go very quickly for me. I'll see if I can profile why this is occurring.

The FrontTest tests do finish a lot more quickly than the testDispatchValidControllerWithInvalidAction() test.

I just ran the tests again and the php.exe process grew to over 600MB in size. I had to kill the php process.

When I disable Xdebug, the tests complete reasonably promptly, even the Dispatcher/StandardTest suite. Obviously one wouldn't be running a real website with Xdebug enabled, but I have to run the unit tests regularly to monitor code coverage stats.

Bill -- the situation gets more and more odd. I've run with the xdebug profiler on both running the tests with the --report switch and without. Both give the same cachegrind output, which shows that that particular test case takes about 0.06% of the overall test time.

When running without the --report switch, the tests run very quickly -- basically the same speed as with xdebug profiling turned off. The only time I experience the delay is with the --report switch turned on, which indicates to me that the issue is with how PHPUnit and XDebug interact when generating the coverage report.

I don't think there's much I can do at this point. I'm attaching the cachegrind output I just generated when running reports for you to look at if so desired.

Cachegrind output of Zend\_Controller\_AllTests when run with --report switch

Since the issue only crops up when the --report flag is set, a condition that won't happen on production sites, marking as "Won't Fix".
