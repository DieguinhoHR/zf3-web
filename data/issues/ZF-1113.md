ZF-1113: Chapter 9.4.7. "Finding Rows by Primary Key" is incorrect

### Description

I quote:

"As a convienience, you can easily retrieve rows from the table using primary key values with the find() method. This method returns a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object if you attempt to find() only one key, or a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset object if you attempt to find() multiple keys."

This no longer appears to be true. $userEntry = $this->dbTable->find( $id ); // update some fields $userEntry->save( ); dies with the following message: Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset::save()

I can only assume that the find() method was changed to always return a rowset.

Correct. The find() method always returns a Rowset now. See ZF-21.

I'm working on a complete rewrite of the documentation for Zend\_Db\_Table and Row and Rowset today.

The rewrite was complete as of revision 4537, which puts it in the ZF 0.9.3 beta release.
