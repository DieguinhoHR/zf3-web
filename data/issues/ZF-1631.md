### Description

Unit tests need to be added to ensure that subclasses of Zend\_Gdata\_Extension properly handle constructor arguments. In general, this means making sure that all supported attributes are mapped to a constructor parameter and that whatever is passed in as an argument to that parameter is set as the valid for the associated attribute.
