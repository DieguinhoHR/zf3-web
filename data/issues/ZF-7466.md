### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector (262)

$module = '';

has to be:

$module = null;

If the module is an empty string, Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route :: assemble will add "/module" to the end.

Test case
---------

We have following route defined:

Forgot to add as info that we use following route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = $frontController->getRouter();
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
            ':language/:controller/:action/*',
                                            array(
                                            'language'   => 'en',
                                            'controller' => 'index',
                                            'action'     => 'index'
                                            )
                                            );
    $router->addRoute('default', $route);


To generate the error, you can use this controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action // extends BaseController
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $action = "test";
            $controller = "test";
            $module = "";
            $params = array();
    
            $redirector = new Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Redirector();
            $redirector->setUseAbsoluteUri(true);
            $redirector->setGotoSimple($action, $controller, $module, $params);
            echo $url = $redirector->getRedirectUrl();
        }
    
    }


this prints:

<http://localhost/en/test/test/module>

The "/module" in the end is unwanted and can be fixed by either setting $module = null; in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector (262) or by changing the check on $value to also exclude empty strings in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route (267).

I have noticed this in the 1.7.0 version at the client I'm at. I will check this evening and see if it's also an issue in the svn version and make a patch if needed.

I think You point following code (line 283-285 at ver.1.9.0):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($module == $dispatcher->getDefaultModule()) {
                $module = '';
            }

Correct.

I noticed that Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route has gone trough some changes in SVN.

So might be that this problem no longer exists. Will write a test app with the latest svn version over the weekend to verify this.
