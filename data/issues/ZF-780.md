ZF-780: Setting 'id' attribute for HelperCheckbox and HelperRadio doesn't work

### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement::\_getInfo() method is unsetting the id and next the helper method, eg. Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox::formCheckbox() is not setting the id, so setting id for checkbox and radio elements is not possible.

It could be fixed by adding this line after setting the name, and before setting the value:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    . ' id="' . htmlspecialchars($id, ENT_COMPAT, 'UTF-8') . '"'

The related issue 706 was partially fixed in 0.7.0, however checkboxes are still not working for me
