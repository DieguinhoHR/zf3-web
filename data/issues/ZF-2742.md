ZF-2742: Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() should be more strict when returning a class
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-27T17:06:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-26T11:29:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Example:

I have two view helper paths:

app/views/helpers (empty string prefix) Zfe/View/Helpers (Zfe\_View\_Helper)

I have a view helper class defined as Zfe\_View\_Helper\_DateTime in Zfe/View/Helper/DateTime.php

Since DateTime is already defined (internally by PHP), Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() returns 'DateTime', even though app/view/helpers does not contain a DateTime helper. This problem can be reproduced for any class that is defined prior to Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() being called.

I've added a test for this in r8445.

But I cannot duplicate your issue.. can you produce a test to demonstrate the issue?

Change the line where the helper path is set in the test to the following:

$view->addHelperPath(dirname(**FILE**) . '/View/\_stubs/HelperDir2', 'Zend\_View\_Helper'); $view->addHelperPath(dirname(**FILE**), '');

This should duplicate the bug.

Jordan,

I added matthew to this issue to have a look. It seems to me that having helpers without prefixes is not something i would consider "Best Practices". I would ask Matthew to comment on that.

On another note, wouldnt the code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    class Datetime
    {
        /* .... */
    }
    


Throw a fatal error about not being able to redeclare a class?

I'm not defining DateTime as a class. I'm defining Zfe\_View\_Helper\_DateTime, but since '' is a defined prefix for another helper path, it's finding a match for 'DateTime' there first, and ignoring my Zfe\_View\_Helper\_DateTime.

I think ultimately, the use case you talk about: "the ability to use helpers without a prefix" is something that will continually get you in trouble since its hard to know what base classes will be included in php, and by other applications and/or code. I think the best thing to do is always use helper prefixes.

After discussing with Matthew, I think that perhaps we should check to make sure a non-empty helper prefix is passed with all helper (and basePath) calls.

I have a related issue (should I file it as a new bug?):

Helpers without a prefix do not work properly at all.

Assume a Helper called FunkyHelper in a file FunkyHelper.php with the "helper method" public function funkyHelper($a, $b, $c). Zend\_View\_Abstract::getHelper($name) does a "new $class()", in this case "new FunkyHelper()" and FunkyHelper::funkyHelper() is called as a php4-style constructor. As funkyHelper($a, $b, $c) expects three parameters this results in an exception.

That's why I think empty helper prefixes should not be allowed.

Empty helper prefixes have been disallowed in 1.5.

In 1.6, the helper system inside Zend\_View\_Abstract will be replaced with Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader (much like in Zend\_Filter\_Inflector as well as the usage you see in Zend\_Form). In general, not having a prefix is both a bad practice as well as confusing. The naming structure we have (pseudo-namespaces/PEAR naming conventions) is the only thing we have until php gets real namespaces.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Fixed in 1.5 branch
