And how should the array adapter know which language the translation has? I think that you missed something in your workflow.

Hi Ramon,

this is probably no bug! You have to assign a language/locale to the adapter to get it working as expected. You can pass the locale as second parameter. Zend\_Translate\_Adapter will then add your array to the assigned locale.

best regards

Thomas

Before of the release 1.10.3 this code worked correctly.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new Zend_Translate_Adapter_Array(array('message' => 'Foo'));


After of the release 1.10.3 was need of change to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new Zend_Translate_Adapter_Array(array('content' => array('message' => 'Foo')));


Since already Thanks ;).
