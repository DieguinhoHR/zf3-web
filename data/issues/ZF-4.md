For sake of completion, we can move some of the key old ones over before we get to 1.0 beta.

I know of no proposals in svn at this time, so this must have been resolved long ago.

The proposals were removed in [changeset 1194](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=1194)

Maybe we could resolve this by documenting how to resurrect the old proposals from SVN and/or attaching an archive of the files to the wiki?

Attached old proposals to [proposals home in wiki](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/Lw).
