### Description

I try to send a html email like that:

- - - - - -

$mailer = new Zend\_Mail('utf-8'); $mailer->addTo(...); $mailer->setSubject(...); $mailer->setBodyHtml('.....', 'utf8');  
 $mailer->setFrom(...);

$mailer->send();
----------------

When i receive this mail in gmail everything is good i can see html page. But when i receive this mail using apple mail i see the html content becoming an attachment.

Hi

Currently I had a similar problem with Windows Live Mail 2008/9 but after testing many different configuration I could fix it: -> mail.add\_x\_header = Off in php.ini

I don't no if this was the bug described here "http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48620" or if this is an bug/feature of the Mail Client. But if it is activated the Client breaks parsing Mail after this Header and display the source starting on this position.

Hi, xinghao.

Do you use Chinese language with Zend\_Mail? If so , I will be happy if you try followings.

1) set encoding hz-gb-2312 (GB2312) or Big5 instead of UTF-8 to Zend\_Mail().

2) setBodyText(mb\_convert\_encoding($txt, 'YOUR ENCODING', mb\_detect\_encoding($txt)) , $charset , $encoding );

I will close this because no responce for one month or more. It seems to be client-dependent problem for me.
