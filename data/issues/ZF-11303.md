### Description

This is a clone of ZF3313 which was solved for 1.6 and reappeared from 1.10.6 and still isn't fixed.

The default translator used by all forms may be set by calling:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Then, when $form->isValid is called, each of the element validators have their translators set to that same default translator (if they don't have a translator explicitly defined).

This works fine, if you want to use the same error message for every validator instance of the same name. For example, NotEmpty, the validator automatically created by $element->setRequired(true), uses the key 'isEmpty' for its error message. If 'isEmpty' is mapped to a string in the default translator, it will be picked up and used as the error message when a value is not supplied for that field (element) of the form.

However, it is more-likely the case that in a large application, different fields will require different error messages when they are left blank. This is no problem if you're not relying on a translator. Each of those NotEmpty validator instances can be given customized messages by calling setMessage on them.

But in that case, the translator stops working, seemingly because of an oversight in the implementation:

(for this example, assume $messageKey has the value 'isEmpty') \_createMessage in Abstract.php line 191:

 
        $message = $this->_messageTemplates[$messageKey];
    
        if (null !== ($translator = $this->getTranslator())) {
            if ($translator->isTranslated($messageKey)) {
                $message = $translator->translate($messageKey);
            }
        }


But what if the developer has specified:

 $password->addValidator('NotEmpty', true); $password->getValidator('NotEmpty')->setMessage('form.login.password.errBlank'); ```

with the following line in en\_US.php:

 
        'form.login.password.errBlank'    => "Please enter your password."


The above code in Zend Framework's Abstract::\_createMessage will output only the translation key as the error message ('form.login.password.errBlank').

Detaching Zend\_Validate from the list of problematic components.

Note: From the point of a translator giving a key is bad behaviour because of the above mentioned problem... no translation results in an unrecognised key instead of a meaningfull message

Sorry, I am new to Zend\_Form, so I will reassign automatically
