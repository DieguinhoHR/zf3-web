### Description

When using the array adapter (not sure if it happens with other adapters), if you have multiple language files distributed over multiple folders and more than one file has the same index for a translate element ZF "chooses" one of the files and uses it, often generating wrong translations. For an example, if I have:

application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml and application/views/scripts/contact/index.phtml

and I have my language files like this:

application/languages/en/US/index/index.php and application/languages/en/US/contact/index.php

and both language files return a 'title' index, I may end up with the wrong 'title' translated. I believe Zend\_Translate should look for sources based solely in folder/file structure, connecting views and language files.

You misunderstood how translation works: There is no way to have two identical messageIds translated into two different translations.

Example: When you write in your code...

translate('Title');

and the same in another file then the messageId 'Title' is used for both files.

On the other hand, when you have the messageId 'Title' in two different files then you will not know which of them will be used because the used adapter is responsible for this.

There is no way to support this as translations are not related to the path of a file, but to the text which has to be translated.

To have a solution you must use different messageIds: For example 'Title\_Index' and 'Title\_Contact' when you are not using real content. Because when you have "My Title" in two files, the translation is for both files equal.
