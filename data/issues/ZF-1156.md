### Description

Hi,

I think that a great improvement for table relationship would be to store and be able to access to the dependent rows within parent row object.

with the example of the manual we could have :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $tableAccount = new Accounts();
    $anAccount = $tableAcount->find(1)->current();


and have in the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object a detection of accessor like following that would fetch and store the dependent rows on the first call (and maybe also with a refresh method) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    same idea with parent rows :


in a second time we could imagine to be able to update dependent rows not only for primary key changes if using the where clause generated from the referenceMap (already implemented in the findDependantRowset). For example we would be able to add a dependent row for a parent row object :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $newBug = $tableBugs->fetchNew();
    $newBug->bug_description = 'a description';
    $newBug->bug_status = 'OPEN';
    ...
    $aProduct->dependentBugs->add($newBug); 


This last call could set the product\_id value in $newBug if Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset had stored the where clause used to fetch it (so with primary key value of the parent row)

Then ``` would add the new bug for this product;

I'm aware that it implies quite major modifications but I think this is really a must have functionality.

This is a pretty fancy new feature. I have changed the issue type to 'new feature'.

This is part of being an object-relational mapping (ORM), and Zend\_Db\_Table has a long way to go to provide that functionality. The scope of work for Zend\_Db\_Table is to provide the Table Data Gateway and Row Data Gateway patterns, not a fully features ORM.

That would be a really great product, but we cannot do this in the short term with Zend\_Db. I will leave the issue open though and perhaps someday we will do it.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db
