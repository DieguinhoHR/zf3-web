### Description

You can check out <http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html> for more information.

Especially useful is activemq.prefetchSize which sets prefetch size for current consumer. It helps to implement parallel message processing ([http://activemq.apache.org/what-is-the-prefetch-li…](http://activemq.apache.org/what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for.html), [http://activemq.apache.org/i-do-not-receive-messag…](http://activemq.apache.org/i-do-not-receive-messages-in-my-second-consumer.html)). There is no other way to set this parameter via Stomp protocol.
