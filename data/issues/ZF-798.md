### Description

Modular directory support is not optimal at this time. In the 0.7.0 release, it is basically impossible to use when using any sort of module namespacing. Additionally, it is leading to improper coupling of classes that breaks the 80/20 rule.

The recommendation at this time is to subclass those components that need module awareness in order to create a module-aware controller chain. The request object will retain knowledge of modules to simplify this task, but the router and dispatcher will both be subclassed to have Module versions. This will promote code re-use and serve to illustrate methods and rationale for subclassing to support custom features.

Revision 3004 contains the implementation, and includes new documentation for using conventional modular directories with the MVC classes.
