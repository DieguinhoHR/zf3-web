ZF2-453: Logger xml formatter not accepting arrays (from extra params)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

taken from rtfd: $writer = new Zend\\Log\\Writer\\Stream('<a>php://output</a>'); $formatter = new Zend\\Log\\Formatter\\Xml(); $writer->setFormatter($formatter);

$logger = new Zend\_Log(); $logger->addWriter($writer); $logger->info('informational message');

This causes an array to string conversion notice error in the xml file line 157: $elt->appendChild(new DOMElement($key, (string)$value));

The extra params are passed as an array. I think this code comes directly from the config xml writer, as that suffers from exactly the same problem.

Hi Thomas,

I've made the pull request cause if I used your code example.

I didn't get the notice, but got this as a result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2012-08-09T9:42:33+02:006INFOinformational messageArray

When I tested with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $logger->info('informational message', array('extra_key' => 'extra value'));


The output was the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2012-08-09T9:42:33+02:006INFOinformational message

I had a look at the code, and the extra options are, as far as I could see, implemented for the errorHandler and the ExceptionHandler, but not for XML.

Cause the empty didn't seem right, I did a pull request for not showing this in the xml output.

Did you test it on the latest ZF2 from git? Do you still get the notice?

PS. I've also did a pull request to update the documentation for the right example ( $logger = new Zend\\Log\\Logger(); ) on [http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/…](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/modules/zend.log.formatters.html)
