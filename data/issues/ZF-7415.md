### Description

Web host uses mysql.domain.com as host instead of localhost so connection fails when localhost is subbed for mysql.domain.com. A test for the correct user information was done using mysql\_connect which resulted in success, however when the same information was subbed in to the Zend\_Db::factory the same vars resulted in no connection.

Web host is Dreamhost

What exception/error do you get?

It may be an issue of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysql, I think from the description, so I set component and auto reassign.

Closing this issue because to the extent that it makes sense, we're not able to reproduce it.
