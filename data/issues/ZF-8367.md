### Description

Hello,

Maybe it's not a bug, but in this case, it's a question.

Some days ago, I tried to display a duration (in seconds) with Zend\_Date. I had some problems to represent it correctly since it was not related to a unix timestamp.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    include('Zend/Date.php');
    
    $seconds = 90;
    
    echo 'Seconds : ' . $seconds . PHP_EOL;
    $date = new Zend_Date($seconds);
    echo 'Should display 00:01:30' . PHP_EOL . PHP_EOL;
    
    echo 'Timezone Europe/Brussels (UTC+1)' . PHP_EOL;
    $date->setTimezone('Europe/Brussels');
    echo $date->get('HH:mm:ss') . PHP_EOL;
    
    echo 'Timezone Europe/London (UTC+0)' . PHP_EOL;
    $date->setTimezone('Europe/London');
    echo $date->get('HH:mm:ss') . PHP_EOL;
    
    echo 'Timezone UTC' . PHP_EOL;
    $date->setTimezone('UTC');
    echo $date->get('HH:mm:ss') . PHP_EOL;
    


Here is the output :

Seconds : 90 Should display 00:01:30

Timezone Europe/Brussels (UTC+1) 01:01:30 Timezone Europe/London (UTC+0) 01:01:30 Timezone UTC 00:01:30

Indeed, to have the correct representation, you have to use ->setTimezone('UTC');

So, so strange as it is, for Zend\_Date, Europe/London is not the same as UTC. I do not understand why.

AFAIK and on Wikipedia, Time zone GMT (UTC0) - Summer (DST) BST (UTC+1)

But even if I add Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('fix\_dst' => false)); in the beginning of the script, the result is not yet good.

Is it normal or is it a bug ?

Thanks !

Cheers,

Raphaël

Sorry but you're completly wrong:

UTC is a timezone which does not have any DST.

Europe/London on the other side is identical to GMT+0 which DOES take DST into account.

Note that there is no UTC+1 but there is a GMT+1

Hello,

Ok, but then, why the Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('fix\_dst' => false)); does not fix the thing?

Thank you

Cheers,

Why should it?

According to manual: {quote} 14.4.1.2. DST and Date Math When dates are manipulated, sometimes they cross over a DST change, normally resulting in the date losing or gaining an hour. For exmaple, when adding months to a date before a DST change, if the resulting date is after the DST change, then the resulting date will appear to lose or gain an hour, resulting in the time value of the date changing. For boundary dates, such as midnight of the first or last day of a month, adding enough months to cross a date boundary results in the date losing an hour and becoming the last hour of the preceding month, giving the appearance of an "off by 1" error. To avoid this situation, the DST change ignored by using the fix\_dst option. When crossing the Summer or Winter DST boundary, normally an hour is substracted or added depending on the date. For example, date math crossing the Spring DST leads to a date having a day value one less than expected, if the time part of the date was originally 00:00:00. Since Zend\_Date is based on timestamps, and not calendar dates with a time component, the timestamp loses an hour, resulting in the date having a calendar day value one less than expected. To prevent such problems use the option fix\_dst, which defaults to TRUE, causing DST to have no effect on date "math" (addMonth(), subMonth()). Use Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('fix\_dst' => false)) to enable the subtraction or addition of the DST adjustment when performing date "math".

If your actual timezone within the instance of Zend\_Date is set to UTC or GMT the option 'fix\_dst' will not be used because these two timezones do not work with DST. When you change the timezone for this instance again to a timezone which is not UTC or GMT the previous set 'fix\_dst' option will be used again for date "math". {quote}

I don't see you crossing a DST... you just changed the timezone of an existing date object without doing any calculation.

fix\_dst does only prevent problems with calculation by crossing a DST border when people are not aware of real time calculations.

Closing as non-Issue
