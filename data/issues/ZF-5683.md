### Description

Most DB has its own error number, when an exception happens. In my project, I want to get its own error number to do some operations, but using Zend\_DB,

I can't get it. So I suggest adding a natrual DB number, when throwing a DB exception.

for example: library\\Zend\\Db\\Statement\\Mysqli.php line 215

 
         before:
         throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli_Exception("Mysqli statement execute error : " . 


$this->\_stmt->error);

 
         after:
         throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli_Exception("Mysqli statement execute error : " . 


$this->\_stmt->error, $this->\_stmt->errorno);

To adapte all DB, we can create a suit of error no. for Zend\_DB, and map them to different DB error no. in 'Exception file'.
