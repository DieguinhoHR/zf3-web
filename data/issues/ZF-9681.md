ZF-9681: <rss> in view or controller method results in the method being called twice
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It seems that as soon as Zend notices the tag, it re-renders the method.

Echoing the following in the controller: echo $this->minutes;exit; -method successfully called once echo ''.$this->minutes.'';exit; -method successfully called once echo ''.$this->minutes.'';exit; -method called twice!

Even if you put inside the view template, or in the method, somehow its calling the method again.

Your browser is calling your action for unknown reasons, either way this is not a ZF bug, unless you can provide a more detailed explanation.
