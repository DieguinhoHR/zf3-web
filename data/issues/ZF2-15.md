ZF2-15: Ignore, fixed in 2.0.0dev2 Zend/Mail/AbstractProtocol.php fails to load Zend/Validator/Hostname.php

### Description

Creating a new smtp transport with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new \Zend\Mail\Transport\Smtp('hostname', $config)


results in an error: Warning: include\_once(Zend\\Validator\\Hostname\\Hostname.php) [function.include-once]: failed to open stream...

The reason is that Hostname.php is located in Zend\\Validator and not in Zend\\Validator\\Hostname. I solved the issue by hacking Zend\\Mail\\AbstractProtocol.php constructor:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //before:
    $this->_validHost->addValidator(new HostnameValidator\Hostname(HostnameValidator\Hostname::ALLOW_ALL));
    //new:
    $this->_validHost->addValidator(new Validator\Hostname(Validator\Hostname::ALLOW_ALL));

I was using 2.0.0dev1, the bug is solved in 2.0.0dev2. Sorry for wasting your time by reporting a bug in old version.
