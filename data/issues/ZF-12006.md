### Description

The Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_FlashMessenger has a static variable '$\_messageAdded', which is never changed. In ZF2, this issue is resolved by $\_messageAdded to true after adding a message.

Does this solve any particular problem with the ZFv1 flash messenger? The code has changed considerably v1->v2, so is backporting this change appropriate?

After reviewing the suggestion more closely, this is indeed a bug, but it's side-effect is trivial (setExpirationHops is called on each addMessage call instead of just the first)

Fixed in trunk (1.12.0): r24813
