### Description

_scenario_

i have chained namespaces in the following way:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Level1_
    Level1_Level2_
    Level1_Level2_Level3_
    ...


all the namespaces are correctily registered at Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader with their respective paths.

_problem_

when i ask for the class Level1\_Level2\_Level3\_Some the autoloader activates the namespace Level1\_ instead of Level1\_Level2\_Level3\_

_possible solution_

the following sollution worked for me:

1. in file Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php replace the lines 338-340 with:
 

    <pre class="literal">
    if (false === $namespace
        || (strlen($ns) > strlen($namespace))
    ) {
        $namespace   = $ns;
        $autoloaders = $this->getNamespaceAutoloaders($ns);
    }


1. in file Zend/Loader/Autoloader/Resource.php replace the line 148 with:
 

    <pre class="literal">
    $namespace = array();
    $topLevelSegments = count(explode('_', $namespaceTopLevel));
    for ($i = 0; $i < $topLevelSegments; $i++) {
        $namespace[] = array_shift($segments);
    }
    $namespace = implode('_', $namespace);

I don't get this, could you clarify why you'd need to add a namespace for Level1\_ and Level1\_Level2\_?

Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader does not have path mapping to namespaces, only the resource loader does this!

As for the resource loader, that will work fine for such a situation (look at the models/mappers for Model\_Mapper in the module resource loader)

i've implemented chained modules support on my application. for that, the submodules' identificator is a chain of their hierarchy. for example, the module HR (Human Resources) - Curricula - Admin has the key hr\_curricula\_admin.

why does submodules is needed? 'cause inside human resources i have financial control, horary control, salary control. as each one has it's own permission control and controllers and views, it seems to me more likely a submodule than a parameter to a more-general-purpose module.

yep, but it do deals with namespaces -- even the mapping namespaces-paths residing at resource loaders -- and in a way wich does not support more than one level.

{quote} As for the resource loader, that will work fine for such a situation (look at the models/mappers for Model\_Mapper in the module resource loader) {quote}

the fact is that Model\_Mappers is not treated as a chained namespace, but as a component and resource type inside Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource.

for default, Zend allows me to map Hr\_Model\_Mapper because Hr is the namespace and Model\_Mapper a resource autoloader's component, such as Model\_DbTable, Form, Model, Plugin and so on. if i need Hr\_Curricula\_Model\_Mapper where Model\_Mapper is still a component and Hr\_Curricula the namespace, autoloader fails.

To fully understand this, I had to write unit tests - which is what was missing from your report. As such, I was able to understand the issues, which were:

- The autoloader stops searching at the first namespace that matches a class, even if a more specific autoloader exists
- The resource autoloader assumes only a single segment namespace -- which means it will fail if the resource namespace is multi-segment.

I've added tests and patched the library files in trunk and the 1.11 release branch at this time.
