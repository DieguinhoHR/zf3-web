should be $this instead of $stmt

in Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle fetchAll() could be completed by

Add after line 311 case Zend\_Db::FETCH\_COLUMN: $flags |= OCI\_ASSOC;

But i dont know exactly what format is expected from listTables()

Simple patch. I dont have access to an oracle db server so if someone could test and confirm it works I would be grateful

Not enough, you have to update Oracle.php in Statement too... I will add patch to do it.

With your patch and the one i gi ve, the bug is fixed.

Applied patch. listTables() test runs, though it still gets a wrong result for different reasons.
