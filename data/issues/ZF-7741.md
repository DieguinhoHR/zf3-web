ZF-7741: Add useragent setter to Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-08-31T14:59:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:33.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Helper classes for Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient (such as Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin) offer constructor parameters to set an application's useragent for use when making requests. However, there is no easy way to set this without using a constructor parameter, and no such parameter exists for Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient.

Instead, users must build a config array and call setConfig(). This is non-obvious, and results in a low number of applications setting their useragent.

Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClinet should offer a (possibly mandatory) useragent setter.
