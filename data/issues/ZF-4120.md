ZF-4120: Zend\_Translate lacks support for plural forms
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-29T08:36:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-08-29T10:29:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

As described in the GNU documentation of gettext (see: [http://gnu.org/software/automake/â€¦](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/gettext/Plural-forms.html)), languages can have different number of plural forms and also vary in how the plural forms are used. This is part of i18n and thus should be solved by Zend\_Translate itself. I know that not all adapters could support that, but at least the gettext has a fixed definition of the "Plural-Forms" header.

I assume this issue as critical, because currently there is simply no option to translate plural forms without doing it hard-coded in your application code, which limits one to romanic and germanic languages.

I would absolutely love this feature.

This is a duplicate of ZF-2400.
