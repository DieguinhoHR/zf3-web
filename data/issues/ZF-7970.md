### Description

I got problems with generating PDF containing latin2 (ISO-8859-1) or Cyrillic (ISO 15924) characters.

This is code I use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // setup font
    $pdfPage->setFont( $font = Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName(Zend_Pdf_Font::FONT_HELVETICA_BOLD ), 16 );
    
    // and then add some text
    $text = "These characters does't work: ąĄ śŚ ćĆ źŹ żŻ łŁ ęĘ ńŃ"; // Polish (latin2) chars
    $pdfPage->drawText($text, 20, 700, 'utf-8');


The problem is with Zend\_Pdf\_Resource\_Font\_Simple::encodeString() which converts text to CP1252 (where is no Polish or Cyrillic chars):

```

Result PDF contains: "These characters does't work:" (all non latin1 chars are missing)

Hope my code helps to debug issue.

Greetings, Dominik Bułaj

I believe the problem ultimately is that the built-in PDF fonts only support latin1 characters. Try using a .ttf or .otf font file that supports utf-8 characters.

Yes you are right. Using ttf font I was able to print Polish chars. Thank you.
