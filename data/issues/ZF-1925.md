Hi there, I have a similar error. In the mail body every 60th to 75th (seems random) character is replaced with an equal sign "=". ItÂ´s a hard coded plain text body without special characters.

i think you can close this issue. I understood that were some problems with Zend\_Mime and now are resolved... Zend\_Mail is working fine now...

Hi - I am still getting EXACTLY this problem - I am using Zend Framework 1.0.2, and I also got the latest Mail and Mime from the nightly build dated 11/10. Interesting is this shows only in my web mail, not in MS Outlook which shows it fine. Below is the problematic mail. Any ideas? What can I try to address this? Thanks.
