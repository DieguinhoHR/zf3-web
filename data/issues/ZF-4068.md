ZF-4068: Enforcing content\_type\_memorization (when it is switched on) in Zend\_Cache

### Description

Currently Zend\_Cache can cache a blank page that has no content-type. This can occur when the website redirects the user without disabling the cache. The simplest way to solve this is to enforce content\_type\_memorization (when it is switched on).

The easiest way to do this is below:

In Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page, with in the IF statement: if ($this->\_specificOptions['content\_type\_memorization']) { The cache should check that it has a content\_type to memorize. This can be done with:

 
        // Do not cache without content-type 
        if ($contentType === null){
            return $data;
        }

please have a look at 1.6.0 RC

"content\_type\_memorization" is now deprecated and replaced by a more generic option "memorize\_headers"
