ZF-8665: Docblocks in several Zend\_Measure\_Abstract methods contain specific, rather than general, types

### Description

In the DocBlock for the method Zend\_Measure\_Abstract::setValue(), the $type parameter is described as:

@param string $type OPTIONAL A Zend\_Measure\_Acceleration Type

I can't imagine that we want the specific "Zend\_Measure\_Acceleration". The $type required here is just the index into the \_units array. We just want to give an example. I imagine we just need something like:

@param string $type OPTIONAL The type of the value. Ex: Zend\_Measure\_Acceleration::GALILEO

Similarly, the docblock for the constructor itself contains a reference to a specific type:

@param $type type - OPTIONAL a Zend\_Measure\_Area Type

Probably better is:

@param string $type OPTIONAL The type of the value. Ex: Zend\_Measure\_Area::SQUARE\_METER
