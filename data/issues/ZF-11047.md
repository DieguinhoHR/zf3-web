### Description

This code fails for any locale except en\_EN and en\_US.

 
        $value = '3238.8250';
        $locale = new Zend_Locale('ro_RO');
        $number = Zend_Locale_Format::getNumber(
            $value,
            array(
                'locale' => $locale,
                'precision' => 0,
                )
        );

You are giving ro\_RO as locale. Romania defines the dot as grouping and the colon as decimal character.

This means that a value like 123.456 is detected as integer 123456 and a value like 123,456 as float 123.456.

Additionally the number pattern is defined as #,##0.### This means that grouping must occur in every 3 digit or that no grouping is available. But in your case the grouping is in every 4 digit.

For ro\_RO this means that following behaviour:

||original||output||type|| |123|123|integer| |123.456|123456|integer| |123,456|123.456|float| |123.456,789|123456.789|float| |1234.5678|exception|exception|

Therefor closing as non issue
