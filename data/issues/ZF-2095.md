### Description

Zend Search suddenly caused error becaues it searchs for ".del" compound file while my index just contains ".sti" & ".cfs" My PHP got eAccerelator and I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with that since I found another link with the similiar issue here <http://eaccelerator.net/ticket/248>

Note: I temporarily fixed the issue by commenting the code that check for ".del" in Search/Index/SegmentInfo.php around line 206

That looks like eAccelerator doesn't catch exception if it's actually inherited from the specified class (Zend\_Search\_Lucene code tries to catch Zend\_Search\_Exception exception object when it's actually Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception) .

It doesn't matter which type of exception to catch, so changing caught exception type to Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception should resolve the problem. But it's still a bug in eAccelerator.
