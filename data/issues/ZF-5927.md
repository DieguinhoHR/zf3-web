### Description

The second parameter for oci\_fetch\_array() is hardcoded, when calling this function inside Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle::fetch(). As a result when the fetchMode property of the database adapter is set to any of Zend\_Db::FETCH\_NUM, Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ASSOC, Zend\_Db::FETCH\_BOTH or Zend\_Db::FETCH\_BOUND the returned row doesn't contain the columns that have null values.

Maybe this can be made configurable (of course Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle class can be extended and the fetch() method overridden, but I think it would much nicer to allow client code to specify additional flags for the second parameter of the oci\_fetch\_array() function.

The problem code is written below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    switch ($style) {
                case Zend_Db::FETCH_NUM:
                    $row = oci_fetch_array($this->_stmt, OCI_NUM | $lob_as_string);
                    break;
                case Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC:
                    $row = oci_fetch_array($this->_stmt, OCI_ASSOC | $lob_as_string);
                    break;
                case Zend_Db::FETCH_BOTH:
                    $row = oci_fetch_array($this->_stmt, OCI_BOTH | $lob_as_string);
                    break;
                case Zend_Db::FETCH_OBJ:
                    $row = oci_fetch_object($this->_stmt);
                    break;
                case Zend_Db::FETCH_BOUND:
                    $row = oci_fetch_array($this->_stmt, OCI_BOTH | $lob_as_string);
                    if ($row !== false) {
                        return $this->_fetchBound($row);
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    /**
                     * @see Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle_Exception
                     */
                    require_once 'Zend/Db/Statement/Oracle/Exception.php';
                    throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Oracle_Exception(
                        array(
                            'code'    => 'HYC00',
                            'message' => "Invalid fetch mode '$style' specified"
                        )
                    );
                    break;
            }

Exactly the same for me today. Ralph, I will correct this like I already did for LOB\_AS\_STRING. But in my idea, default state is activation of OCI\_RETURN\_NULLS and deactivation if needed. What do you think about it?

I got in to the same problem as listed above, but this does not affect version 1.6.0 or 1.6.2

I agree with Mickael Perraud, that OCI\_RETURN\_NULLS should be set by default and deactivated if needed.

I will still use 1.6.2 until this is fixed :S

Fixed in SVN 14241 and merge back to 1.7 branch in SVN 14242

With correction of ZF-5146, I exchanged oci\_fetch\_row and oci\_fetch\_assoc with oci\_fetch\_array. The normal behaviour of oci\_fetch\_row and oci\_fecth\_assoc is to return null for empty field but not for oci\_fetch\_array. This behaviour wasn't cover by unit test. This is now ok with SVN 14241.
