ZF-11842: Hashing uses own implementation instead of using Zend\_Crypt
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_OpenId::digest() seems eerily similar to Zend\_Crypt::hash() - why have two implementations performing the same desired behavior?

I'm working on resolving this, patch is forthcoming.
