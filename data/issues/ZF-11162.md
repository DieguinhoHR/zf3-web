ZF-11162: Zend\_Http\_Client::setUri mutates argument
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client::setUri (and therefore the constructor) mutates the passed Zend\_Uri\_Http object by changing the port number if it is not set to the default. Furthermore, setting parameters etc, will mutate the originally passed argument too. Imho this shouldn't be the case, the passed argument should be const, and if Zend\_Http\_Client wishes to adopt the instance, it should be cloned.

I'll be providing a patch and a test here.
