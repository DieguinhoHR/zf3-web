ZF-7977: Request to Zend\_Rest\_Server providing correct method name but wrong args faults without explicit message
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-29T13:51:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-01T02:34:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Calling a method Zend\_Rest\_Server and not specifying all its required argument faults with message like: "Invalid Method Call to getNearestAirports. Requires 6, 4 given. failed"

It would be better for client of the service to know what exactly argument names server expects when call faults due to bad method arguments, like: "Missing Arguments: googleApiKey, onlyImportAirports"

The Testcase for this fix only tests one of the two added behaviours. Also the original test sucks, please add more tests for this!
