### Description

I'm getting the same problems as described in <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8432>

Is there something I can do to get you more information, it seems to be doing the same thing, although the code doesn't look wrong, it is finding a magic file database correctly, finfo just fails when it finds one.

It seems that some \*nix distributions deliver a broken mime database.

The only way to get around this problem is to give a own database when non of the automatically found database and also the internal used database is broken.

The detection itself has changed with ZF-9278. But a broken database will still be a problem as finfo does not work without database.
