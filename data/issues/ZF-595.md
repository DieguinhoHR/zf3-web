ZF-595: @return self breaks Zend Studio's code completion feature
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2006-11-25T05:48:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:30.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

I.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Singleton instance
     * 
     * @return self
     */
    public static function getInstance()


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $controller->...


Zend Studio's (5.2.0) code completion can not determine the type of $controller and will not show the members of Zend\_Controller\_Front. A change to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     * @return Zend_Controller_Front


will fix this trivial but annoying issue.

There are lots of "@return self" in various classes of the incubator's Zend/Controller directory. Also some files of XmlRpc and View are affected.

Another minor typo in the method declaration of Zend\_Controller\_Front::getDispatcher()

change @return Zend\_Controller\_DispatcherInteface <- add \_ and r to @return Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.

Resolved in revision1918. Fixed in Controller, View, and XmlRpc trees.
