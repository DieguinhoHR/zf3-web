ZF-6660: Zend\_Gdata\_App autoloading bug with class\_exists
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-14T13:46:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-06-23T18:17:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.0 (31/Jul/09)

### Description

r15576 introduced the following bug:

if (!class\_exists($name . '_' . $class)) { require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; echo 'test'; @Zend\_Loader::loadClass($name . '_' . $class); }

which causes things to fail as the class\_exists triggers the autoloader to load the class if an autoloader is registered. It should be !class\_exists($name . '\_' . $class, false) to disable autoloading when checking if the class exists.

Jeffrey, What do you mean by "causes things to fail"? What is the failure you're experiencing?

I've created a new Zend\_Gdata object, let's call it My\_Gdata\_App

I've registered My\_Gdata\_App however when I use the newAppEntry method, which is processed by a magic \_\_ method in Zend\_Gdata, it attempts to load the My\_Gdata\_App \_Entry object from various places. The problem occurs when it checks to see if my extension exists. The class\_exists() call invokes the autoloader automatically so I end up with a Zend\_Loader::include() error (for My/Gdata/App/Extension/Entry.php) because it can't find the file it was looking for. Not finding it was the expected result since the correct path is in the second loop (My/Gdata/App/Entry.php), but it can't loop since it failed in the first loop.

Basically the if statement itself creates a situation where the code in the brackets will never run since the class\_exists will trigger the Zend\_Loader to try and load the file to see if it exists. You just need to add the "false" as the second argment to prevent class\_exists from invoking autoloading, then your code will load it as necessary.

oh, and ignore the echo 'test'; bit in the original bug, that was me to see if the if statement ever executed.

        ZF-6660: Disable class_exists() autoloader in Zend_Gdata_App::__call() and
        Zend_Gdata_Gapps::__call() for compatibility with magic factories.
        
        This corrects a bug that was introduced by r15576.
