### Description

Section 18.5.5. "Adding Filter Class Namespaces" of the Zend\_Filter\_Input documentation should be updated to reflect the new addFilterPrefixPath and addValidatorPrefixPath methods introduced in 1.5.0. Currently, it only states that addNamespace is available, which has been depreciated since 1.5.0.

Reading the docs, this appears to be resolved already.
