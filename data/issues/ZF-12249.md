### Description

say, $form->addElement('text', 'field-name', $options); Then, the element can be retrieved by $form->field-name. However, $form->field-name->getName() == fieldname.

The reason is that Zend\_Form\_Element will filter ($name) before setting it. However form still has it in Zend\_Form::$\_elements[].

The side effect of this is that when doing $form->isValid($post). This field will lost track of posted value.
