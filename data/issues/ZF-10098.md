ZF-10098: Form field labels not rendered
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-07-02T09:02:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-07-30T14:22:32.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend Framework in versions 1.10.x is not rendering the labels for some form fields.

This did work properly in 1.9.x versions: (label was rendered)

 
        $form->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_Text('NumFactura'));
        $form->NumFactura->setLabel('Número factura:');


While it doesn't in 1.10.x versions (label not rendered)

Though, I have to say:

1- it works for some fields in the form (not for all) 2- this alternative seems to work properly in 1.10.x:

 
        $form->addElement('text', 'NumFactura', array('label' => 'Número Factura:'));


The problem happens with 1.10.4, 1.10.5 and 1.10.6

I'm running PHP Version 5.2.6 on Windows Vista

2010/07/08 More specific information about this issue:

I've suddenly realized that this is an issue with labels that have accents: for example, it doesn't work with "Población" as a label either. But, it does work with "Poblacion"

This issue also happens with the list of values in a select field: those with accents don't appear in the list. They are in the selectable list but no item characters are shown

As I said before, it worked fine in 1.9.x versions though.

I've been trying to find changes related to this behaviour in version 1.10 documents, but couldn't find any.

Here is an unit test: (Zend\_Form\_Element\_TextTest)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @group ZF-10098
     */
    public function testRenderingWithAccent()
    {
        $this->element->setLabel('Bogotá, μέρος');
        $this->element->removeDecorator('HtmlTag');
        $this->element->getDecorator('Label')->setOption('tag', null);
    
        $expected = 'Bogotá, μέρος'
                  . PHP_EOL
                  . PHP_EOL
                  . '';
    
        $this->assertEquals(
            $expected,
            $this->element->render(new Zend_View())
        );
    }


Result: "OK (4 tests, 5 assertions) - Process finished with exit code 0"

@Oriol I think you have a problem with character encoding.
