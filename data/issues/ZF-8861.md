### Description

Tested the functionality of isDate() with the following (basically a number that IS divisible by 100 but NOT by 400):

$date = '29 February 1500'; // could try 100, 300, 700

if ( Zend\_Date::isDate( $date,'dd MMMM yyyy', 'en' ) ) { print "  
String $date is a date"; } else { print "  
String $date is NO date"; }

returns: String 29 February 1500 is a date But it SHOULD return false? divisible by 100 but NOT 400 ?

According to: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap\_year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) -- "..Years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless they are also evenly divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years."

UNLESS - there is something that I dont understand about leap years and when they were implemented historically /etc.

What I was using for the logic in my own code was:

class CalendarDTO { private $\_calendar\_year, $\_is\_leap\_year, $\_calendar\_months ;

 
    ...
    
    public function setIsLeapYear( $year )
    {
        /*
         * IS it a leap year?  *POSSIBLY*
         * year is divisible by 4..
         * so it *IS* a leap year well.. ( maybe )
         */
        if( $year % 4 == 0 )
        {
            $this->_is_leap_year = true ;
    
            /*
             * The year is divisible by 100..
             * so it is *NOT* a leap year.. well.. ( maybe )
             */
            if( $year % 100 == 0 )
            {
                $this->_is_leap_year = false ;
                /*
                 * BUT the year is also divisible by 400
                 *  so it IS a leap year after all
                 */
                if( $year % 400 == 0  )
                {
                   $this->_is_leap_year = true ;
                }
            }
        }
        // is NOT a leap year
        else
        {
            $this->_is_leap_year = false ;
        }
    }


}

So it is very possible that I am clueless on the implementation of Leap Years and when they came into affect... etc.

Closing as non-issue.

You can't execute Gregorian date functions on Julian dates. The wikilink is not wrong... it just doesn't note some points on gregorian dates in general.

This may give you a hint:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian\_calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) {quote} The Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar.[1][2][3] It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582, a papal bull known by its opening words Inter gravissimas. {quote}
