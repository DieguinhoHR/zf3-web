### Description

If you use a Zend\_Service class which uses the Basic auth capabilities of the Zend\_Http\_Client prior to using Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3, then you can end up two conflicting Authorization headers in the request to S3. In order to fix this, the S3 class could run $client->setAuth(FALSE) just after $client->resetParameters(). Alternatively, Zend\_Http\_Client::resetParameters could reset $this->auth to null.
