### Description

When using a custom row class in a class that extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, like such:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    class MyTable extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        protected $_rowClass = 'MyRowClass';
    }

    <pre class="literal">
    Index: library/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php
