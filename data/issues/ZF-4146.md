ZF-4146: Wrong array conversion position
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-01T01:48:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T23:32:53.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Since the latest change (r11114) a bug in Zend\_Locale became visible: the extraction of the locale from an array in Zend\_Locale::\_prepareLocale() depended on !$strict. With the latest change this error became apparent because the added strpos() might now operate on an array and issue a warning. The attached patch fixes the wrong behaviour.

This is not a bug.

Strict is default false. You can only set it to true when you use isLocale.

Setting isLocale()'s strict to true means that it checks for real existing locales and will do no rerouting. Strict does not allow the use of automatic locales like 'browser' or 'auto' because these are only computed but no real locales.

Changing the code would lead to to the problem that rerouting is allowed and also the behaviour that only real existing locales are allowed would be corrupted.

And how does the explanation say anything about the reported bug? \_prepareLocale() accepts an array as locale parameter. These array is converted to a locale string like so: $locale = key($locale). After the conversion strpos() is called with $locale as a parameter. As the array conversion is only done in non-strict mode, strpos() issues a warning about an array passed as an argument.

    $ cat locale-example.php
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Locale.php';
    var_dump(Zend_Locale::isLocale(array('foo'), true));

    $ php locale-example.php

Warning: strpos() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /home/lstrojny/Projekte/ZendFramework/trunk/library/Zend/Locale.php on line 795

Warning: strtr() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /home/lstrojny/Projekte/ZendFramework/trunk/library/Zend/Locale.php on line 796 bool(false)

And looking at the API doc you see the the locale parameter can only be a string or an instance of Zend\_Locale when calling isLocale().

This is not a bug because it is not allowed to give an array as locale parameter.

Than why does \_prepareLocale() handles arrays anyway and does not throw an exception if something else than a string is given?

Because internally arrays are used to store the autolocales. And the second is performance.
