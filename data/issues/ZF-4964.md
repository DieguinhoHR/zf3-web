ZF-4964: Zend\_View does not listen to helper paths correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There is a BC break between 1.6.2 and 1.7 where the helper paths are instantiating the correct helper.

Example: Project\_View\_Helper\_Translate Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate

When the controller is setup the view helper is being set by calling the parent to set the helper paths and then adding on the helper path after. When the $this->translate is called in the view it is picking up the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate instead of the Project\_View\_Helper\_Translate.

The helper path is listed last in the array of helper paths when calling getHelperPaths.

NEW: I've looked through our code and seemingly found where this takes place. Is that it will initialize the helper prior to the last action being instantiated thus not following the specific path. This bug is irrelevant.
