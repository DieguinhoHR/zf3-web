ZF-2109: toString() sometimes returns wrong year on last day of the year
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $zendDate = new Zend_Date('2007-12-31', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    echo $zendDate->toString('YYYY');


The code above outputs the wrong year "2008", while getIso(), getYear() or the implizit \_\_toString() all have the correct year 2007.

I tried the same for the years from 1000 to 3000, and the only affected years are the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">1901, 1902, 1906, 1907, 1912, 1913, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1923, 1924, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1934, 1935, 
    1940, 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1951, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1974, 
    1975, 1979, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2012, 
    2013, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2024, 2025, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2035, 2036

Maybe some sort of rounding bug?

Tested with version 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and the latest nightly snapshot

'Y' is the year as defined within ISO8601.

ISO defines that the year begins with the first week where the thirsday is in this year. This is correlating to the week and is normally used for calendar display.

If you need the real-year you should also use the real year "y" and not the ISO year "Y".

This is no failure or bug... the class works as defined. Please refer to the documenation for details about the used constants.
