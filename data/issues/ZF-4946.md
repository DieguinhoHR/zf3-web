### Description

Add the possibility of including functions and native javascripts expressions to be encoded by Zend\_Json, generating right syntax in the outputted json. The main idea is follow the Zend\_Db\_Expr pattern, so to include a Javascript Expression to be encoded in an object/array, will be enough to uses something similar to Zend\_Json\_Expr('javascript expression').

Moved from incubator to trunk in r14399, scheduled for 1.8 release

Benjamin, checking the actual implementation of this, I find the next problem:

Using Zend\_Action\_Helper\_Json, or Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json it is not possible to pass the $options['enableJsonExprFinder'=>true] up to Zend\_Json::encode method, making this Helpers unuseful if you want to encode expressions. I mean, I am using the Zend\_Action\_Helper\_Json::sendJson method because it is quite direct way of sending Json as response to an Ajax frontend. This Helpers chain the next actions until arrives to Zend\_Json:

1.- Zend\_Action\_Helper\_Json::sendJson($data, $keeplayouts) this calls to -> 2.- Zend\_Action\_Helper\_Json::encodeJson($data, $keepLayouts) this calls to -> 3.- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json::json($data, $keepLayouts) this->calls to -> 4.- Zend\_Json::encode($data) without other params as cycleCheck and options for encode method.

It would be useful to allow enabling Json Expr Finder from Helpers. I find 2 ways of doing this:

1.- Including an optional 3rd param in the Helpers: Zend\_Action\_Helper\_Json::sendJson($data, $keepLayouts, $optionsForEncodeMethod) and the same in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json, so Zend\_Json::encode can receive it. This will suppose to change a few methods and classes

2.- Doing enableJsonExprFinder a static prop in Zend\_Json, so before using Helpers, if you want to enable Expr Finder, can include Zend\_Json::enableExprFinder = true

What do you think?

Let's go with option one. I'd change this slightly, however, and overload the second parameter to the helper. If a boolean, then it sets the keepLayouts flag; if an array, then it uses that array to set options (and allows passing the keepLayouts option via that array).

Time Worked: 1 hour

Recode of Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Json and Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json to allow pass options up to Zend\_Json::encode (as enableJsonExprFinder=>true) is done.

I have tried to do a Test of it, but including Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json "breaks" my unitTesting, so I couldnÂ´t do it.
