### Description

When I try to execute a stored procedure in a (postgres) database, if any of the arguments contain a period, the \_uniqueCorrelation() method thinks this is a correlation indicator, even if the string contains parentheses which should convert it to an expression.

This code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public String getFoo()
    {
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM new_user ('Robert', 'Marley', 'jah@love.ire')";
        $select = $this->select();
        $select->from($sql, '*');
        $stmt = $this->getAdapter()->query($select);
    }


produces this assemble error:

 
    <pre class="literal"> Warning: Select query cannot join with another table in 
    /var/www/html/library/Zend/Db/Select.php on line 1222


and the select object looks like:

 
    <pre class="literal"> object(Zend_Db_Table_Select)#182 (5) {
      ...
      ["_parts:protected"] => array(11) {
        ["distinct"] => bool(false)
        ["columns"] => array(1) {
          [0] => array(3) {
            [0] => string(5) "ire')"
            [1] => string(1) "*"
            [2] => NULL
          }
        }
        ["union"] => array(0) {
        }
        ["from"] => array(1) {
          ["ire')"] => array(4) {
            ["joinType"] => string(10) "inner join"
            ["schema"] => string(50) "SELECT * FROM new_user ('Rob', 'Marley', 'jah@love"
            ["tableName"] => string(5) "ire')"
            ["joinCondition"] => NULL
          }
        }
      }


Expected results should be:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        ["from"] => array(1) {
          ["SELECT * FROM new_user ('Rob', 'Marley', 'jah@love.ire)"] => array(4) {
            ["joinType"] => string(10) "inner join"
            ["schema"] => NULL
            ["tableName"] => string(55) "SELECT * FROM new_user ('Rob', 'Marley', 'jah@love.ire)"
            ["joinCondition"] => NULL
          }
        }


If I wrap it in an expression:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public String getFoo()
    {
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM tms_create_user_api ('Robert', 'Marley', 'jah@love.ire')";
        $select = $this->select();
        $select->from(new Zend_Db_Expr($sql), '*');
        $stmt = $this->getAdapter()->query($select);
    }


then the \_join() method runs $this->\_uniqueCorrelation('t') with the following results:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        ["from"] => array(1) {
          ["t"] => array(4) {
            ["joinType"] => string(10) "inner join"
            ["schema"] => NULL
            ["tableName"] => object(Zend_Db_Expr)#182 (1) {
              ["_expression:protected"] => string(56) "SELECT * FROM new_user ('Rob', 'Marley', 'jah@love.ire')"
            }
            ["joinCondition"] => NULL
          }
        }


which looks like it should work, but I get the same error. I can run this thing from the Zend\_Db\_Adapter->query() method which, happily, works; but, there is nowhere to specify the schema this way other than gluing it on the front of the sql string, so that's why I wanted to get the select() to work.

I cannot trigger the warning in question, that might in fact be from the database you are using?

Ideally, I would like to see a couple of things:

-1) information on the database you are using, adapter and so on- 2) the target query you think Zend\_Db\_Select should be producing

If you still find the issue, please reopen with above information. Thanks!

Edit: I see you are using Postgres, but I still need the target SQL you are attempting to build, and ideally, some kind of scheme i can compare it against.
