ZF-3988: It should be possible to set the number of session expiration hops of Zend\_Form\_Element\_Hash

### Description

When you are working with AJAX applications, it could be that you will request a form with the hash element. And after that, it could be that the application requests another page, like the latest headlines. But then you will have a problem, the hash element does use a Zend\_Session\_Namespace that will expire after one hop. But, with an AJAX application, there could be a lot more hops before the form is filled out and sent.

So, this should be adjustable as an option for Zend\_Form\_Element\_Hash.

A working patch.

This should be fixed at this point; we changed to namespace hops instead of request hops -- meaning that unless you actually query the hash session namespace, it will persist.
