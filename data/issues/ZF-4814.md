### Description

Hi, PHP developers.

I have been developing several web-sites with Zend FW. ( template engine : Smarty )

I developed a few web-sites with "raw Zend" as it was. But, I felt few shortcomings in controller part. - in case that controller class contains many actions, controller class files' size became to be large. - In many cases, action functions wasn't relative to each other. - It was inconvenient to process common works like as authentication and etc.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, I have modified some classes related to Zend controller so that promote actions to CLASS level. I made action classes derived from Zend\_Controller\_Action.

Each action classes has three functions, which charges some works respectively. These functions are executed by dispatch function of Zend\_Controller\_Action. Please, refer to following codes.

 
    /**
     *  Authentication process before main process.
     *
     *  @access public
     *  @return string  LocationPath(null : normal, false : stop next process)
     */
    public function authenticate()
    {
        /* check whether the request is available, or not */
        return null;
    }
    
    /**
     *  Preparing process before main process.
     *
     *  @access public
     *  @return string  LocationPath(null : normal, false : stop next process)
     */
    public function prepare()
    {
        /* input check and convert input data automatically */
        return null;
    }
    
    /**
     *  Main Process
     *
     *  @access public
     *  @return string  LocationPath(null : no forwarding )
     */
    public function perform()
    {
        /* major process : db access, ... */
        return null;
    }
    
    /**
     * Dispatch requested action. Called by Zend_Front_Controller
     * 
     * @return void
     */
    final public function dispatch()
    {
        // Notify helpers of action preDispatch state
        $this->_helper->notifyPreDispatch();
    
        $this->preDispatch();
        if ($this->getRequest()->isDispatched()) {
            // preDispatch() didn't change the action, so we can continue
            if( ! $this->_forwardAction( $this->authenticate() ) )
            {
                if( ! $this->_forwardAction( $this->prepare() ) )
                    $this->_forwardAction( $this->perform() );
            }
    
            $this->postDispatch();
        }
    
        // whats actually important here is that this action controller is 
        // shutting down, regardless of dispatching; notify the helpers of this 
        // state
        $this->_helper->notifyPostDispatch();
    }

While I appreciate your effort here, I fail to see anything here that is not already possible with the combination of action controllers, action helpers, and existing components. If you feel strongly about these ideas, I encourage you to create a proposal in the wiki so that you can gather community feedback.
