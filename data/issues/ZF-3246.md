### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getUrlDetails($url) {
            $parms = array('hash' => md5($url));
            
            $res = $this->makeRequest(self::JSON_URL, $parms, 'json');
            
            if(isset($res[0])) {
                return $res[0];
            } else {
                return null;
            }
        }


Also, this doesn't conform to code standards (function bracket must be on a new line, spaces instead of tabs).

I have fixed a coding standards problem in revision r9638, but I can't find a missing bracket. There is no syntax error in file Delicious.php.

I am marking this issue as fixed.
