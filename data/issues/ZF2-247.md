### Description

There is actually : - SimpleRouteStack, deconnected of the current request - TreeRouteStack, use the current request, but save childs routes, plugin, and the match use offset.

Why not a Route between SimpleRouteStack & TreeRouteStack ? At work, we use always static (or regex route sometimes), not tree or thing like this, performance will be better. Why not Http\\SimpleRouteStack, which know current request, so no problem to generate canonical url, and don't use tree or plugin etc ...

You don't have to use tree routing when using the TreeRouteStack. Also, please don't claim that performance is better here or better there without supplying any benchmark.
