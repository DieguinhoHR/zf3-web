This happens because the Location value returned by this server is broken (invalid, has space in it which is not URL-encoded).

While this is not strictly a bug (since the server is buggy, not the client), this is definitely something we can modify to handle better, but the change has to be in Zend\_Uri first. The Zend\\Uri for ZF 2.0 is already designed to handle this gracefully.

If there is an elegant way to handle this without breaking BC, I will look into it. If not this will be fixed in ZF 2.0

For redirects use only, I made function with splitting url paths and url\_decode/url\_encode for each part and connecting again. It doesn't brake Zend\_Uri logic, but works
