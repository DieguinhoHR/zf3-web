### Description

Configuring Zend\_Cache via an INI file runs afoul of parse\_ini\_file() - used in Zend\_Config - which translates a value of NULL to an empty string. This prevents setting the Zend\_Cache\_Core lifetime to NULL except manually. To fix this, Zend\_Cache\_Core should interpret any empty value as being equivelant to NULL. This imposes no breaks in behaviour (that is intended) but will break behaviour where empty strings were used either by intent or accident. The scope of the latter is not considered, in my opinion, worth preserving since it serves no actual purpose.

On a separate note, the Zend\_Cache tests have no test for a NULL value anywhere.

I'm having trouble with this patch. In development environment I use a lifetime setting of zero in the ini file.

I've spend a lot of time debugging to try and find the error I got. Seems to be my lifetime of zero in my cache.ini file. Setting it to 1 resolved this problem, but I think this isn't a proper solution.

because:

empty("0") validates to true, it's set to NULL.

Better is: (string)intval($value) != $value
