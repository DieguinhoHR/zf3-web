 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-04T14:55:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-19T12:58:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

The method looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        final protected function _hasParam($paramName)
        {
            return null !== $this->getRequest()->getParam();
        }


And it should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
         final protected function _hasParam($paramName)
         {
            return null !== $this->getRequest()->getParam($paramName);
         }

This is a duplicate of ZF-679, which was fixed in revision 2536.

Duplicate of ZF-679, already resolved.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
