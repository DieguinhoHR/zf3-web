ZF-11907: Validation of a Multicheckbox
---------------------------------------

### Description

When validating an element, we first check "if ($isArray && is\_array($value)) {" on Zend\_Form\_Element line 1389, then you loop on the rows of $value.

Ok but like this, how can we check if there's at least or at most X checkboxes checked?

Is this a bug report or a question? It looks like a question!

Please use the [mailing lists](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Mailing+Lists) if you need support.

Actually as I don't know wether it was expected not to be able to validate the multicheckbox element and not only its options, it could be both question and bug. So I've put it here.

If it's expected, then ok, it's just not convenient at all and I'll check for help on the mailing lists, but if it's not, well at least people knows now.

This is very easy: use the standard validator [Callback](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.set.html#zend.validate.set.callback).
