### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't optimize query yet. It should transform query to most simple form and it's designed to do this, but this feature is not implemented yet. Implementation of this feature may give the same result as boolean queries optimization (most queries may be transformed to term/multi-term queries).

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query::rewrite() method is used for this. Each query should know, how to rewrite itself in simple form.
