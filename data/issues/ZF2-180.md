### Description

when adding element like $this->addDisplayGroup( array ('el1', 'el2' ) ) it does: unset($this->\_order[$element]); Elements are rendered only from $form => displayGroup->render()

but when adding elements $this->getDisplayGroup('dgBottom')->addElements(array($el, $el2)); $el & $el2 are still in $this->\_order[] and they are rendered as form elements \*and\* as elements from displayGroup

DisplayGroups are no longer a part of the forms API starting with beta4 (forms were re-written).
