ZF-7536: Content of index.php does not follow coding standard

### Description

In the documentation, the content used for index.php uses an alternative short syntax for the if control statement mixed with the alternative OR/|| syntax following a statement that equates to FALSE. Not all readers will be familiar with this syntax and it's quite confusing compared to the usual if () {} elseif () {} else {} form which is far more legible and assists understanding what's going on when setting up the APPLICATION constants.

First, it would have been nice to know where exactly in the documentation you were referring to -- I had to hunt a little. :) (Code in question is in documentation/manual/en/module\_specs/Zend\_Application-QuickStart.xml)

Second, this is not a coding standards violation; the code conforms to the ZF CS just fine. Your comments are more regarding readability of the provided code.

I understand your concerns, but there are two things to weigh here: readability, and conciseness.

For those reading this not familiar with the lines of code in question, they are:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Define path to application directory
    defined('APPLICATION_PATH')
        || define('APPLICATION_PATH',
                  realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../application'));
    
    // Define application environment
    defined('APPLICATION_ENV')
        || define('APPLICATION_ENV',
                  (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION_ENV')
                                             : 'production'));


To make it more readable, I might write:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!defined('APPLICATION_PATH')) {
        // Define path to application directory
        define('APPLICATION_PATH',
               realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../application'));
    }
    
    if (!defined('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
        // Define application environment
        if (getenv('APPLICATION_ENV')) {
            define('APPLICATION_ENV', getenv('APPLICATION_ENV'));
        } else {
            define('APPLICATION_ENV', 'production');
        }
    }


The two are equivalent. My personal preference is for the former, because it's more concise, and the provided whitespace offsets it more cleanly visually from the code it precedes. The "||" usage is not often seen in PHP, but is a standard idiom in other languages, and a very fast way to decision. Finally, I prefer the fact that define() is only called in a single line rather than multiple lines in the case of the APPLICATION\_ENV variable.

The second has the benefit of using very recognizable control structures, making the flow easier to read -- but looks slightly more bulky and less fluent.

I'm okay with modifying the code to use the second syntax, but, honestly, I've not heard any complaints about it other than this one.

Developers familiar with JavaScript should not have a hard time with this syntax. As Matthew stated, this syntax is not only more concise but is also used quite a lot (we have many Polyglot programmers in our PHP developer community after all).

I believe it would be fair to close this issue.
