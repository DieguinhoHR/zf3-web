ZF-3656: Element::getDecorator() issues a substr\_compare() warning

### Description

When the name of the decorator to retrieve is shorter than one of the decorators in the array, the following warning is issues:

Warning: substr\_compare() [function.substr-compare]: The length cannot exceed initial string length in E:\\repositories\\openads\\private\\adconsole\\zend-ui-spike\\library\\Zend\\Form\\Element.php on line 1553

To fix that, a check could be done on the lengths before calling substr\_compare():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getDecorator($name)
        {
            if (! isset($this->_decorators [$name]))
            {
                $decorators = array_keys($this->_decorators);
                $len = strlen($name);
                foreach ($decorators as $decorator)
                {
                    if (strlen($decorator) >= $len && 0 === substr_compare($decorator, $name, - $len, $len, true))
                    {
                        return $this->_decorators [$decorator];
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
            
            return $this->_decorators [$name];
        }

Please pull from current svn trunk and let me know if this issue still persists; it shouldn't exist any longer, as getDecorator() has been refactored in the past few weeks to allow for lazy-loading, and this algorithm has been changed.

Please post a comment with the results of using svn trunk so I can determine whether to close the issue or continue work on it.
