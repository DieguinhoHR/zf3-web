### Description

Add a cookie using the setHeaders() function, then add another cookie using setCookie() - they end up being a single value

Reproduction code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Http/Client.php';
    
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setHeaders(array('cookie' => 'are you'));
    $client->setCookie('funky', 'monkey');
    
    echo $client->getHeader('cookie'); // will output "are youfunky=monkey; " instead of "are you; funky=monkey; "

Fixed in revision 12425. Added a check if cookie seperator is present in the string, if not, add it.

will need to review this patch, there are hard coded values in tests as well as underscores in test name.

(I will fix this this week, but will keep it assigned to you)
