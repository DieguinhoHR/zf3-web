Actually, there's really no reason to do so. My original thought on the matter was that it was a PHP limitation -- that we were mapping namespaces directly to PHP classes as a 1:1 mapping. However, that's not the case -- the namespace maps to a class, but they do not have to match.

Please file an issue in the tracker for this. In the meantime, simply extend Zend\_Json\_Server locally, and override the method that does the namespace check.
