ZF-4381: SOAP headers

### Description

At the moment the client hides SoapClient's SOAP header functions/calls, which are needed in a lot of SOAP applications.

Could these be added in some form?

SoapClient accepts SOAP request headers in its SoapClient->\_\_setSoapHeaders() function, and both request and response ones in its more advanced SOAP calls SoapClient->\_\_soapCall()

I think that the priority should be higher than Minor. As the reporter notes, lots of SOAP applications require headers, and the lack of this functionality prevents the use of Zend\_Soap\_Client for these applications.

Done.
