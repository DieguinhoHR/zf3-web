### Description

When I implement the exemple of Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page in the boostrap file, the cache ID is never generated, therefore the cache is never hit.

I figured out that it does work when deleting "Cookie" in the foreach statement of \_makeId() function in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page.
