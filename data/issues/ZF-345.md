### Description

Message from Irwin:

- - - - - -

I've created an index with Java Lucene version 2.0. When I tried to open the index with Zend Framework version 0.1.5, I got the following error message:

(ioppenhm@chinaski-71) ~/wp/genindex: php search.php Index contains 659388 documents.

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception' with message 'Wrong TermInfoIndexFile file format' in /home/ioppenhm/zend/library/Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php:322 Stack trace: .... Does this mean that Zend Lucene is NOT compatible with Java Lucene 2.0? I also tried to open an index that was created by PyLucene (which is compatible with Java Lucene 2.0) and got the same results. BTW. both indices were fully optimized.

Which versions of Zend Lucene are known to be compatible with Zend Lucene?

Best regards, Irwin Oppenheim Amsterdam, The Netherlands

PHP fseek() function takes PHP integer (C long) as an input for offset. Thus largest file offset, which can be used on 32-bit platform is ~2Gb.

I made necessary changes (and committed them into SVN) to give correct error messages instead of 'Wrong file format'. This code should also work proper on 64-bit systems.

Theoretically, it's possible to emulate large seeks by several smaller... But a) it will slow down execution for common indices b) ftell() and filesize() returns int as a result and also don't work with files which are large then 2Gb.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
