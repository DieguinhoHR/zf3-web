### Description

See: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45288>

Zend\_Loader::loadFile() cannot effectively use the $dirs argument in affected PHP versions (as of 2008/6/26: 5.1.2, 5.2.5-6), because the include\_path state cannot be changed.

This method and argument is used throughout the Framework, including Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard, rendering the MVC inflection useless.

This behavior was changed for 1.7.0; the previous include\_path is cached using get\_include\_path(), allowing us to reset it following the include.
