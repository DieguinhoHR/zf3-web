ZF-3074: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract update and delete function improvements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, there is no way to specify additional bind parameters for the where clause of the functions update and delete. This leads to a mess of $adapter->quoteInto()'s on complex where conditions.

Could the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract be extended to include an additional optional array parameter which would include the bind parameters for the where clause?

I have had to fork the entire Zend\_Db namespace in order to implement this myself, as without this feature, these two helper functions become fairly unusable.

I will try to include a patch file of the changes needed if the tracker will let me.

Here's the patch. As you can see there is not much work needed to implement this.

Sorry, I just noticed my patch has a slight problem in it. The $params array\_merge should be typecasted to array as the array\_merge will fail on a null parameter.

I have signed the CLA, and been confirmed.

I've included a patch of the changes from the current trunk (r11898) needed (a bit better written this time), along with added tests for the extra parameters.

I've run the tests using the pdo\_mysql and mysqli adapters.

Is there anything else I can do to speed up getting this fix into the next minor release?

If you can't complete this, can you assign it to someone who can? It is a trivial change that should take a miniscule amount of time, especially when I have done the tests which have passed for me. It shouldn't still be incomplete over 6 months after the issue was opened.

I will look into this issue tomorrow, after I read through the patch and understand the feature request, I'll email you back to start a discourse.

Ok, thanks.

I've had a look through the issue tracker, and there appears to be several duplicate requests, although some requesting a different format:

ZF-3129 - Same request, bind parameters are additional function arguments. ZF-2863 - Alternative notation of an associative $where array ZF-651 - Suggests Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract update/delete improvements as well

I'll include a patch containing changes to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract as well (they just pass through the bind parameters).

I've made two test cases for that as well. I wasn't sure whether to expand on these tests, as the adapter tests cover them. I wasn't able to see if these tests worked, as for some reason my test setup ignores the tests/Zend/Db/Table/TestCommon.php tests.

Will evaluate within 2 weeks with the rest of the Zend\_Db issues i have marked.

Have any decisions been made on this issue? Would you like me to submit a new patch based on the latest trunk?

 

 

Posted by Andy Thompson (at465) on 2009-07-30T13:21:22.000+0000

Please, is there anything else that needs doing to get this under way? I've done the patch and the tests.

Is there any decision that needs to be discussed?

Ok, I just noticed since ZF 1.8, \_whereExpr has been updated to allow associative arrays, which the ZF-2863 issue mentions, so I guess I'll have to go with that. Could all these issues be closed as they no longer apply?

 

 

Posted by Andy Thompson (at465) on 2009-08-01T06:20:18.000+0000

On second thoughts, trying to apply the associative array method of where expression doesn't fit all situations, e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    UPDATE table SET field = "value" WHERE condition1 = "5" OR condition2 = "9"


There would be no way to do this, as the \_whereExpr always joins the conditions with AND.

The way I've suggested will allow for simple quoting into where conditions of any complexity, and conform to the same style as query()

e.g. for the above

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update('table', array('field' => 'value'), 'condition1 = ? OR condition2 = ?', array(5,9));


I'm not suggesting removing the \_whereExpr associative array, but adding this will allow more advanced updating.

Or ideally maybe something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()->where('condition1 = ?, 5)->orWhere('condition2 = ?', 9);
    $db->update('table', array('field' => 'value'), $select);


 

 

Posted by Ryan Mauger (bittarman) on 2010-11-19T06:09:01.000+0000

This has been available for some time now with the following syntax

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update('table', $data, array('foo  = ?' => $bar, 'baz = ?' => $bat));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->delete('table', array('foo  = ?' => $bar, 'baz = ?' => $bat));


These bindings can also be used with Zend\_Db\_Expr

closing as no longer an issue.

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'not an issue' don't need a fix version -- it makes them appear in the JIRA changelog and/or roadmap.
