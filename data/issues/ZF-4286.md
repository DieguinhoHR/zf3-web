ZF-4286: PHP warning in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract->\_connect()
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2008-09-14T06:17:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-13T14:10:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.0 (17/Nov/08)

 Attachments: - [zend\_mail\_protocol\_abstract-warning.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/11547/zend_mail_protocol_abstract-warning.patch)
 
### Description

The call to stream\_socket\_client() should be prepended with an @-sign to avoid warnings on connection timeout and probably also on other errors.

Kind regards, Thomas Gelf

Warnings are not enabled in production. Thus hiding a warning IMO only makes development harder.

You didn't even look at the source before closing this, did you?

The \_connect() function checks whether opening the socket failed and throws an exception if so. Exceptions are fine and can be catched, native PHP warnings are absolutely useless here and would keep filling up my logs. Not every productional PHP code is a web application - I have a lot of code executed by various cronjobs and daemons, all of them running with E\_ALL and E\_STRICT enabled. If some warning appears our sysadmins immediately get a notification by mail.

Cheers, Thomas

As you've set this ticket to "unassigned" without any comment I took some time to reread "ZF coding standards", just to be sure. Regarding "Errors and Exceptions" they clearly state:

"The Zend Framework codebase must be E\_STRICT compliant. Zend Framework code should not emit PHP warning (E\_WARNING, E\_USER\_WARNING), notice (E\_NOTICE, E\_USER\_NOTICE), or strict (E\_STRICT) messages when error\_reporting is set to E\_ALL | E\_STRICT."

Even if the "should not" is not enforcing it for me this point is pretty clear and no further discussion is needed.

I'll change this ticket to be reassigned automatically and also change priority and type - it's not an improvement, it's a coding standards violation.

Best regards, Thomas Gelf

Attached patch file for current SVN.

Probably the best situation here is to use error\_get\_last() when throwing the exception indicating that opening the stream failed. I think the patch Thomas has, combined with that information, would fit both criteria. (error\_get\_last() will get the last error message, even when error suppression occurred).

Thank you, Matthew! However: error\_get\_last() isn't required, stream\_socket\_client() is already writing errors to $errorStr, and this error is thrown as Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception in case of an eventual error.

stream\_socket\_client() now got the shutup operator.

I also did take a look at the additional options. error\_get\_last() might give a message if there is a possibility for stream\_socket\_client() to fail without a warning. Would be better to add that to Zend\_Exception. It would also help with all other suppressed warnings, as no component uses or returns that information yet.

Writing a test for this task would mean using a error\_handler, as I couldn't find an other way to know if a warning was raised, but suppressed. Not worth it.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
