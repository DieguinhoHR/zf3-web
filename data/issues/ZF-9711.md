### Description

Hi,

it seems to me there is a bug in Zend\_date related to leap years earlier than 1900. The problem occurs only with February days.

I construct a date: $myDate = new Zend\_Date('25/02/1824', 'dd/MM/YYYY');

Then I display it using a different format:

echo $myDate->toString('YYYY/MM/dd');

The result is: 1824/02/26

The day is changed !?!?

I made several tests, and it seems to me that this problem occurs only with dates of February month in leap years before 1900.

Are dates earlier than 1900 are supposed to be supported by Zend\_Date ? Did I miss something (explicitly configuring something, like timezone ... ?)

UPDATE: I posted a test file to reproduce the problem. The code is:

<?php defined('APPLICATION\_PATH') || define('APPLICATION\_PATH', realpath(dirname(**FILE**) . '/'));

set\_include\_path(implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, array( realpath(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/library'), get\_include\_path())));

require\_once 'Zend/Date.php';

$strInitialDate='25/02/1824'; $myDate = new Zend\_Date($strInitialDate, 'dd/MM/YYYY'); $strFormattedDate= $myDate->toString('YYYY/MM/dd');

echo "Initial date ('dd/MM/YYYY'): ".$strInitialDate; echo "\\n"; echo "Formatted date ('YYYY/MM/dd'): ".$strFormattedDate; echo "\\n";

Thanks Philippe

Not reproduceable

Please give a full output like described within the FAQ and not only toString (dMY), otherwise it is not possible to reproduce your problem

Hi,

find enclosed a test file to reproduce the issue.

The output should be: Initial date ('dd/MM/YYYY'): 25/02/1824 Formatted date ('YYYY/MM/dd'): 1824/02/25

But actually, the output is:

Initial date ('dd/MM/YYYY'): 25/02/1824 Formatted date ('YYYY/MM/dd'): 1824/02/26

The problem occurs both in development and production environments.

Closing as not reproducable

Using your test example the result is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Initial date ('dd/MM/YYYY'): 25/02/1824
    Formatted date ('YYYY/MM/dd'): 1824/02/25


which is correct and shows no problem at all

So it's a complete mystery for me ...

In my two different environments, I still have the problem I described ..... ?! I've just tried with the 1.10.3 version, and I have the same result.

I also tried changing the way I construct the date, like this:

$datearray = array('year' => 1824, 'month' => 2, 'day' => 25); $myDate = new Zend\_Date($datearray);

and the Zend\_Date object still "considers" that the date is the 26 of February !!!!

A mystery ....

@Thomas: I think it could be something similar to ZF-9349. I reproduce his bug with 1.10.1 but not with current trunk.

 

 

Posted by stabiloo (stabiloo) on 2010-04-22T03:36:53.000+0000

@Mickael and Thomas: I confirm that the patch #21753 released for ZF-9349 solves the problem.

I didn't find it by myself: thank you Mickael, and sorry for disturbing !!! ;-)
