ZF-1832: Zend\_Date::setWeekDay wrong result for a week overlaping 2 years

### Description

Test code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
         function test_week_zendsetweekday()
         {
            $date = new Zend_Date('2006-01-01','YYYY-MM-dd', 'en');
            $date->setWeekday(1);
            
            $this->assertEqual('2005-12-26', $date->toString("Y-m-d"));
         }


Expected result : '2005-12-26'

Actual result: '2006-01-02'

I couldn't find a fix as the date class is fairly complicated. This bug is a critical bug.

Edit: My version of a setWeekday(1)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if( $date->toString('N') > 1)
    {
            $date = $date->subDay($date->toString('N')-1);
    }

Just for completeness... Your testcode would never work ! "Y-m-d" returns YEAR - MINUTE - DAY instead of year-month-day...

Fixed with SVN 6105

Thomas, I actually do this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array('format_type' => 'php'));


For the story Im planning to stop using zend\_date as it is way too slow for my use (like creating 365+ dates which takes too much time considering the work one date object has to do (checking locale, etc...)) But I guess Zend\_Date is perfect when you need to create one date and work on it.

Zend\_Date is actually not allowed to use the new date object of PHP as the Zend Framework uses 5.1.4...

When the requirements are raised we are able to change this to work with the internal php functions, which will raise the speed.

Btw: Why should anyone use 365+ objects simultaneously ??? This is nonsense... even if you use 365+ objects of any other framework class (Zend\_Db for example) you will see massively speed problems.

It's always better to rely on existing objects...

And related to checking locale... there is a chapter on how to speed locale useage...

Anyway... it you have ideas of how to speed up Zend\_Date my ears are open... But without the useage of the date object which was included in 5.2 I see not very much ways to do this.
