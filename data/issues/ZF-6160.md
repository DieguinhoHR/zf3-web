Currently, it allows you to pass an array of autoloader namespaces (via the 'autoloaderNamespaces' key). If you need more customization than that, it is recommended to either pull the autoloader from Zend\_Application prior to calling bootstrap(), or to configure the autoloader prior to initializing Zend\_Application.
