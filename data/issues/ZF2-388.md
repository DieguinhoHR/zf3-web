### Description

There are a couple of situations possible with peering managers in Zend\\ServiceManager:

1. Retrieve service from manager and manager uses a peering manager
2. Set an alias and retrieve a service by the alias and the manager uses the original name

However, a cross-situation is not possible: set an alias in one manager, use a peering manager for the factory of the alias value. If I provide a view helper alias in a module configuration (the array returned from Module::getConfig()) like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'view_helpers' => array(
        'aliases' => array(
            'foo' => 'My\View\Helper\Foo',
        ),
    ),


And I set a factory in the common service manager (the array returned from Module::getServiceConfiguration()):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    use My\View\Helper as ViewHelper;
    
    return array(
        'factories' => array(
            'My\View\Helper\Foo' => function ($sm) {
                $helper = new ViewHelper\Foo;
                return $helper;
            },
        ),
    );


And in a view template I use ```` I get an error from the service manager:

bq. Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\\ServiceManager\\Exception\\ServiceNotFoundException' with message 'An alias "foo" was requested but no service could be found.'
