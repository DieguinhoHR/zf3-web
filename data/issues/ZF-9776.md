### Description

There's a small typo in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Apache404 that will prevent query string parameters (?foo=bar) from being accessible.

Seems that the two references to $\_SERVER['REDIRECT\_QUERYSTRING'] should instead be $\_SERVER['REDIRECT\_QUERY\_STRING'].

Initially I thought this may have been an Apache version specific issue, but after googling for both REDIRECT\_QUERY\_STRING and REDIRECT\_QUERYSTRING it appears that REDIRECT\_QUERYSTRING has been a typo all along.

References to the correct REDIRECT\_QUERY\_STRING are made on <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/custom-error.html>

Thanks!
