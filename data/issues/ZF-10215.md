ZF-10215: decodeGzip not decoding properly (workaround provided)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I was puzzled by why I couldn't get the body of <http://rss1.smashingmagazine.com/feed>.

Turns out decodeGzip() was ignoring some gzip material that caused gzinflate() to crash. Presumably, substr($body, 10) was passing some garbage to gzinflate().

I then learned about the gzBody() function in [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gzinflate.php#77336), which solved the problem for me.

As an incremental workaround, I have replaced the final line "return gzinflate(substr($body, 10));" with the code below.

Note that it only affects the result of decodeGzip() if gzinflate() can't inflate, so it should be compatible with older versions.

== BEGIN WORKAROUND - REPLACE RETURN LINE WITH THIS ==

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $decodedBody = gzinflate(substr($body, 10)); // Zend originally returned this (without @)
    if ($decodedBody === false) {
    
        if (substr($body,0,3) == "\x1f\x8b\x08") { 
            $i   = 10;
            $flg = ord(substr($body,3,1));
            if ($flg > 0) {
                if ($flg & 4){ 
                    list($xlen) = unpack('v', substr($body, $i, 2));
                    $i = $i + 2 + $xlen;
                }
                if ($flg&8) $i = strpos($body, "\0", $i) + 1; 
                if ($flg&16) $i = strpos($body, "\0", $i) + 1; 
                if ($flg&2) $i = $i + 2; 
            } 
            $decodedBody = gzinflate(substr($body, $i, -8)); 
        } else {
            $decodedBody = false; 
        }
    } // if !decodedBody
            
    return $decodedBody;
    


== END OF WORKAROUND ==
