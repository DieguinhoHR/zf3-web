ZF-209: Function names and use of TRUE and FALSE
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2006-07-08T12:40:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:13.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I'm slightly confused by function names given meaning numbers. It seems sometimes 'digit' is used and other times 'number'. Also they are shortened.

Functions: isDigits() isAlnum() getDigits() getAlnum() Should be isNumeric() isAlphanumeric() getNumbers() getAlphanumerics()

Also TRUE and FALSE seems to have been used routinely over true and false, personally I think the former is misleading as it implies they are constants and not language keywords. From what I can see the Zend Coding Standard doesn't specify which is acceptable.

Great, seeing as someone has been assigned to this I should probably point out some other issues:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function isBetween($value, $min, $max, $inc = true)
        {
            if ($value > $min && 
                $value < $max) {
                return true;
            }
    
            if ($value >= $min &&
                $value <= $max &&
                $inc) {
                    return true;
            }
            
            return false;
        }

                return true;
            }
    
            if ($inclusive) {
                if ($value >= $min && $value <= $max) {
                    return true;
                }
            }

    Are you planning on supporting every country? Here, I'd hope not.
    You should probably rename to IsUsaPhone() and implement select countries only, 
    i.e the ones with a phone naming system that is simple enough to get right.


That's it!

I disagree with the suggested changes to the naming convention. Digits is a very specific way to describe what's happening. The reason for Alnum is to remain consistent with the naming of the character type functions, which developers should already be familiar with.

I agree about the isName() comment. I'll remove that method, barring any objections.
