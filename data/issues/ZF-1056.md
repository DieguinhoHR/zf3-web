### Description

Feedback wanted.

Perhaps very few developers have need of this feature that provides a form of "logical" vs. "physical" session data?

{quote} -------- Original Message -------- Subject: [fw-auth] Zend\_Session\_Namespace - small patch Date: Tue, 13 Mar 2007 18:37:04 -0700 From: Gavin Vess [gavin@zend.com](mailto:gavin@zend.com) To: Zend Auth List [fw-auth@lists.zend.com](mailto:fw-auth@lists.zend.com)

We currently have _transparent_ read access to data expiring at the end of a session that works just like accessing any other key in a session namespace. However, there is no write access to this set of data.  
 Write access would support the concept of logical session data. For example, there is no method in Zend\_Session\_Namespace:

public function setTemp($name, $value)

With such a method, we can keep temporary, computed "session" data grouped together with regular persistent session data, without making the temporary data persistent. Then, we can use all the other nice features, like magic \_\_get() with the computed session data. For those with complex situations where some computed data simply can not be stored along with regular session data, this patch provides a mechanism to "splice in" and simulate persistence of "out of band" session data, _without_ breaking the session namespace concept. The rest of the application will not be burdened with unnecessary logic to determine where to find this computed session data.

It sets the variable in the \_expiredData[] section of the private static variable.

Thoughts?

Interest in this tiny feature is completely non-existent at this time.
