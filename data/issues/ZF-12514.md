### Description

Zend\_Log allows to add extra information for a message. If this parameters is a string, it joins $event with key "info".

It is then written to database by Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db. Even if there is no extra, the writer tries to access it because it's listed in $columnMap.

Failed, it generates E\_NOTICE and tries to write NULL into database. Eventually it fails with fatal error because the column does not allow NULL.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $columnMap = [
        'priority' => 'priorityName',
        'message'  => 'message',
        'info'     => 'info'
    ];

$log = new Zend\_Log(); $log->addWriter(new App\_Log\_Writer($db)); $log->info('message', 'extra'); $log->info('message');
