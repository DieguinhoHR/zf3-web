### Description

Date examples can be misleading for some users as looking at the given dates one cannot say if YYYY-MM-DD format is used or maybe YYYY-DD-MM. This is especially visible on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.constants.html) page where additional "precautions" were taken to ensure reader knows element is which (by utilising boldface, italics and brackets). I suggest to replace all date examples accross manual and instead of i.e. "2009-02-06T14:53:27+01:00" use something like "2009-02-21 T14:53:27+01:00". I believe nobody would be in need of any additional info to discover that field "21" is not a month in there
