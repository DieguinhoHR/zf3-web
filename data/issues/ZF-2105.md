This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

+1 for getStaticFilter()

In the MVC layer Matthew has used this naming for the helperBroker too HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('x')

Matthew, please decide what we should do with this. 3 possibilities that I see: close as 'will not fix', mark as 'postponed' and fix version 'next major release', or handle it now by deprecating the get() method and adding the new method. The last possibility has the advantage that users could start migrating their apps now, although we may need to firm up our deprecation policies and processes before taking such actions.

Implemented with r17073.

After discussion with the dev-team we changed the function name to Zend\_Filter::filterStatic()
