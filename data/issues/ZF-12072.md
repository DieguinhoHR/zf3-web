ZF-12072: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url doesn't encode arrays
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

$\_POST decodes correctly myvar%5B0%5D=1. This is returned from Zend\_Request::getParam correctly:

Array( 0 => 1 )

when Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url::simple($module, $controller, $action, array('myvar' => array(0 => 1))); is called it triggers an E\_WARNING because urlencode isn't able to encode arrays.

i believe this can be easily fixed using http\_build\_query in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url

It appears that you probably expected the url helper to produce the query string for your url, but this is not the intent of the component, it is only for reversing a route to produce the path section of the url. to produce your query string, please use http\_build\_query as you mentioned above.

I am closing this, as there is no support for array parameters in routes at all, so this is just not going to be possible to implement in a sane way.
