### Description

Currently there is no way to set the connection timeout for Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap::connect, used in Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap::\_\_construct. Please provide a way of configuring this. Additionally, it would be beneficial to pass the error code in the exception thrown for better logging. Here is a proposed use of fsocketopen in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap::connect:

$errno = 0; $err = ''; $this->\_socket = @fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, $timeout); if (!$this->\_socket) { throw new Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception("cannot connect to host, error $errno: $errstr"); }
