### Description

Zend\_Form ordering is not working correctly -- it's not picking up the element order when rendering.

Reproduce code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    
    $form->addElement('submit', 'submit')->submit->setLabel('Submit')->setOrder(30);
    $form->addElement('text', 'name')->name->setLabel('Name')->setOrder(10);
    $form->addElement('text', 'email')->email->setLabel('E-mail')->setOrder(20);
    $form->setView(new Zend_View());
    
    echo $form;


Expected order would be name, email, submit; actual order with 1.5.0RC1 is submit, name, email.
