### Description

Just only used :

require\_once 'Zend/Service/Twitter.php';  
 $twitter = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter('username', 'pasword');

I'm using 1.9 zend version and Zend/Validate/Hostname/Com.php exists

What could it be?

I just deleted previous versions and uploaded 1.9 version to library folder

Thanks a lot

Autoloading enabled ? Zend\_Loader ? PHP Release ?

PHP Version 5.1.6 Not using zend\_loader not using autoloading

require\_once don't load the class?

thanks

There is no "require\_once" for this file. It is included within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname by calling "include $filename". And as it's a ressource file there is no class to load.

There are several possibilities to get this error in my opinion: \* Manual loading of this ressource file \* Probably using autoloader (expectation) \* Partitial release (missing files) \* Release prior 1.8 (no com detection supported)

I meant I did "require\_once 'Zend/Service/Twitter.php'; " nothing about loading com.php,

Should i do it? If I should how can I do it? I understand that it should be including Zend\_Validate\_Hostname?

I'm not using manual loading of any other file than Zend\_Service\_Twitter Not using autoloader

thanks

I still expect that autoloader is somehow active...

Try this simple line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $content = include 'Zend/Validate/Hostname/Com.php';
    var_Dump($content);


This is the line which is run by Zend\_Validate\_Hostname to include the ressource file, and this is the line where you said that the exception is returned.

Also to mention... it would be nice to get the complete exception stack and not only the message.

I'll try what you say

the full message:

Thomas i tried your code and it let me see the dump of the file perfectly

Is it meaning I have actived autoloader?

Thanks again

I think that you are not using 1.9.2

I just checked the code line which is thrown as exception content...

Line 331 within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname as mentioned in your provided exception text:

0 /usr/share/ZendGdata/library/Zend/Validate/Hostname.php(331): Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Validate\_H...')
===============================================================================================================

its a API comment line within 1.9.2. There is no "loadClass" call at all. So my first expectation, that you are not using ZF 1.9.2, is correct.

Check your installation and update the old components and it will work.

Thanks Thomas, i was sure about using 1.9.2 but it's true that I was mixing components maybe an error uploading all the new version

Thanks again, and sorry about my error
