### Description

For tables that have no primary keys (don't blame me, I didn't write the horrifying SQL schema ;)), warnings will be thrown because array\_key\_exists is invoked against an undefined variable.

At/around line 225 in Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mssql.php is the offending bit of code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $isPrimary = array_key_exists($row[$column_name], $primaryKeyColumn);


$primaryKeyColumn is never initialised, so somewhere around line 209 this change should be made:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $primaryKeysResult = $stmt->fetchAll(Zend_Db::FETCH_NUM);
            $pkey_column_name = 3;
            $pkey_key_seq = 4;
    +        
    +        $primaryKeyColumn = array();
            foreach ($primaryKeysResult as $pkeysRow) {
                $primaryKeyColumn[$pkeysRow[$pkey_column_name]] = $pkeysRow[$pkey_key_seq];
            }


Initially I thought it should be enough to just cast to an array, but that still threw a Notice. This actually addresses the issue.

Cheers,

Initially I thought that it should be enough just to cast to an array, but PHP still threw a Notice about the variable being undefined. So, let's actually define the variable. :)
