### Description

Nice Feature, but according to RFC 2821 Chapter 5, a mailserver which is correctly configured must not have a MX-RR. Checking such a Server with Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress::setValidateMx() may result in a negativ Result, but the Server may receive e-mails. Due too this reason the MX-Check does not really make sence.

"If no MX records are found, but an A RR is found, the A RR is treated as if it was associated with an implicit MX RR, with a preference of 0, pointing to that host." (see <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt>)

I think this is actually an improvement to the code, not the docs.

I just added a complete rework of Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress... this feature has also been added to incubator for tests.See SVN r17945 for details.

This issue is not resolved in 1.10 or trunk, a domain with a RR record and not an MX record will still fail. It looks as though it was not implemented.
