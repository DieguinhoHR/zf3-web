### Description

The new release seems to have broken the 0.1.5 behaviour, and the documentation does not appear to have been updated (by all means, correct me if I'm wrong).

The default routes no longer work, and addRoute method no longer functions as documented.

For instance

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute('user', 'user/:username', array('controller' => 'user', 'action' => 'info'));


now gives the following error:

Fatal error: Argument 2 passed to Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter::addRoute() must be an object of class Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface, called in /foo/bar/index.php on line 51 and defined in /foo/library/Zend/Controller/RewriteRouter.php on line 64

Assigning to Matthew, change component to Zend\_Controller.

Assigning to Martel, lead on RewriteRouter component.
