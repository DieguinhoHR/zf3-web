### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial allows an $\_objectKey to be set; this is helpful since it allows you to call functions on the object in the partialLoop

The below example worked in 1.5.1 but now fails in 1.5.2 since $this->model is turned into an array.

myview.phtml <?php $partial = $this->partialLoop(); $partial->setObjectKey('model'); print $partial->partialLoop('mypartial.phtml', $this->dbRowset); ?>

mypartial.phtml <?php $this->model->function(); ?>

I propose editing L:70 of Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartialLoop

From:

if (is\_object($model) && method\_exists($model, 'toArray')) {

To:

if (is\_object($model) && method\_exists($model, 'toArray') && $this->\_objectKey === null) {

this was fixed [[http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Standard_Library?cs=10278)] and is a dupe of ZF-4141
