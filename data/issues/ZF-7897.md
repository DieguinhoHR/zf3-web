### Description

Line indentation is currently done "by hand" for example in the console help system.

This could more easily be done with a ResponseDecorator that allows to specify the content option:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $response->appendContent("foo", array("indentation" => 8));


A patch for this decorator is appended.
