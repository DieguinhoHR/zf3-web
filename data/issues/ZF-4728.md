### Description

I have to say, that i dont know, if this behaviour is mentioned as issue before. ;)

I thought, that the method _setReadOnly()_ acts like the constructor-parameter _allowModifications_, so Im able to build up a configuration from different sources and merge it into one, but the method only locks the object itself, not the containing objects, as it will be done when setting the constructor-parameter to _false_.

 
    <pre class="highlight">$array = array ('key1'=>1,'key2'=>array('a'=>1,'b'=>2));
    $c = new Zend_Config($array,false);
    $c->key2->a = 3;

Will throw an Exception as expected.

 
    <pre class="highlight">$array = array ('key1'=>1,'key2'=>array('a'=>1,'b'=>2));
    $c = new Zend_Config($array,true);
    $c->setReadOnly();
    $c->key2->a = 3;

Will not throw an Exception (as not expected).

Changing _setReadOnly()_

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function setReadOnly()
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
        }

to

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function setReadOnly()
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
            foreach (this->_data as $value) {
              if ($value instanceof Zend_Config) {
                $value->setReadOnly();
              }
            }
        }

will also lock nested objects and will make the behaviour equal to that of the constructor-parameter. And makes the method more useful ;) I dont see, why i should be able to lock a config, but are able to change deeper config settings.

I usually use this method to apply readOnly to the current iteration's elements.Because i separate readonly segment and allowModificatable segment . I prefer to add a method setReadOnlyRecursively() as follows for more flexibilty and backward compatibility.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setReadOnlyRecursively()
        {
            $this->setReadOnly();
            foreach ($this as $value) {
                if ($value instanceof Zend_Config) {
                    $value->setReadOnlyRecursively();
                }
            }
        }

BC is an argument, i see. But as segment i understand that as the current element including its childs. In my eyes its seems confusing, that I can set an element as read only, but its childs are not. I dont mind to use another method instead, but it should be possible to do so. An optional parameter will also not break BC.

 
    <pre class="highlight">public function setReadOnly($recursive = false)
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
            if ($recursive) {
              foreach (this->_data as $value) {
                if ($value instanceof Zend_Config) {
                  $value->setReadOnly();
                }
              }
            }
        }

But keep the BC will not solve the different behaviours beetween constructor-parameter and method.

Yes , I think that it would be advisable to accord the natual code priority over BC.So, I'm fine with that an optional parameter set to true. So,like this. I corrected some point.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setReadOnly($recursive = true)
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
            if ($recursive) {
              foreach ($this->_data as $value) {
                if ($value instanceof Zend_Config) {
                  $value->setReadOnly($recursive);
                }
              }
            }
        }


By the way ,actually setting readonly partially seems confusing .By ordinary a segment is mentioned as the element including its children.

But we don't have any options to separately set readonly to the value element in the config.Therefore, in this case, this->setReadOnly's targets are that this->\_data excluding objects instanceof Zend\_Config. There is a difference between iterator and recursive iterator.

For instance;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    admin = foo
    controllers.front = index
    controllers.some = bar


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    controllers.some = special


In this case,"$config->setReadOnly(false);" allows me to set readOnly to admin, and allowModification to controllers.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = Zend_Config_Ini("base.ini", null, true);
    $extraConf = Zend_Config_Ini("extra.ini", null, false);
    $config->setReadOnly(false);
    $config->controllers->merge($extraConf->controllers);

I see this as a bug that should be fixed rather than B/C behaviour that should be maintained. Clearly if you call setReadOnly() you expect that the entire config object is now read only and cannot be modified.

Fair enough. I'll leave it up to you. Thanks
