### Description

i try this in Eclipse(3.3) PDT , but i think that this is in Zend Studio too

// getting a Zend\_Cache\_Core object $cache = Zend\_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);

but now i cant get no intelligence for $cache, due Zend\_Cache::factory says in comments \* @return Zend\_Cache\_Frontend

but class named Zend\_Cache\_Frontend hasn't exist so IDE don't know that too.

maybe is better to use something like this, due all frontend, backend classes extends or interface those:

- @return Zend\_Cache\_Core|Zend\_Cache\_Backend|Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface

and then IDE gives you all those classes methods with comments where they belong - this is better than nothing

fixed in SVN trunk (I used "@return Zend\_Cache\_Core|Zend\_Cache\_Frontend" only because the factory method doesn't return any backends, only frontends)

thanks
