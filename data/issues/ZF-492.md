### Description

After using $view->setScriptPath('a\_path'); the path is not only a\_path but both a\_path and the current (bootstrap) directory. (The manual says in chapter 17.2.3 controllers directory, but that's not true.)

If I have a view script called index.php that resides in a\_path everything works fine. But if the a\_path/index.php isn't available the file is searched in the current directory instead. In case of the index.php this is the bootstrap file.

Currently the setScriptPath method's code is this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setScriptPath($path)
    {
        $this->_path['script'] = array('');
        $this->_addPath('script', $path);
    }


As you see, there is set always an empty string entry in the path representing the current directory. In my opinion this should only set if $path is null.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setScriptPath($path)
    {
        $this->_path['script'] = (null === $path) ? array('') : array();
        $this->_addPath('script', $path);
    }

Issue resolved in revision 1483 of subversion. Added accessors for getScriptPaths(), getHelperPaths(), and getFilterPaths() to aid in testing. Zend\_View now explicitly requires setting a view script path in order to operate.
