Hi Wil,

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Assigning to Aldemar as he currently has a component that will fix this issue in the laboratory. Aldemar, please let us know when your component is ready for recommendation again.

While this is a worthwhile feature, the ZF team will not develop this feature, but if a community member would like to pick up and develop it, they may make an assignment of it.

This is not trivial to fix, and seems more like userland code. I'd mark this issue as "won't fix"

I don't imagine that at this late stage of ZFv1's lifecycle that this will be added. If anyone would like to propose it for ZFv2, feel free to draft up an RFC on the ZF2 wiki ;)
