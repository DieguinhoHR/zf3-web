ZF-4081: Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitContainer producing invalid XHTML
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitContainer is pulling all the atributes from the form element when it is used to decorate it. As a result we get div with method, action, name etc attributes. A solution should be implicitly or explicitly tell the decorator, which attributes to pull, in dependance of element/decorator type.
