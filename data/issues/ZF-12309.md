ZF-12309: Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Files prepends '/' to filename
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When creating and downloading files the leading '/' is not stripped from the path. This means that you cannot download files that have been uploaded to the root of the container via the control panel (they have no leading '/').

I've got a patch for this. Just waiting for CLA to get approved.

Actually this isn't exactly a bug. I'm working on a stream wrapper for cloudfiles, and that was sending the path with a forward slash prepended.

However the attached stops stupids like me breaking things and the code a little tidier (imho ;)

ZF-12327 has a more complete patch that includes validation of the container and object names.
