### Description

Citing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point\_(typography)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)):

{quote} the desktop publishing point (also called the PostScript point), which has been rounded to an even 72 points to the inch (1 point = 127⁄360 mm = 352.7 µm). {quote}

However, point is declared as '0.00035' in Zend\_Measure\_Length. According to the definition it should be 0.000352777778 meter.

Point is defined as 1 to 0.00035. Point\_Adobe is defined as 1 to 0.000 352 777 777 78.

So when you want to calculate postscript (which uses the measurement from adobe) then you must also use POINT\_ADOBE and not POINT (which declares the brittain point unit for length and not the computional length)

Thanks for pointing this out, I am sorry to raise a non-issue. Maybe we should add the comment that POINT\_ADOBE stands for the "Postscript point" or "desktop publishing point".
