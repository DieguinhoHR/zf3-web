ZF-3120: Zend\_Form::\_sort() can't sort when ordered and unordered elements are set (with solution)

### Description

Get following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('a',array('label'=>'a')));
    $form->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('b',array('label'=>'b', 'order'=>0)));
    $form->addElement(new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('c',array('label'=>'c', 'order'=>1)));
    echo $form;


Only submits _'b'_ and _'c'_ are displayed.

Reason: In Zend/Form.php (@version $Id: Form.php 8996 2008-03-22 16:59:06Z matthew $) there is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2507:  if (array_search($index, $this->_order, true)) {
    2508:      ++$index;
    2509:  }
    2510:  $items[$index] = $key;


In example above, this condition is true for index equal to _0_ AND _1_, but because there is just _if_, it is executed only once, so index is set to _1_. To _$items[1]_ is set submit _'a'_. But it is overwritten by submit _'c'_, because submit _'c'_ has order set explicitly so no check is performed.

Solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2507:  while (array_search($index, $this->_order, true)) {
