### Description

Now that this component is here, the method getBrowser() from Zend\_Locale should move to Zend\_Http\_UserAgent.

Because the language is also from the UserAgent. Further Zend\_Locale can use that feature from Zend\_Http\_UserAgent.

This bringt more consistence. I searched a while in the UserAgent component for exact that feature.

Closing as won't fix

Core components like the localization part of ZF should be single contained. Moving such methods to other components leads to a time consuming behaviour... this would mean that Zend\_Http is ALWAYS needed and loaded before any other component only because the HTTP accept header is searched for the best matching locale.
