### Description

The function Zend\_OpenId::normalize() removes URL Fragments. OpenID 2.0 uses them as Part of the OpenID to enable the "recycling" of OpenID URLs. This is an issue with Yahoo: <http://developer.yahoo.com/openid/faq.html> (read "Identifier Recycling" on this page). I think normalize() should just keep the fragment.
