ZF-9093: Zend\_Date setMilliseconds/addMilliseconds
---------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Date will never return the milliseconds if you run setMiliscond(Null);

If you take the intval of the microseconds frim microtime() you will always get 0 as it is a decimal number.

list($milli, $time) = explode(" ", microtime()); $milli = intval($milli);

I have tried to run the following to get a timestamp in DB2 format but it still is not correct.

list( $decimalMilliseconds, $uts ) = split( ' ', microtime()); $Date = new Zend\_Date(); $Date->setFractionalPrecision(6); $milli = intval($decimalMilliseconds \* 1000000); $Date->setMilliSecond($milli, 6); echo("Current: " . str\_pad($Date->get('yyyy-MM-dd-H.mm.ss.S'), 25, "0") . "  
");

Yet this still does not work as it drops the leading zero from the milliseconds. For example I should get this: 2010-02-05-08.41.14.032065 but I end up and get 2010-02-05-8.41.14.320650

This makes if very hard to use Zend\_Date to get a DB2 Timestamp basically worthless.

Running your test-code on ZF 1.10 I get

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Current: 2010-02-05-21.52.03.093342


which is correct as you defined a precision of 6. Therefor closing as not reproducable.

Note that when you give NULL as milliseconds, you will only then get correct milliseconds in return when your OS supports this.

Note from PHP's manual: {quote} microtime() returns the current Unix timestamp with microseconds. This function is only available on operating systems that support the gettimeofday() system call. {quote}

I tested this with Windows and Linux with equal results.

My OS does support gettimeofday(): [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/â€¦](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v6r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/apis/gettod.htm)

Yes my test code does return the microseconds, but it does so impropperly by dropping the leading zero, and yet again I should not have to write 6 lines of code to get what should be returned by just calling setMilliSecond with null.
