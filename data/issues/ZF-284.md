### Description

This enhancement outlines functionality for adding routes to Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter directly from a Zend\_Config file. This was requested from the ZF-General list as a desirable, so as to assist developers during development and to remove configuration from the bootstrap and into a more uniform container.

Developers would nominate a 'section' within their Zend\_Config file (be it XML, .ini or array), then populate a number of named routes, each with their own route, default value(s) and requirements. These key=>values map directly to those required by the Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter when adding routes, so there is little or no overhead converting the config file to individual routes.

Example:-

====================================

Config file (as .ini)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    route.archive.route = news/:year/:month
    route.archive.defaults.year = 2006
    route.archive.defaults.month = 1
    route.archive.reqs.year = \d+
    route.archive.reqs.month = \d+


or as .xml

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    news/:year20061\d+\d+

====================================

A new method for Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function addConfig(Zend_Config $config, $section) {
        if (is_null($config->{$section})) {
            throw new exception("no router configuration in section '{$section}'");
        }
        foreach ($config->{$section} as $name => $info) {
            $this->addRoute($name, new Zend_Controller_Router_Route($info->route,
                                                                        $info->defaults->asArray(),
                                                                        $info->reqs->asArray()));
        }
    }


====================================

And then your bootstrap file would simply contain:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config(new Zend_Config_Ini('/my/path/config.ini', 'development'));
    $router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();
    $router->addConfig($config, 'route'); // tells the router to look for section 'route' within the Zend_Config object


====================================

Added ``` tags to your issue text. Makes it a bit more readable.
