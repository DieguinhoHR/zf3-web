### Description

I have an index with a Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_Utf8Num\_CaseInsensitive analyzer.

When I query the index with the query "foo\_bar\*" (without quotes) I get the following exception: Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParserException' with message 'Wildcard search is supported only for non-multiple word terms' in Zend/Search/Lucene/Search/Query/Preprocessing/Term.php:182

I get no exception when I query with the query "foo bar\*".

I've looked within Term.php and in the first example with "foo\_bar\*" as query, the analyzer tokenizes the query index into 'foo' and 'bar' but in the second example to only 'bar'. The first example given me therefor an exception because on line 180: if (count($tokens) > 1) { throw exception; }

I'm a bit confused on how the analyzer works because if the analyzer tokenizes words in cases of characters like an underscore or an '@'-sign _and_ with plain spaces I would expect to get an exception in both cases. For some reason, it doesn't seem to tokenize the query "foo bar\*" into 2 tokens where I would've expected it.

Now, to work around this I could rerun the analyzer to check if the query got tokenized into multiple tokens. If the only 1 token is found i could append a wildcard (because my app requires it that way) and otherwise I should not append it.

Is this just a limitation of the module or doesn't the analyzer work properly? Please shine some light into this one :) Thanks!
