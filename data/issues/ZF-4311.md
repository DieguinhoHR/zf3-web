### Description

The new validator, 'Identical', is not in the documentation. I think this is a pretty important validator, I just can't get it to work properly and can't find any info on it outside of the comments in the Identical.php file. I really want to set it up in a form using a Zend\_Config\_Xml object, but can't figure out how to reference the form element to compare against inside of the config file.

For now you can use the documentation on Zym\_Confirm: [http://zym-project.com/docs/reference/â€¦](http://www.zym-project.com/docs/reference/zym.validate.set.html#zym.validate.set.confirm)
