### Description

Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp\_TableMessage class has no set/get methods for it's property "rows"

It would be cool to have these methods as we may want to alter the rows previously entered.

This was an issue I had encountered while working on the Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug. I wanted to alter the table it shows (wanted to add a results column to show the results returning from sql queries), so I extended the Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug. I did not changed any of the working part (did not alter the queryEnd() part). Once I have fetched my results to an array (as I have called the queryEnd() previously this fetchings does not affect the execution time of the query), I wanted to add these results to the table created by the firebug profiler. But as "\_rows" was protected I was unable to get and alter it's data.

Here is a patch I have written for the current issue. I don't know if that helps or not.

Thanks for the patch. I'll apply it ASAP.

Would you be open to sharing your extended Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug class? I may be able to incorporate it into a new component I am working on for ZF.

Applied patch with some modifications and added unit test.

Of course. Here is the class I extended. It's not much as I did not need a lot of things. Just edited the current row and added a new column to the table.
