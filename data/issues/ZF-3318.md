### Description

I receive this emails send via a newsletter-broker by a large german internet-provider-company frequently. One of their parts has the following signature:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ------=_Part_1211565553483705f1279d64.44505779
    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary= "----=_Alternative_1211565553483705f1280701.15526894"


(Note the whitespace between "boundary=" and its value "----=\_Alternative\_1211565553483705f1280701.15526894")

When trying to parse for the message parts, the value of the boundary-property gets translated to (see Zend/Mime/Decode.php line 219)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "[whitespace]----=_Alternative_1211565553483705f1280701.15526894"


which causes the Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitMime() to substitute this value to (see Zend/Mime/Decode.php line 54)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "--"[whitespace]----=_Alternative_1211565553483705f1280701.15526894""


resulting in not finding the related part for this boundary.

Suggested fix: use trim() before looking up quotes in header-values.
