ZF-7424: Adapter helper functions into Zend\_Db\_Table
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Could helper functions for ease of use of Zend\_Db\_Table be added?

functions such as:

getTable($name) - includes, instanciates and returns a table object based on the name select(.+)() - creates a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select from the name trailing the select, e.g. $adapter->selectProjects() find(.+)($arg1, $arg2 ...) - does a find on the table specified from the name trailing the find, e.g. $adapter->findProjects(1) fetchNew(.+)() - runs the fetchNew function on the table specified from the name trailing the fetchNew

I've implemented the functions myself already:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        public function getTable($table) {
            $table = ucfirst($table);
            Zend_Loader::loadClass($table);
            $table = new $table(array('db' => $this));
            return $table;
        }
        
        public function __call($name, $args) {
            if (preg_match('/^select(.+)/i', $name, $match)) {
                $table = $this->getTable($match[1]);
                return $table->select();
            } else if (preg_match('/^find(.+)/i', $name, $match)) {
                $table = $this->getTable($match[1]);
                return call_user_func_array(array($table, 'find'), $args);
            } else if (preg_match('/^fetchNew(.+)/i', $name, $match)) {
                $table = $this->getTable($match[1]);
                return $table->fetchNew();
            }
        }

I don't we think we should. I think you should just extend Zend\_Db\_Table to make it suite your needs (as does the rest of the world).

Proposing to close as wont-fix or not an issue

extending Zend\_Db\_Table doesn't make it any easier to instanciate. You still have to do new TableName(array('db' => $adapter)), somewhat cumbersome for what could be an effective ORM

Zend\_Db is not an ORM. And jfyi; before 1.9 Zend\_Date was abstract, and /had to/ be extended on a per-table basis. This is not bad practice whatsoever.

And by that argument, we should be doing $select = new Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select($table) rather than $table->select() ?

I wasn't disputing the practice of instanciating classes, I was just suggesting useful magic helpers which help speed up frequently created table functions.

Ok, I accept there are some limitations to this idea, as this needs $table to be the exact class name, but the way the Table's referenceMap instanciates the dependent tables is exactly the same. I was just hoping for constructive criticism.

Zend\_Db\_Adapter should not be aware of Zend\_Db\_Table. The only coupling designed in is that Zend\_Db\_Table is coupled with Zend\_Db\_Adatper, so just a one way requirement.

As for your features: you should have a look at the new instantiation feature of Zend\_Db\_Table. There is a note at the top of the manual:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html)

and here:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.definition.html)

This allows for easy instantiation based off a definition file (if you need to maintain relationships), outside of that, you can simply create a table object that will utilize a table name provided in the constructor.

Ok, thanks, not exactly what I was looking for though, I do understand you not wanting to add a cyclic dependency.

I am writing a framework which sits on top of ZF mvc, which makes it easy to get going, e.g. in a controller being able to do $this->getDb('connectionName')->selectTableName() and I thought it would be best to integrate the table/row ability into the adapter.

I'll instead create a loosly coupled class around the top that gives the same functions but with my own additions.

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-07-31T13:54:21.000+0000

Yeah, I think it would be more appropriate to add a service layer (concrete or abstract) that would proxy to the adapter and the tables. This way you've created a composite api for the functionality you want without compromising the level of coupling that would/might cause confusion.

For example, $this->getDataModel('connectionName')->... , where a DataModel (via a controller action helper) would combine the Adapter and Table/Row apis to do what you want to do.
