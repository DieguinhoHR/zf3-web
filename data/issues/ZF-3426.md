### Description

Assuming I have a project with several different sub-domains for different sections of the site, e.g. <www.example.com> and admin.example.com

Each of these sections has a different set of controller modules inside its own main folder, and has its own bootstrap file.

To avoid naming conflicts inside the project, I would like to have the ability to prefix each class with the section name, e.g.: <http://www.example.com/catalog/product> -> Www\_Catalog\_ProductController <http://admin.example.com/catalog/product> -> Admin\_Catalog\_ProductController

I solved this in my project by extending the dispatcher and overriding formatClassName(), but it would be nice to have such ability in the standard dispatcher.

This should be possible with the new hostname route shipped as of 1.6.0.
