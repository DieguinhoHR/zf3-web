### Description

i think Zend\_Tool can be improved in the following ways

1. upon module generation i think

resources.frontController.moduleDirectory = APPLICATION\_PATH "/modules"

should be added to application.ini

1. Class names should be named with the Module prefix

eg. Admin\_IndexController

currently when i generate a controller inside a module, the class name does not have the module name prefixed to it.
