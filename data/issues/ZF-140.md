ZF-140: Zend\_DB PDO insert
---------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-23T08:10:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:29.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.4 (29/Jun/06)

### Description

When using the PDO to perform an insert and the column name contains an underscore it can't find the binded paramater.

$db = Zend\_Db::factory('pdoMssql', array(CONNECTION STUFF)); $db->insert('TABLENAME', array('column\_name' => 1234));

Fails: SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: parameter was not defined

In the Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php insert method the binded value replaces \_ to nothing but the binded keys are not also replaced so PDO can't find the match.

Using the above as an example the SQL looks like: INSERT INTO TABLENAME(column\_name) VALUES(:columnname) but the $bind array still looks like ('column\_name' => 1234).

I'm pretty sure this is a dup and has been fixed.

Yes, this should be fixed in the "developer" version.
