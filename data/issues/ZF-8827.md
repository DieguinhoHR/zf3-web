ZF-8827: Zend\_Feed outputs "published" tag for main Atom feed

### Description

I am using setPublishedDate on the \_header of a Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Interface object. It should have no effect on the Atom feed, as the published element is only valid for an individual entry, not for the whole feed (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.9>) However, the tag is written for the feed, causing validation to fail.

I would recommend trying Zend\_Feed\_Writer, currently available from trunk, and releasing with 1.10.0 later this month (a beta will release today). Its support for Atom is comprehensive and follows the specification.

Good to know, thanks.

I can't try the new version, but if it's following the spec, then I'm happy.

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
