### Description

Fetching tracklist from Amazon search is not working properly when product (album) has more than 1 disc.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Service/Amazon/Query.php';
    $query = new Zend_Service_Amazon_Query('XXXXXXXXXXXX','UK');
    $query->Category('Blended')->Keywords("5036742001123")->ResponseGroup('Tracks,Small,Medium,ItemAttributes');
    $results = $query->search();
    Zend_Debug::dump($results->current()->Tracks);


outputs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(1) {
      [""] => string(14) "Rock Tha House"
    }


output should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(2) {
      [1] => array(11) {
        [0] => string(12) "Ressurection"
        [1] => string(6) "Creeps"
        [2] => string(15) "White lightning"
        [3] => string(14) "Check-out Time"
        [4] => string(6) "Pacman"
        [5] => string(9) "Reach out"
        [6] => string(7) "Syringe"
        [7] => string(14) "Rock Tha House"
        [8] => string(5) "Greed"
        [9] => string(10) "Flightpath"
        [10] => string(8) "Fastlane"
      }
      [2] => array(13) {
        [0] => string(6) "Creeps"
        [1] => string(10) "Flightpath"
        [2] => string(12) "Ressurection"
        [3] => string(9) "Reach out"
        [4] => string(7) "Syringe"
        [5] => string(14) "Check out time"
        [6] => string(15) "White lightning"
        [7] => string(6) "Pacman"
        [8] => string(5) "Greed"
        [9] => string(11) "Bleep bleep"
        [10] => string(12) "Kerb crawler"
        [11] => string(8) "Fastlane"
        [12] => string(14) "Rock Tha House"
      }
    }


To resolve this problem: Line 156 in file Zend/Service/Amazon/Item.php is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    But it should be

I am not seeing that code in the Zend/Service/Amazon/Item.php file. Can you tell me what version of ZF you are using? You can check in the Zend/Version.php file.

The latest trunk file has this on like 156

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Service/Amazon/Image.php';

Version 1.7.5 ... downloaded few days ago.

And line 156 in Zend/Service/Amazon/Item.php _IS_ ```

I can't look what's in trunk ... Code Browser is down at the moment :(

Trunk has a lot of other fixes in it that was the release branch has. I'm looking into why the trunk never got synced to the release branch on these fixes.

These have been merged into the release branch (r14126) and will come out with the next release.
