### Description

The Reference Guide mentions class constants Zend\_Http\_Request::GET and others in section 23.1.3:

The request() method takes one optional parameter - the request method. This can be either GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS or CONNECT as defined by the HTTP protocol [1]. For convenience, these are all defined as class constants: Zend\_Http\_Request::GET, Zend\_Http\_Request::POST and so on.

Zend\_Http\_Request class seems not to exist, though. It should be fixed to Zend\_Http\_Client, as it is the right class containing the constants.
