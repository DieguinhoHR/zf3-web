-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If $\_uri set to null, Zend\_Navigation\_Page cannot instantitate by factory, does not recognizes uri. It's because of line 211: $hasUri = isset($options['uri']); isset returns false if value is null This should be corrected to $hasUri = array\_key\_exists('uri', $options);

It just does not make sense that you should be able to create a uri page, with no uri.

Also (still) affects version 1.12.1.

There is one clear use for this (or I'm missing the other way to achieve that);

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu::htmlify() specifies: "Returns an HTML string containing an 'a' element for the given page if the page's href is not empty, and a 'span' element if it is empty". By setting the uri to null, this would create a span element.

I thought I needed this specific case. But I think it's better I just render the menu myself.

Though I don't see how I would do something similar with Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc. The way to get to an empty href with that class (for in the menu) seems either complex or impossible.

So it's perhaps weird that this is even in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu::htmlify().

@Alex Use an empty string for the URI property.
