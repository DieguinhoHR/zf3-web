### Description

If data are not cached, Zend\_Translate\_Adapter calls abstract method \_loadTranslationData which usually support $options['clear'] option, but if data are cached Zend\_Translate\_Adapter only does this: $this->\_translate = unserialize($result), even when $options['clear'] is true of false. And also when the cache is saved, whole \_translate data are saved, not only those which have been added in this one call of addTranslation.

Edit: I would expect that if I call method addTranslation it would do the same with caching and without caching, but it doesn't. For example this code:

Zend\_Translate::setCache($someCache); $translate = new Zend\_Translate('tmx','some/file.tmx','en'); $translate->addTranslation('some/file2.tmx','en');

I would expect that call of addTranslation would create cache with 'en' data of file 'some/file2.tmx', but it does cache with data of both files. If you run first example code and then this code:

Zend\_Translate::setCache($someCache); $translate = new Zend\_Translate('tmx','some/file2.tmx','en');

then in $translate will be loaded also data of 'some/file.tmx' what is, in my opinion, wrong.

Edit2: I am using revision 11536, url: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/), and the problem that I described above happens in this revision. Isn't it the latest version? Only try the example, I think that what it does is not expected behaviour.

Reading your description I expect that you are referring to an outdated version and not to trunk.

Data is saved in file basis and not the complete data in one cache. The clear option is only used for reading new files. When you use cache for already read files it would be nonsense to empty the complete cache.

Problem description does not fit to actual implementation.

I can only reply what I already said.

What you describe is not true for trunk. The new implementation works completly different.

But when you want to prevent the loading of data which is in the cache you have to empty the cache. The 'clear' option has nothing to do with the cache itself.
