ZF-1933: SMTP transport adds extra EOL characters for many MTAs

### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp uses the EOL character "\\r\\n". Unfortunately, with some servers such as Exchange, this causes the headers to have extraneous EOL characters, effectively mangling them. Solution is to set Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp::EOL to simply "\\n"
