ZF-1876: Zend\_Controller\_Action::run() (as Page Controller) does not transform action request to dispatchable name

### Description

Assuming:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        Zend_Loader::loadClass('ErrorController', APPLICATION_PATH . 'user/modules/default/controllers/');
        $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
        $request->setActionName('setup-error')
                ->setParam('exception', $exception);
        $ec = new ErrorController($request, new Zend_Controller_Response_Http());
        echo $ec->run();


ErrorController::run() will attempt to dispatch setup-errorController, not SetupErrorController.

PageControllers can be done with ZF, but it's not the primary purpose for Zend\_Controller\_Action, so I'm only scheduling it tentaively for 1.1.0. This can likely be achieved by adding inflection support to run() (and using the same inflection support in the dispatcher).

I propose we actually now create a Zend\_Controller\_Page for dispatching page controller dispatched action controllers (Say that 10x fast)

This is the current way of dipatching a "Page Controlled Action"

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        // An exception has occured during setup, dispatch the SetupError Action of the Error Handling Controller.
        Zend_Loader::loadClass('ErrorController', APPLICATION_PATH . 'user/modules/default/controllers/');
        $ec = new ErrorController(
            new Zend_Controller_Request_Simple('SetupError', null, null, array('exception' => $exception)), 
            new Zend_Controller_Response_Http()
            );
        echo $ec->run();
        exit();

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
