ZF-3184: Allow to force an application wide Locale
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-04-27T10:26:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-04-27T10:33:53.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently there is no way, to specify a default locale, which is always used. If you want to format all your dates on a site in en\_EN for example, you have to tell it Zend\_Date always. If you don't specify it, Zend\_Locale tries to autodetect it. The Zend\_Locale::setDefault() method doesn't behave like expected, but only works when all autodetects failed.

To solve this issue, I create a patch, which allows to call Zend\_Locale::setForcedDefault(). If Zend\_Locale is instancied with no arguments (or $locale === null), and a forced Default is specified, this is used instead of auto detection.

This is a duplicate of ZF-2876. The patch is not problem-free.
