### Description

As noted on fw-mvc, the logic of Zend\_Controller\_Front::throwExceptions() is faulty, and should be rewritten to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function throwExceptions($flag = null)
    {
        if ($flag !== null) {
            $this->_throwExceptions = (boolean) $flag;
            return $this;
        }
        return $this->_throwExceptions;
    }
