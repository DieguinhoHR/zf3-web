### Description

I am trying to use Zend\_Gdata as per Google instructions. My whole file looks like: <?php require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; // the Zend dir must be in your include\_path Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube'); Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin');

When executing, I get: PHP Warning: require\_once(Zend/Http/Response/Stream.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/lib/gdata/library/Zend/Http/Client.php on line 50 PHP Fatal error: require\_once(): Failed opening required 'Zend/Http/Response/Stream.php' (include\_path='.:/var/lib/gdata/library') in /var/lib/gdata/library/Zend/Http/Client.php on line 50

There aren't directory Called "Response" in "Http" folder.

Work arround: Comment line 50 in Client.php

I downloaded ver 1.9.7-minimal and check the Zend\_Http directory. It seems to be correct for me.

Apparently this was an mistake on my side. I downloaded: ZendGdata-1.9.7.tar instead of: ZendFramework-1.9.7-minimal.tar.

It indeed work OK with -minimal version. Although, it would be nice to have Responses in ZendGdata archive.

It looks like the library/Zend/Http/Response directory is indeed missing from the GData-specific downloads (but not others).

Assigning to Matthew to fix the build script.
