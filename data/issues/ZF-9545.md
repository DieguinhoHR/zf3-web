ZF-9545: Zend\_Validate\_Abstract \_createMessage() bug
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-26T04:54:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-26T09:03:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)

### Description

There is a code for injecting user variables into message:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($this->_messageVariables as $ident => $property) {
        $message = str_replace("%$ident%", (string) $this->$property, $message);
    }


And it doesn't work because of _$this->$property_. There should be just _$property_

Code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isValid($value, $context = null)
        {
            $this->_messageVariables = array('value1' => 'foo');
            $this->_error(self::MESSAGE_WHICH_USES_VALUE1);
        }

Your change breaks the component.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected $_messageTemplates = array(
            self::NOT_BETWEEN        => "'%value%' is not between '%min%' and '%max%', inclusively",
        );
    
        protected $_messageVariables = array(
            'min' => '_min',
            'max' => '_max'
        );


In the foreach clause it does:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            foreach ($this->_messageVariables as $ident => $property) {
                $message = str_replace("%$ident%", (string) $this->$property, $message);
            }


Using 'min' => '\_min' is searches for %$ident% which means that is searches for '%min%'. Then it is replaced by $this->$property which means that it is replaced by $this->\_min as $property == '\_min'.

And $this->\_min IS the variable which has to be replaced.

Your change would lead to the problem that %min% is replaced with $\_min.

But $\_min is a variable which must not exist... it could but there is no definition that it must exist.

By using this way it is possible to change the variables to 'min' => '\_mymin' which means that you are able to change the variable which is integrated. Your change means that you must change the message which does also mean that you MUST change all translations when you want to extend a validator.

Therefor closing as non issue
