### Description

Hi,

I had difficulties to understand the startImage function. For mean the goal is to use the background of the placed picture however the picture background will be ever set on white value.

(Ligne 505 $bg\_color = imagecolorallocate($img2, 255, 255, 255); de Zend\\Captcha\\Image.php)

It's not possible to add transparency without use the function imagecolorallocatealpha() or fix this ?

Another problem, the render is set with width and height size (getWidth() et getHeight()). As attributes of classe have default value, if I pass the image the image will be displayed considering the \_width and \_height values.

It's does make sense to let the width and height dimension to original picture or it could be more efficient to let only by default the SRC picture url instead of use HTML code. Zend can be use like compounment separe display render (html code in a classe..) and the code. (MVC)

A last question, it's not possible to use Zend\_Captcha\_Word with only digits number or regular expression (using $-^ .. symbols).

Currently it's just possible to chose letters only or mixed charsets (numbers and letters). Can you increase the possibility of Captcha\_Word component to let user use default pattern or regular expression? (Like only string, numbers, etc.)

Thanks a lot

I think your odds of a developer taking care of things would increase if you posted one issue per item - so that they can be handled individually. Also, questions should better go to the forums. Issues, accompanied by repro code, should be taken care of quick promptly.
