ZF-11542: major incompatibility introduced in commit #21893

### Description

At this time the ID creation for HTML tag was changed which has major impact on existing CSS and JavaScript.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $getId = create_function('$decorator',
                             'return $decorator->getElement()->getId()
                                     . "-element";');


To keep the compatibility this could would need to be used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $getId = create_function('$decorator',
                             'return $decorator->getElement()->getName()
                                     . "-element";');


What ever was the reason to change the way the ID is now build it would be great to make it at least possible to keep compatibility for existing projects. My proposal for such way is to add static member variable:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Form_Element implements Zend_Validate_Interface
    {
        public static $decoratorIdFunc = 'return $decorator->getElement()->getId(). "-element";';
    ...
            $getId = create_function('$decorator', self::$decoratorIdFunc);
    }
    
    // somewhere in Bootstrap for projects depending on old IDs
    Zend_Form_Element::$decoratorIdFunc = 'return $decorator->getElement()->getName(). "-element";';

In looking at the above, the getId() . "-element" version is semantically correct; getName(), when used with forms that utilize array notation, will return values such as "contact[foo]" which represent invalid DOM identifiers.

Can you give an example of the output you expected (based on previous versions) vs the output currently generated, and also an example of the JS and/or CSS you were using? This would help me better understand the problem, and whether or not it's something we need to change and/or accommodate within the framework.

Sorry for late answer.

The produced difference is:

with getName():

 with getId(): My opinion is that the problem is: \* ZF is considered to be stable \* if an project uses CSS dependent on this IDs it gets broken by commit #21893 \* there is no way to keep compatibility except to rework all CSS or to keep patched Zend\_Form\_Element in project I think getId() is more correct, but I would be very thank full if there could exists a way to keep compatibility.

Is anyone else having the same difficulties that Martin outlined? Is this something that should be remediated in 1.12?
