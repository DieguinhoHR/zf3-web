ZF-6418: Improve sort speed
---------------------------

### Description

As documented in:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.searching.html)

 Please use caution when using a non-default search order; the query needs to retrieve documents completely from an index, which may dramatically reduce search performance.

Is there any way that this can be addressed? I'm noticing a 10x slowdown in searches when using a non-default sort order.

Unfortunately, there are no way to increase speed there (except increasing document retrieving speed).

All documents has to be retrieved from index to get fields using for sorting. I could only recommend to reduce _stored_ information size (fields can be indexed, but not stored).

Splitting data between relational database and Lucene index is also good way.
