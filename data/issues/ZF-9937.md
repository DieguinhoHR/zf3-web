### Description

After updating from 1.10.4 to 1.10.5 i got a php warning:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    Line 812 is:


But $locale may not be an array for array\_key\_exists(). So I guess, just a ! is missing: ```

How can one reproduce the issue?

I got this error while calling: ```

$someArray is an array with two elements, 'cause the translation in my po-file has two placeholders.

Is $this->translate an object of Zend\_Translate? Or is $this a view helper?

Because Zend\_Translate does not support view operations and the second parameter for Zend\_Translate is the language and not a placeholder.

$this is an instance of Zend\_View. So $this->translate() calls the view helper.

Not reproduceable for me, wether in trunk nor in branch. Probably already fixed in past.
