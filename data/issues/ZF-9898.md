### Description

I'm currently trying to implement some Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider to do application jobs (like search indexing) and therefore require to use resources from the webapp bootstrap, i.e. db connection. That's the way I'm doing it a provider right now:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $profile = $this->_loadProfileRequired();
    $app = $profile->search('BootstrapFile')->getApplicationInstance();
    $app->bootstrap();
    $db = $app->getBootstrap()->getResource('db');


Right now, the environment which is used for the Zend\_Application instance generated in Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Zf\_BootstrapFile::getApplicationInstance() is hardcoded to "development" but I need another environment to run the job in.

I suggest to slightly modify Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Zf\_BootstrapFile::getApplicationInstance() in the following way to be able to provide the needed environment while remaining bc:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

                         );
                 }


Then I could simply set the environment within my provider:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $app = $profile->search('BootstrapFile')->getApplicationInstance('cli');


Any downside that I don't see?

This issue is frustrating when working with [~beberlei]'s zf-doctrine and doing anything migration related in any non-development environment

Yep. I want use zf-doctrine on staging/production server to database migrations. But it makes it difficult.

I can set APPLICATION\_ENV in command line "$ APPLICATION\_ENV=staging zf" And get it in the script from "getenv('APPLICATION\_ENV')"

I've done just that and edited it to pull the APPLICATION\_ENV with the getenv('APPLICATION\_ENV') function.

                         );
                 }
    ,
    


Now I just store an environment variable in my shell for APPLICATION\_ENV="local" and it will use the "local" environment in the application.ini file.
