### Description

Review phpDoc for API documentation generation.

Is the @const tag allowed?

Is the contruction:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**#@+
         * Plugin loader type constants
         */
        const DECORATOR = 'DECORATOR';
        const ELEMENT = 'ELEMENT';
        /**#@-*/


allowed? only for constant ?

Made SVN16865 for Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_ZendServer before opening this issue

@const is not a supported PhpDocumentor tag.

I know but there are some occurences (for example Zend\_Dojo ;) ). Do we remove them? I didn't found the information in coding standards.

Yes -- we should remove them or replace them with @var.

A quick search showed me that @const is still being used 25 times in 22 files. Should these be removed or renamed to @var? I also noticed that 2 occurrences in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter are defined as follows;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    * @constant integer
    


These occurrences are on lines 70 and 76
