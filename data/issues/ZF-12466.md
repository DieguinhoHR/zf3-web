### Description

In revision 25118 the file Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db is changed. With this change the Zend\_Db\_Table default adapter is set to a string instead of a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract instance.

These lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->isDefaultTableAdapter()) {
        Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($adapter);
    }


Are removed from 'init()' and placed into 'getDbAdapter()', and uses $adapter which is a string in this case.

Possible work around (application/Bootstrap.php):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function _initDb ()
    {         
        $aConfig = $this->getOptions();
           
        $oAdapter = Zend_Db::factory($aConfig['resources']['db']['adapter'], $aConfig['resources']['db']['params']);
            
        Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($oAdapter);        
    }

This is also happening to my systems. I have a database resource which automatically was instantiated by Zend\_Application, but since the last version of the file Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db there are only 500 internal server errors. I used the fix Milan provided above and this work arounds the problem (definately not fixing it!!).

Please revert the changes as quick as possible, this is main functionallity of the Zend\_Application component.

Fixed in 1.12 branch and trunk.

The change was not completely reverted -- it was just reworked so that it operates correctly.
