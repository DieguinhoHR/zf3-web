### Description

In many situations when you work with database and selecting some value from combobox (Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select) - you need transform the "0 => '-- no value --'" to null to be compatible with database reference integrity. Therefore there should be Zend\_Filter\_Null for such purpose. I suggest test value for empty() and return null

I had this same problem, first built a filter Null.

But thought best and construct filter DefaultValue.

I think that this case.

code example simple in the class Filter\_DefaultValue

\_\_construct( $defaultValue = null );

filter($value) { return $defaultValue; }

This does not work for the above described case. A "true" would in your case return "null" which is not wished behaviour.

sorry me, just gave a simple example.

I had the same problem in my Applications, this filter that built, solved my problem

 
    protected $_defaultValue;
    
    protected $_ruleApplyValue = array();
    
    public function __construct( $defaultValue = null , $ruleApplyValue = null )
    {
        $this->_defaultValue   = $defaultValue;
        $this->_ruleApplyValue = $ruleApplyValue;
    
        if( !is_array( $ruleApplyValue ) ){
            $this->_ruleApplyValue = array( $ruleApplyValue );
        }
    }
    
    public function filter($value)
    {
        if( in_array( $value , $this->_ruleApplyValue ) ){
            return $this->_defaultValue;
        }
    
        return $value;
    }


call

Zend\_Filter::get( 'test' , 'DefaultValue' , array( null , 'test' ) )
