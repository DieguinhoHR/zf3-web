### Description

Latest I have tried is on Thursday, Feb 19th, 2009 using a checkout from [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/)

I have traced the problem to be originating from the client (most probably the XmlRpc\_Request class), which mistakenly identifies the array being sent to system.multicall() to be a struct.

Please provide a simple, stripped down example of your service and client to give use a chance to inspect what's happening.
