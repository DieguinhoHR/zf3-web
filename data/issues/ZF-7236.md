### Description

In the description of the Zend Search Lucene scoring Algorithm, 'tf(t in d)' is described as Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Similarity::tf($freq), 'idf(t)' is described as Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Similarity::tf($term, $reader)

This looks like a typo isn't it supposed to be Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Similarity::idf($term, $reader)?

this occurs here:
