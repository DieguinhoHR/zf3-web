### Description

I consider this a bug and critical, because create\_function() is just another name for eval().

Zend\_Form\_Element::loadDefaultDecorators() uses create\_function() as of trunk and 2.0, its not in 1.9. Please remove it.

Fixed in r24427 in trunk and r24428 in the 1.11 release branch, and d2db390 on ZF2 master.
