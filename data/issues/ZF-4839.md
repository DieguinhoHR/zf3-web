ZF-4839: ControllerTestCase broken with PHPUnit 3.3.3
-----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-11-06T12:30:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-21T10:13:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase is broken with PHPUnit 3.3.3 (most recent version) in revision 12333. ControllerTestCase uses PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase::incrementAssertionCounter() in line 1099, but this method is not available any more with PHPUnit 3.3.3 (don't know in which version this was removed). The appropriate method in PHPUnit 3.3.3 is PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase::addToAssertionCount($count).

Fixed in r12372; now checks for PHPUnit version and calls appropriate method for that version.

Still not solved...

Line 1098 now reads

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (version_compare('3.3.3', PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), 'lt')) {


but must be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (version_compare('3.3.3', PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), '<=')) {

Um... no. We don't want <=, because at version 3.3.3 the change was introduced. Versions _less than_ 3.3.3 require the handling as originally written.

Please see my comments in the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
         * Increment assertion count
         * 
         * @return void
         */
        protected function _incrementAssertionCount()
        {
            $stack = debug_backtrace(); // why calling debug_backtrace() twice?
            foreach (debug_backtrace() as $step) {
                if (isset($step['object']) 
                    && $step['object'] instanceof PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
                ) {
                    if (version_compare('3.3.3', PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), 'lt')) { // if 3.3.3 < CURRENT_VERSION do
                        $step['object']->addToAssertionCount(1);
                    } else { // if 3.3.3 >= CURRENT_VERSION do
                        $step['object']->incrementAssertionCounter();
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
        }


But in PHPUnit 3.3.3 incrementAssertionCounter() is not available any more...

Sorry to bother you with this!

I've rewritten it to the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (version_compare(PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), '3.3.3', 'lt')) {
        $step['object']->incrementAssertionCounter();
    } else {
        $step['object']->addToAssertionCount(1);
    }


which should make the intention clearer.

We are running from an svn:externals of phpunit and it doesn't have a version there. Can this be some sort of other check, for example method\_exists or something?

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2008-12-05T08:13:41.000+0000

Sure. I'm reopening the issue so we can track that.

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2008-12-05T08:14:45.000+0000

Changing to trivial and improvement, as it will work for most users of PHPUnit as-is right now; the improvement is for those tracking svn of PHPUnit.

 

 

Posted by Brian Hazzard (bhazzard) on 2009-04-24T05:55:12.000+0000

I too have this issue. I tried changing the source code to the method\_exists approach and had no luck. I also tried a hack-fix of defining incrementAssertionCounter in my test class and simply calling addToAssertionCount(1) in it's body... again, no luck. Has this been resolved?

 

 

Posted by Brian Hazzard (bhazzard) on 2009-04-24T06:12:44.000+0000

In the meantime "upgrading" to PHPUnit 3.3.16 does indeed fix this problem.

 

 

Posted by Ivan Bonilla Cortes (ibonilla) on 2009-05-18T16:56:42.000+0000

This actually affects more users than those tracking svn of PHPUnit: Neither incrementAssertionCounter nor addtoAssertionCount exist on versions prior to 3.3.0 incrementAssertionCounter exists on versions 3.3.0 to 3.3.2 addtoAssertionCount exists on versions 3.3.3 and on

You may be wondering why someone would want to use an older version of phpunit. Sadly the latest version that ubuntu gnu/linux packages is 3.2.16: <http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/phpunit> so this bug affects all ubuntu users that want to use a package manager.

As mentioned in the previous comment, somewhat older versions of PHPUnit don't have any of these methods for the simple reason that not all distributions are as keen on keeping everything cutting edge as others :'(

If there's no alternate solution in versions before 3.3.0 of PHPUnit, I suggest a following 'fix':

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    if (version_compare(PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), '3.3.0', 'lt')) {
                        break; // Do nothing
                    } elseif (version_compare(PHPUnit_Runner_Version::id(), '3.3.3', 'lt')) {
                        $step['object']->incrementAssertionCounter();
                    } else {
                        $step['object']->addToAssertionCount(1);
                    }
                    break;

I'm setting the priority to major, as for there will certainly be many more people running distros like these...

I ran into this issue as well - using debian lenny, ZF 1.8 and the standard phpunit from apt-get which is 3.2.167. The patch from Dolf works perfectly for me (thanks!)

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2010-01-21T10:13:16.000+0000

Fixed in trunk and 1.10 release branch.
