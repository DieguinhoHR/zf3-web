ZF-10553: Problems with htaccess and Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Static
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There might be a problem with .htaccess described in [manual](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.backends.html#zend.cache.backends.static). When i type address like this: <http://zf/something>, cache works properly, but when there is trailing slash (<http://zf/something/>), cache is created but never used. This bug(?) can be fixed, by adding something like this

RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_URI} ^(._)/+$ RewriteRule ._ %1 [R=301,L]

in .htaccess file.

I'm working on Windows 7, Zend Server 5.0.3, Zend Framework 1.10.8.

There is another bug with htaccess. When accessing site without specified controller and/or action, everything works fine. When I enter index controller or index controller and index action, cache is made but never used.

<http://zf/> - works fine <http://zf/index> and <http://zf/index/index> - doesn't work

I've managed to make workaround of all problems with .htaccess file. Here is proper .htaccess file

DirectoryIndex main.php

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT\_ROOT}/static/index.html -f RewriteRule ^/\*$ static/index.html [L]

RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT\_ROOT}/static/%{REQUEST\_URI}.html -f RewriteRule .\* static/%{REQUEST\_URI}.html [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_URI} ^(._)/+$ RewriteRule ^._$ %1 [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -s [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -l [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -d RewriteRule ^._$ - [NC,L] RewriteRule ^._$ main.php [NC,L]

With this fix you need to change name of index.php file to main.php
