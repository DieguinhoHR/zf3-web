### Description

Would it be possible to allow the rename filter to accept params like prefix and suffix ?

so we would be able to upload file like :

{prefix}oldfilename{suffix).ext

that would be really helpful in many cases imo.

maybe even it would be possible to pass string filters to modify the filename ?

Not for 1.6.1.

If I had implemented all I have on my taskplan for this filter it would not be ready for the release.
