ZF2-194: $\_SERVER not defined in Zend\\Locale\\Locale::getBrowser
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

While working on fixing tests for Zend\\Feed, I noticed that Zend\\Locale\\Locale::getBrowser uses $\_SERVER to detect the language/locale. Given that this part of code comes from unit tests, $\_SERVER is not defined, thus we need a is\_array($\_SERVER) check before trying to use it.

Pull request is on it's way.
