### Description

in [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.write.lastinsertid) the first example should read $id = $db->insert('bugs', $data); as insert() returns lastInsertId

Yes, you could get the lastInsertId value from $pkData[$pkIdentity] .

But I worry about how to use slightly hard to understand

I don't think you understand what I was saying: {quote} $id = $db->insert('bugs', $data); {quote} That is the only needed line - you don't need anything else - $id already contains the value that lastInserId() would return anyway.

Zend\_Db\_Adapter::insert() does not return the lastInsertId, it returns the number of rows affected, which generally is 1.

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::insert(), on the other hand, does return primary key, which is typically the last insert id.
