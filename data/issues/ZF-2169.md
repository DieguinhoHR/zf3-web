Alex, can you please test with the latest revision from trunk ? And change your local "Format.php" within "Zend/Locale/" directory with the here attached one ?

Please return me the debug output for both tests.

THANKS

Debug Version

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-12-15T16:17:09.000+0000

Without the output of the attached debug version I will not be able to fix this error... If there is no response anymore I will close this one as it seems that it is then already fixed.

As I am not getting response since 27.November my own tests did not show this error I expect that it does no longer exist.

If it does, please reopen and give detail report of the attached debug version.

After adding a line to Zend/Locale/FormatTest.php that includes the TestHelper.php script for include\_path specification:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    phpunit --verbose Zend_Locale_FormatTest > Zend_Locale_FormatTest.out 2>&1


produced the output:

Debug Version for the new release

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-01-07T14:57:19.000+0000

testing comments....

Darby,

I don't know why now all comments are gone so I try to answer your comment from my memory:

Within my testbed I don't have to add an include... I can run phpunit Zend\_Locale\_FormatTest instantly. I was also not able to verify the behaviour that the output of "precstr" breaks the test.

Because the I18N core has been rewritten, I had also to change the debug version. The above mentioned problem does now no longer occur.

But the generated output is "VERY" complete. It would be best if you add the debug output as attachment so I can read through it. This new version must be tested with the latest SVN.

Thank you for your help on this one...

Comments should be OK now.

I can no longer reproduce the error messages, so it looks like this is fixed for me, too. Attaching latest output just in case it's useful. Thanks, Thomas! :)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-01-07T16:00:33.000+0000

I looked through the output and saw no problems. Eighter the changed default behaviour or the new LDML implementation has done it.

Anyhow, because it is fixed with the actual release, I will close this issue.

Fixed with SVN-7357
