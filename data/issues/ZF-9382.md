### Description

In Option section within Zend\_View reference guide chapter it was defined that the default value for the _encoding_ property is _ISO-8859-1_. However, in the Zend\\View\\Abstract.php class in line 115 the default value is _UTF-8_.

Stumbled upon this one today as well after figuring out Zend\_Filter\_HtmlEntities changed its encoding to UTF-8. After many attempts to find a fix I tried setting the encoding of the view to ISO-8859-1 and after that it all again worked like it was supposed to.

Please fix the docs, it's also wrongfully documented in 1.9.7. Encoding problems are a true nightmare.
