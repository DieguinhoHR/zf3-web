### Description

AMF3 calls will fail if the first or only parameter passed to the call is an object. These are calls from Flash, Actionscript 3 netConnection

The fix to the problem seems to be to remove the check on line 184 of Request.php.

Can you supply the simplest code snippet for PHP and AS3 to make this happen. I have an object test that works fine in AS3 from Flex and can not re-create the issue.

Changes have been committed to the trunk that resolve the issue. Test case was created and committed.
