### Description

The proposed viewhelper that should be implemented, mentioned in the performance-guide on

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.view.html#performance.view.action.model)

implements a method named "direct()". Following the documentation of the view helpers, the method should be named after the name of the view helper class.

This is confusing and obviously wrong.

Actually, in 1.6, we added a direct() method to Zend\_View\_Helper\_Abstract. If that method is available, it will be used; otherwise it falls back to the method/classname mapping.

I'll update the docs to reflect this.

Mea culpa -- while we added the direct() method to Zend\_View\_Helper\_Abstract, we did not add handling of it to Zend\_View\_Abstract. I've updated the documentation in the performance guide to remove its usage.
