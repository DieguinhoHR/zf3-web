ZF-3298: Brackets "[]" in element name
--------------------------------------

### Description

By default Zend\_Form strips brackets "[]" from element name and I do not have any ideas how to build such form using Zend\_Form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SMS1
    Number: 
    Message: 
    
    SMS2
    Number: 
    Message: 
    ...

    <pre class="highlight">
            $form->addElement('text', 'number', array(
                'isArray' => true,
            ));


Can't find how to delete my issue...

The brackets are stripped out to allow for overloading. You provide them by setting the 'isArray' property of the element: $element->setIsArray(true). This setting hints to the view helper to treat the element as if it were an array (i.e., should contain brackets in the markup).

I know all that u said, but now Zend\_Form does not provide functionality to build form like this using isArray or SubForm:

{quote} SMS1 Number: Message:

SMS2 Number: Message: {quote}

I asked this question in mail list and did not get answer: [http://nabble.com/Zend\_Form\_Element-isArray-td1736…](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Form_Element-isArray-td17364270.html)

Ooops! Just noticed this one is already resolved. Just chalk that assignment up to bookkeeping. ;)
