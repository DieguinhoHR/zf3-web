### Description

Zend\_Text\_MultiByte::strPad() gives a warning when pad\_length is negative or less than input string. Results in a warning "str\_repeat(): Second argument has to be greater than or equal to 0" and returns the input string.

Return value is as expected but should not give a warning.

From str\_pad() doc page: "If the value of pad\_length is negative, less than, or equal to the length of the input string, no padding takes place."
