ZF-5803: Class 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection' not found
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-02-16T13:09:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-22T11:03:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When calling a class like Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Array before any other Zend\_XmlRpc subclass (eg : Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client, Zend\_XmlRpc), php gives fatal error : "Class 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection' not found" The problem resides in the require\_once order : first is called Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Array which require\_once Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection which require\_once Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value which require\_once Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Struct which require\_once Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection -- well, it's already required so skip this one then Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Struct tries to extends Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection but the file still is not loaded, because we are deep down the including process. So the Class Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Collection cannot be found.

Possible fix would be to require mother class Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value before anyone else.
