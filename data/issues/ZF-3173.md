### Description

It seemed to make sense to me that the HeadTitle helper should be doing translation when it's cast to string, and it was pretty trivial to implement. Thoughts?

I can see a benefit to this, definitely. However, I can also see this leading to unexpected results when people are unaware that it translates.

I think a better solution would be to have an accessor via which you can enable or disable translation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->headTitle()->enableTranslation();
    
    // optionally, even set the specific translation object:
    $this->headTitle()->setTranslator(...);


I'm going to schedule this for the next minor release.

Here's a patch that should be doing things more properly. Sorry about the lazy patch before, I am a lazy lazy man. :) One last thing I am wondering... would it be possible (or wise) to try pulling the translator from a registered Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate object in addition to the Zend\_Registry key?

(Replacement patch) Or, we could try not requiring Zend/Registry.php twice. Sigh. Sloppy copy & paste on my part.

No this would not be wise, because the official registry key to use for the translation adapter within all other components is "Zend\_Translate"... ;-) See the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate helper for details.
