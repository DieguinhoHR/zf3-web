### Description

With default "automatic\_cleaning\_factor" (10, from Core) and "automatic\_vacuum\_factor" (10, from Backend\_Sqlite), the _SQLite cache backend_, using _in-memory databases (":memory:")_ will _fail 1 time out of 100_ (100 = 10 \* 10, 1%) when attempting a "clean()" operation.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $failures = 0; $attempts = 100000;
    foreach (range(1, $attempts) as $i) {
        $cache = Zend_Cache::factory(
            'Core', 'Sqlite',
            array(),
            array('cache_db_complete_path' => ':memory:') // in-memory database
        );
        $success = $cache->save('cache_data', $id = 'cache_id');
        $failures += ($success ? 0 : 1);
    }
    printf('Failures: %d (%.1f %%)', $failures, ($failures / $attempts) * 100);


 
    <pre class="literal">
    (100000 attempts)
    Failures: 1008 (1.0 %)


The problem comes from _Sqlite::\_automaticVacuum()_, where a call to "_sqlite\_close()_" will _remove all tables from the database_, but the value of "$this->_\_structureChecked_", set by "$this->\_checkAndBuildStructure()", in "clean()" (previous to the "automaticVacuum" call), \*will still be "true"\*. So the SQLite backend will re-open a new connection, but the \*tables will not be created again\*. Thus the occasional "table not found" errors while "\_query()"ing, 1 time out of 100.

Disabling automatic vacuum "patches" the immediate problem, but a real fix would look a little bit more like this :

There is no need to close db connection after VACUUM

fixed in r24347 (trunk) and r24348 (1.11 branch)
