Unfortunately, the server cache does not do what I intended it to when I originally coded it. The problem with performance is due to the fact that it must both re-instantiate objects as well as perform reflection on all of them -- but in reverse order (reflection objects are what are cached).

I would like to address this in the future; would you be willing to put an issue in the tracker, so it doesn't get lost, but also so that I can ping you about testing?

In the meantime, you have a couple of options:

- First, don't use the server cache
- Make sure you _are_ using an opcode cache
- Consider setting up functionality to cache read-only methods, so that the XML-RPC server can be bypassed entirely for such calls.

Resolved in trunk. Usage remains the same. However, the server now stores the internal method mapping definition without requiring the Reflection objects used to generate it. This now nets a gain in performance when using Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Cache.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
