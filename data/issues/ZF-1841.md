### Description

You cannot specify the type of the argument in the where function Here is the function from Zend\_Db\_Select :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function where($cond)
        {
            if (func_num_args() > 1) {
                $val = func_get_arg(1);
                $cond = $this->_adapter->quoteInto($cond, $val);
            }


this should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function where($cond)
        {
            if (func_num_args() > 1) {
                list($cond, $val, $type) = func_get_args();
                $cond = $this->_adapter->quoteInto($cond, $val, $type);
        }
