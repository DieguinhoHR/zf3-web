### Description

When setting max size to 2gb or greater generates the following problem:

2gb: 'Zend\_Validate\_Exception' with message 'The maximum must be greater than or equal to the minimum filesize, but -2147483648 < 1024' Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size->setMax('2GB') #1

3gb: 'The maximum must be greater than or equal to the minimum filesize, but -1073741824 < 1024' Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size->setMax('3GB') #1

4gb: The maximum must be greater than or equal to the minimum filesize, but 0 < 1024' Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size->setMax('4GB') #1

It you specify 5gb the \_max property is set to 1gb, if 6gb then its 2gb and repeats the previous behavior. Doesn't matter if you specif bytes instead of using "short notation".

As mentioned in the manual PHP is not able to support more than 4GB on a 32bit machine. Depending on the used processor and OS the actual supported size can differ from 2GB up do 16GB.
