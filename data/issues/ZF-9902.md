I also had this problem. Here is my quick fix. Now if you use "appendXXXX" or "prependXXXX", then the content is appended or prefixed in XXXX(separated by commas). Unfortunately, it does not work with offset functions and you couldn't delete one entry from the enumeration. Therefore, it is not a general solution. Not yet ...

I think the HeadMeta should work on this cases similar with headTitle, so can specify a separator (setSeparator) and to generate only one tag, not multiple...

Every meta tag could have a 'lang' attribute, so you could define keywords or whatever in different languages. You need sometimes more than one meta tag with same name.
