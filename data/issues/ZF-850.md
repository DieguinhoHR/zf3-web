### Description

There are a few loop <--> data type incongruences in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Item::\_\_construct().

1. Lines 108 - 113
 

    <pre class="highlight">
            $result = $xpath->query('./az:EditorialReviews/az:*', $dom);
            if ($result->length == 1) {
                foreach ($result as $r) {
                    $this->EditorialReviews[] = new Zend_Service_Amazon_EditorialReview($r);
                }
            }


If $result->length must be == 1, why $this->EditorialReviews[] is an array and it's generated using a foreach loop? Probably EditorialReviews can be more than one or the code should be fixed in order to use $result->item(0)->data. See, for example, SalesRank lines 94-97.

1. Lines 115-120
 

    <pre class="highlight">
            $result = $xpath->query('./az:SimilarProducts/az:*', $dom);
            if ($result->length == 1) {
                foreach ($result as $r) {
                    $this->SimilarProducts[] = new Zend_Service_Amazon_SimilarProduct($r);
                }
            }


Same as section 1.

1. Lines 122-127
 

    <pre class="highlight">
            $result = $xpath->query('./az:ListmaniaLists/*', $dom);
            if ($result->length == 1) {
                foreach ($result as $r) {
                    $this->ListmaniaLists[] = new Zend_Service_Amazon_ListmaniaList($r);
                }
            }


Same as section 1.

Issue is stylistic; code works. Assigning priority of 'trivial'.

I agree that the issue is stylistic in nature, updated the summary, and assigning fix version of 0.9.2.

As I make my way through unit testing and reviewing the Zend\_Service\_Amazon component code, I see that it is not just a stylistic issue. In fact, there exists the possibility of more than one entry for the data indicated in the description. I change the priority to Major since this bug prevents functionality for which a simple workaround is not apparent.

I believe this issue to have been resolved with [SVN r4357](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=4357). If this is not the case, please feel free to reopen with additional comment.
