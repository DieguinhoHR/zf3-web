### Description

Hello,

that IDEs like Zend Studio can support the suggestion, the return value has to be declared, from which class the instance is returned.

Example Zend\_Http\_UserAgent:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @return Zend_Http_UserAgent_Device $device
     */
    public function getDevice()


Now the IDE can support the suggestion of methods from this class instance.

This is just an oversight. All other methods are properly documented.

Thank You for reporting. Solved at SVN r23728, 23729 with setServer($server).

Because setServer was explained as: Retrieve the "$\_SERVER" array .
