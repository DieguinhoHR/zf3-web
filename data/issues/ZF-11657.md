### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.form.decorators.simplest.html#learning.form.decorators.simplest.first-decorator)

Component: Programmer's Reference Guide Section: Decorator Basics Subsection: Creating Your First Decorator

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected $_format = '%s'
                       . '';


The source code example does not work, because string concatenation operations are not allowed for class attribute definitions.
