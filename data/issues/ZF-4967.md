### Description

In a Zend\_Db\_Table object:

$this->select()->limit(0,4)->\_\_toString();

Will give you

SELECT `table`.\* FROM `table` LIMIT 9223372036854775807 OFFSET 10

for both pdo\_mysql and mysqli adapters. Values of one and above work as expected.

I see my problem was assuming ->limit(a,b) translated to "LIMIT a, b" in SQL, whereas it really becomes "LIMIT b OFFSET a".
