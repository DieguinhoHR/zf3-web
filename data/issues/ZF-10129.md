ZF-10129: Problem with verifying a submit button's "checked" status

### Description

Hello,

I ran into an issue with verifying whether a submit button was clicked or not. First of all, here is how I create the form in the form class's init() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('DOWNLOAD_ARCHIVE');
    ...
    ...
    $this->addElement($element);


I then create an object of the form in my controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new App_Form();
    if ($form->getElement('DOWNLOAD_ARCHIVE')->isChecked()) {
        //do some stuff if submit was clicked
    }


The isChecked() method doesn't work out correctly because I am using Zend\_Translate to translate the value of my submit buttons. For example, the "DOWNLOAD\_ARCHIVE" element name(= the displayed text on a button) gets translated to "Download archive" or "Archiv herunterladen" . Problem now is, that the isChecked() method looks into the request if the value of the button was submitted. In my case, it looks whether "DOWNLOAD\_ARCHIVE" is part of the request array or not. But it is never, because the array value of "DOWNLOAD\_ARCHIVE" is never "DOWNLOAD\_ARCHIVE" but either "Download archive" or "Archiv herunterladen" .

I solved this by not using the isChecked() method but like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->_request->getParam('DOWNLOAD_ARCHIVE', null) !== null) {
        //do some stuff if submit was clicked
    }


Unfortunately that would make the isChecked() method unneccessary. I hope this is an actual error and not simply a wrong use of the components by me. If you need any further information, feel free to ask.

Not sure where you are populating the form? the form itself as an object doesn't actually know what data has been passed. You need to get it and populate the form.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data = $this->_request->getParams();
    $form->populate($data);  


Alternatively, if you've got any validation code there

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data = $this->_request->getParams();
    if ($form->isValid($data)) {
    }

I only skipped this code. Actually, my form has three submit buttons. Two of them need to whole form to be valid and the above one only needs one element to be valid. This is why I am only validating this one element:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($form->getElement('ID')->isValid($this->_request->getParam('ID', null))
            && $form->getElement('DOWNLOAD_ARCHIVE')->isChecked()
    ) {
        //do some stuff if submit was clicked
    }


When submitting the form through one of the other two submit buttons I am actually validating the whole form.

I think this can be closed as non-issue. I misunderstood Kathryn's last comment and was actually using the isChecked() method incorrectly. Sorry for the inconveniences.

Resolving as not an issue - per Rene's comment.
