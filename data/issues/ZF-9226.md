### Description

Currently ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_AjaxLink is usefull, but not that useful. If you need anything else than a hyperlink tag with a JQuery request, you'll find yourself writing JQuery instead. Also, Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url return a url which can be used in many situations. You'd expect to find something like ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_Url then, not ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_AjaxLink which then returns an entire hyperlink tag.

ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_AjaxLink will be abstracted into ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_RequestAbstract. AjaxLink will then be recreated implementing RequestAbstract. Also ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_Request will be created, which will basically just return an inline JQuery function.

This is as per discussion with the ZendX\_JQuery maintainer Beberlei.

Patch attached; first implementation. Needs some polishing but all unit tests (at least those of Zend\_JQuery\_View\_jQueryTest) pass. Also some new tests need to be added and the documentation needs editing.

Time for bed for me now so I thought I'd submit this working patch as a peak :)
