### Description

When using isUploaded() to check whether a file has been uploaded, rather than return false (as documented) if the file has not been uploaded, a Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception is thrown. The Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception' has the message "'file' not found by file transfer adapter".

I believe that the function should just return true or false if the specified file has not been uploaded.

The exception stems from the \_getFiles() method.

Looks like it the $noexception parameter needs to be set to true.

The isUploaded() method also needs to test for empty return value from \_getFiles() before looping through it. Actually, can't the isUploaded() just return (bool) \_getFiles($files)?

Not reproducable with trunk. Seems to be already fixed.
