ZF-4584: limitPage with order
-----------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-13T03:08:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-27T09:34:22.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

$select = $this->\_db->select(); $select->from(array('u' => 'UserComments')); $select->joinLeft(array('us' => 'Users'), 'u.commenterId = us.userId'); $select->joinLeft(array('a' => 'Avatars'), 'a.userId = u.commenterId AND a.default = 1'); $select->where('u.userId = ' . $userId); $select->order('u.created DESC'); $select->limitPage($limitPage, $limit);

The following query is taken with $select->\_\_toString() method and it will produce fatal error. If executed directly in MySQL, it won't produce any errors.

SELECT `u`.\* , `us`.\* , `a`.\* FROM `UserComments` AS `u` LEFT JOIN `Users` AS `us` ON u.commenterId = us.userId LEFT JOIN `Avatars` AS `a` ON a.userId = u.commenterId AND a.default = 1 WHERE (u.userId = 1) ORDER BY `u`.`created` DESC LIMIT 4 OFFSET 12

If I use ASC instead of DESC in order, no errors are produced. If I'm not using limitPage, no errors are produced. Tested with Framework versions 1.5.3 and 1.6.1. MySQL 5.0.45-community-nt.

UPDATE: The issue was fixed with adding arrays of selected columns to $select->leftJoin to not include duplicate column fields in the SELECT.
