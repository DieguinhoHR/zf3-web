ZF-12394: Zend Tool 'zf' command has erroneous use of Windows' HOMEPATH variable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This is the search order for zf, from the --setup argument:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        Home Directory:
            - ZF_HOME, then HOME (*nix), then HOMEPATH (windows)


For me, it's falling back to HOMEPATH, however these are my (default) Windows 7 variables:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    HOMEDRIVE=U:
    HOMEPATH=\


With that combination of variables, it cannot create or find its configuration files as it is NOT taking the U: bit into account, and also it fails anyway trying to create it in C:.
