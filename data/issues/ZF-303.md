### Description

Reported by Kevin McArthur:

 
        I think i've sourced another small bug in the RewriteRouter.
    
        <a rel="nofollow" href="http://url.com/test/abc%34asdf/def">http://url.com/test/abc%34asdf/def</a>
    
        $router->addRoute('test/:type/:something', array('controller' => 'test',
        'action' => 'index'));
    
        This causes the router to try to noroute action (when theres a urlencoded
        value in the url for a parameter)
    
        In fact the url should appear as
    
        <a rel="nofollow" href="http://url.com/test/abc4asdf/def">http://url.com/test/abc4asdf/def</a>
    
        to the router, and the value should properly end up in the type parameter as
        'abc4asdf' as it does if its not encoded.
