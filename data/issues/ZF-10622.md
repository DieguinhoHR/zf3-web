### Description

See the attached example, coming from a user report. The client asks the service for its phpinfo() string (in the example it is simulated with a static file which had triggered the problem) The phpinfo() in the example has special characters in the values of PROMPT and RPROMPT in the Environment section, which causes the Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client to break with 'Unable to parse response'
