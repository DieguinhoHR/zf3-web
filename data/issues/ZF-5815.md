### Description

The following Test fails, cache entry still exists after 2 seconds:

class CacheTest extends PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase{

 
    public function testApcTtl(){
        $cache = Zend_Cache::factory( 'Core', 'Apc',
                                      array( 'cache_id_prefix' => 'test_cache',
                                             'write_control' => false,
                                             'automatic_serialization' => true ),
                                      array() );
        $this->assertTrue( $cache->save('Hallo', 'tst', array(), 1 ) );
        $this->assertEquals( 'Hallo', $cache->load('tst') );
        sleep(2);

I reproduce this but this is not a Zend\_Cache issue

In "apc.php" administration interface for example, expire time is correct

If you load the cache on another page, you will get a "false" (correct behaviour)

The problem seems to be that the save() method and the load() one are on the same page ?

Hi Fabien,

you are right. It is a kind of "feature" from APC. The issue is exactly described here: <http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=13331>
