### Description

The wikification script does not delete chapters which are no more present in SVN...

See Old PAGE: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=13655) New PAGE: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=13979)

It should erase old pages if there are no comments added. But I dont know what to do with added comments... maybe also be erased.

Or extract them and email them to anybody ;-)

However, deleted pages should not be presented anymore in wiki.

 

 

### Comments

i intentionally commented out the code that deleted old wiki pages, because we didn't want to loose comments. Perhaps extracting them and mailing them to one of us would be just fine. The person we receives these comments can then add them to the docbook files.

Thoughts?

I expect that a page is not deleted if the content is changed... Only if the page header (sect1 title) is changed the page will be deleted... right ??? Otherwise the page is reworked and the comments will stay as they are.

Then I would expect the comments mailed.

Another option might be to move deleted chapters to be children of a special wiki page, like "retired doc pages" or something. Then the pages can be deleted manually at some future time, after any comments have been reviewed and integrated into the documentation in some way.

Bill, that's a good idea!
