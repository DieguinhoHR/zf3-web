### Description

I've been using Zend\_Mime to generate MM7 messages for MMS distribution and encountered that the module lacks genericness and is very specific to Email.

1) $body = 'This is a message in Mime Format. If you see this, ' . "your mail reader does not support this format." . $EOL;

Why should a generic MIME message be tied to Email? IMO, this line should be removed.

2) Mime\_Message::generateMessage does not generate the multipart header info for the overall message. This is missing too.

3) I have seen this issue in the mailing lists before, but there should be an interface to create nested, generic mime messages.

4) Separation of Zend\_Mime and Zend\_Mime\_Message is unclear.

Depends on merging with Zend\_Mail\_Message, which is planed after 1.0

ad 1) This message will only be displayed by "clients" (programs, ...), that unterstand the mail message format (RFC 822), but not MIME. AFAIK only old or very minimal mail clients do this. MMS clients, et cetera should ignore it - it's called discard-text in RFC 2046.

ad 3) It is possible to create nested multipart messages. But it seems it's not so clear how. This will be fixed with the merge with Zend\_Mail\_Message.

It seems to be one of issues for next major release (2.0) for me :)
