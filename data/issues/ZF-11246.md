### Description

When you want a custom message for a validator, you can't have already a translation for the messageKey. The problem is in the Zend\_Validate\_Abstract class on line 219.

{quote} if ($translator->isTranslated($messageKey)) { $message = $translator->translate($messageKey); } else { $message = $translator->translate($message); } {quote}

For example: When I want to use the Identical validator and I want to provide a custom message for the "notSame" error on form 1 (example: "My custom message"), but on form 2 I want a default message. Because of the default message on form 2 I define a translation for "notSame". But now, because I translated the "messageKey" my custom message will not be available.

I found already a ticket [\#3313](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3313) that solved this issue, but since the 1.10.6 it was reversed. I don't understand why?

When you want to use 2 validators of the same type you must simply create and use 2 validators with different options.

How translation is processed has no effect of the validators usage. In your case you would have the same problem when you use messages instead of keys. This is the reason why your peoposed change will not be added.

For details you should give an reproduceable example of your problem. Otherwise this issue will be closed as wont fix.

Closing as not reproduceable as there is no further response from the reporter
