ZF-2947: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite sql escaping
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-22T17:16:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-04-05T03:30:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

None of the methods in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite preform sqlite\_escape\_string on any passed in values.

This causes errors if the passed values into any methods contain single quotes.

It also opens the cache up to sql injection attacks.

data are alrealy escaped

tags and cache ids are not escaped because there are "protected" by \_validateIdOrTag() of Zend\_Cache\_Core

so this patch is not necessary

thanks anyway

Although this is not an issue if used though the Zend\_Cache\_Core, if used directly ID's and tags are open to SQL injection attacks.

I don't see anything wrong with airing on the side of caution here and making the Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite behave securely by correctly escaping id's and tags, to allow for use on it's own. Rather than only allowing the safety of security though Zend\_Cache\_Core.

direct use of Zend\_Cache backends is not supported
