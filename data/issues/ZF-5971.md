ZF-5971: Make Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db test DB connection

### Description

I'm actually surprised that Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db doesn't test the DB connection before using it. Also, it doesn't even catch any exception from Zend\_Db, which could lead, in some rare cases, to infinite loops.

Consider a Zend\_Log that logs DB connection errors. What if a Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db has been provided into it , and the DB is down ?

2 things :

The heavy one would be to use in the Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db's constructor

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try {
        $this->_db->getConnection();
    } catch (Zend_Db_Exception $e) {
       // some stuff like throw new Zend_Log_Exception($e->getMessage());
    }


That is heavy as it requires a physical connection to the DB even if it won't use it in the future.

The lighter code could be to write such a code at the time the query is done, aka \_write() method, resulting in a sort of redefining the Db\_Exception to a Log\_Exception, it looks better I think.

I'm not seeing what the problem is here. We could catch the Db\_Exception and throw a Log\_Exception, but this looks like yucky exception chaining; I don't see any benefit. Could you please elaborate on the scenario in which you'd get an infinite loop?

Well there is none. Anyway ErrorHandler throws the exception out of the Frontcontroller, so such a code is not a problem :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try {
       $obj->something(), // a DB exception is thrown here
    } catch { Zend_Exception $e) { // but I want a wide catch
       $log->log($e); // $log has a db backend, it will throw an exception
    }


Such a use case can happen in an MVC app where ErrorHandler widely catch exceptions to log them. Anyway, a try catch should be done on the log operation as well, all right for me
