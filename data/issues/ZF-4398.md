Care to elobarate? give any details? code snippets? For me Soap Server and Client work perfectly together.

I thinks it's to early to close it. Issue is opened just two weeks ago.

Aris: Could you provide some details?

For me it is working for simple example. I call methods which are without arguments and it is working. If i put arguments in method and on client side i call this method with arguments i dont get any result. Method in the class is written like :

/\*\* \* Method getString \* \* @param string $str1 \* @return string \*/ public function getString($str1) { return $str1; }

Mathew Turland : Did you test the code with passing arguments to the methods ?.

Please give a more complex case of your server and client setup. additionally use getLastResponse() and getLastRequest() on the client to view the XML that was sent and report it.

Are you using WSDL or NON-WSDL Mode?

For me it works even with complex cases.
