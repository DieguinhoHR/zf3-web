### Description

Production environments frequently have more than one database. If we do not support the equivalent of mysqli\_select\_db(), then we force the edge (web) servers to open multiple, simultaneous connections to the DB for the same situations where a typical PHP application would only require one. Doubling or tripling the number of active connections to the DB is a potential show stopper issue for production environments with high volume. Thus, I don't see "creating multiple ZF DB adapters, one per DB" as a solution. Note that we are talking about database instances inside the same RDBMS (system or cluster), and we are not talking about different RDBMS (e.g. MySQL vs. Oracle), which would require two different ZF DB adapters.

Hi David,

I have not found a PDO equivalent to mysqli\_select\_db(). We do not have an equivalent in the MySQL PDO adapter.

<http://php.net/pdo>

The new ZF mysqli DB adapter by Eugene Panaitov found in the incubator/ of the developer release could be extended to provide what you seek.

<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-381>

Cheers, Gavin

P.S. We should be posting DB stuff to fw-db@lists.zend.com.

Reassigning to Eugene. Eugene is currently working on the all new mysqli DB adapter available via SVN.

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Rewording summary. The request is not possible with PDO-based adapters, so it is a specific feature request for the Mysqli adapter.

This also applies to RDBMS-specific drivers, including Oracle, DB2, and Postgres.

A workaround exists.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paramArray = array(
      'username' => 'u', password = 'p',
      'dbname' => 'database1'
    );
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('MYSQLI', $paramArray);
    
    $db->getConnection->select_db('database2');

Assign to Bill Karwin.

No special support will be implemented for this feature request.

The workaround exists to choose the database using the underlying connection, as described above.
