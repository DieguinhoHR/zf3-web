### Description

It would be cool if the SPL ArrayAccess feature will also be added to this nice Class.

As ArrayAccess implementation doesn't allow the object to be used with the array\_XXX() functions, I think that there is very little benefit in adding this functionality to Zend\_Config.

If you need an array, then Zend\_Config::toArray() will generate one for you.

Have I missed a use-case where ArrayAccess makes something possible or much easier than the current access functionality?

The reason is very easy, because if you use other templating system (ie. smarty) its not possible to make things like $config->value->subvalue

$config.value.subvalue is possible this the one reason the other reason is, you can extend the class with more features and logic. Otherwise change the constructor from Zend\_Config calls to self:: calls because it makesit very hard to build around this class with such an nested forced type.

We use {$obj->property} with no problems within Smarty with our ZF application. What error message are you getting?

[system] application.name = "TestApplication" application.version.major = 1 application.version.minor = 0 application.version.revision = 156

this is a config application example

this results in an object that looks like this:

Zend\_Config Object ( [\_data:protected] => Array ( [application] => Zend\_Config Object ( [\_data:protected] => Array ( [name] => TestApplication [version] => Zend\_Config Object ( [\_data:protected] => Array ( [major] => 1 [minor] => 0 [revision] => 156 ) ) ) ) ) )

to access this in a smarty template you can just use $config.version.major and not $config->version->major

the way to build a own abstraction is easy like class my\_config extends Zend\_Config implements ArrayAccess { public function offsetExists($offset) public function offsetGet($offset) public function offsetSet($offset, $value) public function offsetUnset($offset) }

but the parent constructor from Zend\_Config does stuff like $this->\_data[$key] = new Zend\_Config($value, $this->\_allowModifications);

this makes it impossible to get a deep recursion with my own abstraction. The way to overload the constructor are possible but is not the clean way. It would be better to change the constructor and implement the arrayaccess feature to add own functionality like a config object with methods and array access.

{if $config->hasVersion()} {$config->version->id} {/if}

just one example ... :)
