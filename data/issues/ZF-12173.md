### Description

I've migrated my personal library to namespaces and I've detected that the namespaced prefix paths are not properly handled by the plugin loader because both Zend\_Form and Zend\_Form\_Element add "\_$type" as suffix to the plugin path when they should detect if the namespace separator is \_ or \\

I've submitted two diff files, one for tests and one for the fix itself. Note that this issue depends on ZF-11330, so the fix for ZF-11330 should be applied in order to make this one work.

Hi Antonio, your patch does not include:

- Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha::addPrefixPath()
- Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::addPrefixPath()

I've fixed the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File and Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha addPrefixPath methods too.
