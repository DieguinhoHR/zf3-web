ZF-2236: Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable - support for Oracle
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-11-26T10:36:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T12:08:59.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The select statement returns to be invalid for Oracle and Pdo\_Oci. Even though we try to fix the adapter as shown in <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1509>. The reason for that is the quoting in the select statement comes all wrong. Also the authenticate method returns FAILURE\_CREDENTIAL\_INVALID because the "zend\_auth\_credential\_match" variable has to be in uppercase to work with Oracle or Pdo\_Oci.
