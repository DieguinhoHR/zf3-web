Unit tests are generally done.

Font testing has to be added. Following fonts may be used for redistributing with ZF unit tests: [[http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/â€¦](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/)] License info also has to be included: [<http://www.xfree86.org/current/LICENSE11.html#34>]
