### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/15>

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql:: describeTable() is currently calling an non-existing method $this->\_describeTable

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function describeTable($table)
        {
            $sql = "SELECT * FROM $table LIMIT 1";
            return $this->_describeTable($sql);
        }


it should be something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
         /**
         * Returns the column descriptions for a table.
         *
         * @return array
         */
        public function describeTable($table)
        {
    
        $sql = "SELECT a.attnum, a.attname AS field, t.typname AS type, "
                 . "a.attnotnull AS isnotnull, "
                 . "( SELECT 't' "
                 . "FROM pg_index "
                 . "WHERE c.oid = pg_index.indrelid "
                 . "AND pg_index.indkey[0] = a.attnum "
                 . "AND pg_index.indisprimary = 't') AS pri, "
                 . "(SELECT pg_attrdef.adsrc "
                 . "FROM pg_attrdef "
                 . "WHERE c.oid = pg_attrdef.adrelid "
                 . "AND pg_attrdef.adnum=a.attnum) AS default "
                 . "FROM pg_attribute a, pg_class c, pg_type t "
                 . "WHERE c.relname = '{$table}' "
                 . "AND a.attnum > 0 "
                 . "AND a.attrelid = c.oid "
                 . "AND a.atttypid = t.oid "
                 . "ORDER BY a.attnum ";
    
            $result = $this->fetchAll($sql);
            $descr = array();
            foreach ($result as $key => $val) {
                $descr[$val['field']] = array(
                    'name'    => $val['field'],
                    'type'    => $val['type'],
                    'notnull' => (bool) ($val['isnotnull'] === ''),
                    'default' => $val['default'],
                    'primary' => (bool) ($val['pri'] == 't'),
                );
            }
            return $descr;
        }

Hi,

I did something similar for Pdo\_Mssql. Just in case you are not aware, the type in the returned array needs to return the length in brackets if it's a varchar. At some point, I expect a length field to be added though :)

Regards,

Rob...
