### Description

A getCategories method on Zend\_Feed\_Reader\_FeedInterface and Zend\_Feed\_Reader\_EntryInterface would be very useful. A cursory glance shows that both Atom and RSS support categories.

Support for both Feed and Entry level categories (via getCategories()) added to trunk. Will be formally released in 1.10 since it's new to the API.

Someone owes me a beer ;).
