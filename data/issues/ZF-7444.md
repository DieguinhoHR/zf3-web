### Description

Currently Zend\_Db\_Select does not allow infinitly complex conditions in the where clause. Its not really possible having a combination of OR and AND Statements.

I propose a solution, which is derived from the "sfPropelFinder" plugin: [http://symfony-project.org/plugins/â€¦](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropelFinderPlugin/0_3_0?tab=plugin_readme)

Its a new method combine(), which aggregates two or more named conditions into one, using either AND or OR as operation. Here are the unittests of the patch, which show 3 use-cases:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testSelectTwoAndThenOr()
        {
            $select = $this->_db->select();
            $select->from("zfproducts")
                   ->where("name = Foo")
                   ->where("name = Bar")
                   ->orWhere("name = Baz");
            $sql = preg_replace('/\\s+/', ' ', $select->__toString());
            $this->assertEquals('SELECT "zfproducts".* FROM "zfproducts" WHERE (((name = Foo) AND (name = Bar)) OR (name = Baz))', $sql);
        }
    
        public function testSelectWhereTwoNamedCombineOr()
        {
            $select = $this->_db->select();
            $select->from("zfproducts")
                   ->where("name = Foo", null, null, 'cond1')
                   ->where("name = Bar", null, null, 'cond2')
                   ->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2'), 'or');
            $sql = preg_replace('/\\s+/', ' ', $select->__toString());
            $this->assertEquals('SELECT "zfproducts".* FROM "zfproducts" WHERE ((name = Foo) OR (name = Bar))', $sql);
        }
    
        public function testSelectWhereCombineNamedCombine()
        {
            $select = $this->_db->select();
            $select->from("zfproducts")
                   ->where("name = Foo", null, null, 'cond1')
                   ->where("name = Bar", null, null, 'cond2')
                   ->combine(array('cond1', 'cond2'), 'and', 'cond3')
                   ->where("name = Baz", null, null, 'cond4')
                   ->where('name = Lala', null, null, 'cond5')
                   ->combine(array('cond4', 'cond5'), 'and', 'cond6')
                   ->combine(array('cond3', 'cond6'), 'or');
            $sql = preg_replace('/\\s+/', ' ', $select->__toString());
            $this->assertEquals('SELECT "zfproducts".* FROM "zfproducts" WHERE (((name = Foo) AND (name = Bar)) OR ((name = Baz) AND (name = Lala)))', $sql);
        }


Test 1 shows, that the proposed change is fully backwards compatible with the "orWhere" condition. Maybe that can be deprecated for 2.0 then.

This would be a great update for 2.0! I've been needing this feature since the start on my new project on ZF. I don't like using raw queries anymore.
