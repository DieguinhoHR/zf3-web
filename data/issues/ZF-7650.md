### Description

When I tried to get zero items from Array\_Queue, it returns 1 item

Here is sample code to reproduce the issue

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $queue = new Zend_Queue('Array');
    $queue2 = $queue->createQueue('queue');
    
    $queue->send('My Test Message 1');
    $queue->send('My Test Message 2');
    
    $messages = $queue->receive(0);
    foreach ($messages as $i => $message) {
        echo "$i) Message => ", $message->body, "\n";
    }


To fix the issue "if" condition from line 240 should be moved up to the beginning of the "foreach" loop (line 231)

I would never think to test for this.

Fixed unit test to bring it in line with ZF testing guidelines. Divided up tests/Zend/Queue/Bugs/ZF-7650Test.php, placing code for each adapter in the respective Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Test.php file.

Committed to trunk r24328 Merged to release-1.11 in r24329
