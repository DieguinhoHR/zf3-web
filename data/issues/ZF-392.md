ZF-392: Zend\_Db will error if your table colums have "\_"

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract insert function will not create prepared statements correctly if your table columns are named with "_" ie table\_name. The placeholder becomes :tablename and throws an exception. The function works appropiately if the str\_replace("_"... is removed from the $sql property on line 122. I'm not sure it this will cause problems elsewhere, however.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
