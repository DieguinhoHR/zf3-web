### Description

I'm not sure if it's the correct behavior or not but if you set notEmptyMessage in the options array and you use a validation rule which handle empty message like Zend\_Validate\_Alpha the "generic" message notEmptyMessage will not be use in favor of which handle Zend\_Validate\_Alpha::STRING\_EMPTY.

By setting notEmptyMessage in the options I was expecting to have the same message for all empty value.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data = array('title'=>'');
    
    $validators = array(
        'title' => array('Alpha', 'presence' => 'required')
    );
    
    $options = array(
        'missingMessage'  => "Le champ '%field%' est manquant",
        'notEmptyMessage' => "Le champ '%field%' est requis"
    );
    
    $input = new Zend_Filter_Input(null, $validators, $data, $options);
    
    print_r($input->getMessages());
    // Output
    // Array ( [title] => Array ( [0] => '' is an empty string ) )

Changing to 'Unassigned'

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

There are actually a set of additional issues: \* Zend\_Filter\_Input skips ALLOW\_EMPTY metacommand processing if any validator is applied to the field - [ZF-6708]; \* Zend\_Filter\_Input doesn't process messages -> validators mapping correctly - [ZF-6709]. \* Zend\_Filter\_Input skips ALLOW\_EMPTY metacommand processing if rule refers several fields - [ZF-6711] \* Zend\_Filter\_Input skips validators processing if ALLOW\_EMPTY metacommand is set to true - [ZF-6713]

Fixed.

ALLOW\_EMPTY overrides other validators processing now. The same behavior is described in the documentation.

Empty fields are never processed by rule validators. If field is empty and it's allowed, then other validators processing is skipped. If field is empty and it's not allowed, then corresponding message is set.
