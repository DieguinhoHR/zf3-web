ZF-10643: Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface contains commented count()

### Description

Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface contains the method signature and docblock for count() but the signature is commented out.

This is irritating because an IDE would return the docblock for Countable::count(). There should either be a note in the methods or class' docblock why it is commented out, or the method + her docblock should be removed completely or the comment removed.

You can't redefine the count() method in the child interface when it has already been defined as abstract in the parent. It throws a PHP fatal error:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    PHP Fatal error:  Can't inherit abstract function Countable::count() (previously declared abstract in Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Interface) in /Zend/Paginator/Adapter/Interface.php on line 31


The only solution is as to suggest - remove the commented method signature or explain the comments why it was removed. I've attached a patch to remove it.
