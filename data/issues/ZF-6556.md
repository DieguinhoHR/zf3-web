### Description

This issue has already been resolved. Sorry.

I did search to see if this issue has already been submitted but I didn't find anything.

- - - - - -

The 'resources' property of the application.ini code sample appears as 'resource' in the first sample code box (its missing an 's') of [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)

This has been reported twice already, and is fixed in our repository; we will push the fixes to the site no later than the 1.8.1 release next week.
