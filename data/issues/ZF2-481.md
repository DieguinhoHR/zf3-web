### Description

I need to add a maintainer to [http://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/â€¦](http://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zendrest) with rights on the github repository to add a GitHub Service Hook

(in the future, I will not add by myself repository (if I'm not an admin of the package) to the packagist, I will do it on my local packagist server if the package is not present on packagist).

ZendRest is deprecated, and will be removed once ZendServiceTwitter has been refactored to use the HTTP client directly.

Additionally, we publish all ZF packages via our own repository, not via packagist (the only packages on packagist are dev packages of the full framework).
