### Description

Simpy ceased operation more than two years ago (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpy>)

It can be removed from ZF now. I don't think it is necessary to throw exceptions as for removed Google services ([http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Removing-Zend-Gdata-Gbase-and-Zend-Gdata-Health-td4610232.html)). If someone didn't realize, that API they are using does not work for two years, they are not likely to upgrade to new ZF.

Patch to remove Simpy

It also needs to be removed from docs, but I'm afraid I would break the Docbook tables, where the Simpy is listed.

Resolved in SVN r24837.
