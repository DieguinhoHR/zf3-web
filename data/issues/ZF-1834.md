### Description

Christer Edvartsen writes:

Is there any reason why you don't do a return $this; in the rewind() method of the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract class?

It would be neater to do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $this->fetchAll($where)->rewind()->current();


instead of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rows = $this->fetchAll($where);
    $rows->rewind();
    $row = $rows->current();


When someone writes their own fetchAll() method to do some looping over the Rowset and then return it and forgets to do a rewind() this might be useful.

You wouldn't need to call rewind() directly after a fetchAll() but I can see this would be a useful addition.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all closed issues to the person who ultimately fixed them.
