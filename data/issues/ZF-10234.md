ZF-10234: Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain does not make routes available

### Description

Currently there's no way to get routes out of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain. Once they're in, they're not coming out.

In my case I need to determine the route defaults. (so I can inject them in my Zend\_Navigation pages - to workaround the issue that Zend\_Navigation needs route defaults to determine active page)

You may probably want to create abstract routes (see documentation) to access them. Anyway, I'm not touching the old router anymore in regards of improvements, as all or most of the issues will be resolved with the new router in ZF 2.0.

Cheers for the quick reply. Can't get custom chain routes to work though. Either the Router throws up when I specify a custom chain class, or it goes ahead and uses the original one anyway (since the Zend chain route classname is hardcoded in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract)

I don't exactly get what you mean by creating abstract routes, can't seem to find anything about it in the docs.
