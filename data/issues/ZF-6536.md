### Description

Copy paste from article on devzone: Allow toggling error suppression. We feel -- and the greater PHP community does as well -- that error suppression is a bad idea. It's expensive, and it masks very real application problems. So, by default, we want it off. However, if a developer insists that it be on, we should allow toggling it on.

Copy paste from docs: By default, Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader does no error suppression when using its internal autoloader, which utilizes Zend\_Loader::loadClass(). Most of the time, this is exactly what you want. However, there may be cases where you want to suppress them. You can do this using suppressNotFoundWarnings():

Autoloader.php line 78. protected $\_suppressNotFoundWarnings = true;

Thank you for the report; I'm already aware of the issue and have it marked as a todo for 1.8.1.
