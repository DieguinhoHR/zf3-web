### Description

The changes made in ZF-204 and released in Zend 0.8 introduced a bug where all queries using database schemas in dot notation will fail.

For example, this query would work fine in 0.7 but produce an error in 0.8:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from('some_schema.some_table', '*');


In older versions, where the table would have been represented like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT FROM some_schema.some_table


it is now represented like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT FROM "some_schema.some_table" some_schema.some_table


Which is a problem for two reasons. (I am using Postgres, but I'm assuming this will also be problematic with other databases)

Firstly, having dot notation in the alias is not allowed. To fix this I extended Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join so that if the table supplied is not an array, it is first converted to an array with the correlation field having periods replaced with underscores.

Secondly, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quoteIdentifier simply adds quotes around the given identifier, which breaks dot notation. Instead of "some\_schema.some\_table" it must be "some\_schema"."some\_table" To fix this, I extended quoteIdentifier() so that it first splits the identifier on periods, then quotes them and re-joins them.

These fixes are fine for me as a stopgap, but I don't know if they are feasible for you, as I haven't considered the broader implications.

Ah, I just found this after also reporting the issue on the original ZF-204. You may want to check out the additional comments I've left there. Sorry!

Here is a patch that adds additional behaviour to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quoteIdentifier() to solve the qualified identifiers issues, ie. 'schema.table' or 'table.column' or even 'database.schema.table'!

Individual identifier segments, separated by a dots, are quoted when the $qualified argument is set to true. Example:

$adapter->quoteIdentifier('schema.table') returns: "schema.table"

$adapter->quoteIdentifier('schema.table', true) returns: "schema"."table"

I've also adapted Zend\_Db\_Select to use this mode for table names, and also switched the associative array (tableName => correlationName) to (correlationName => tableName).

(This was originally posted on ZF-204, but that issue was closed, so I thought it more appropriate to post it here, and explain the patch better)

This issue is resolved as of revision 3795.

Identifiers that contain a dot (".") character are automatically split on the dot(s), and each piece quoted separately. Thus identifiers support the "schema"."table" or "table"."column" syntax.

If you have a database design that has table names or column names containing a dot character, this should be a very uncommon case, and it is not recommended. But you can work around it by using Zend\_Db\_Expr and quote the identifier yourself.
