### Description

Hi, I realy miss some posibility how to set default decorator for elements. For example i need render form as a table.So i create elements, add them to form and now i can call addDecorators() but it can overwrite some specific decorators which i set before, so i must redeclare them (or i can add all element to form at first, after it call addDecorators and after it set other parametrs but i think that it's very ugly way :-) ) I think that we realy need a posibility to set some default decorators which will be used if they aren't specified explicitli.

I read the manual but i didn't find a posibility how to do it now.

Thanks

Please, please read the manual more closely; there are _many_ places where it covers exactly this.

For instance, Zend\_Form\_Element::setDecorators() will overwrite any previously set decorators. Zend\_Form::setElementDecorators() will set the specified decorators as the decorators for all registered elements. Additionally, using configuration (config arrays or Zend\_Config options), you can pass in the decorators an element will use at instantiation time -- which bypasses the default decorators entirely.

I can't follow the reasons Radek wrote but I have to agree that a _static_ setDefaultDecorators would be nice to have
