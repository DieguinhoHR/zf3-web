ZF-7759: Some Mssql Number types fail to insert due to quotes 
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-02T07:08:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:22.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Mssql 2008 fails to insert using the insert method due to quotes. Mssql can convert Double and Int but throws an error for money and small money types.

Ex:

_Table_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE dbo.testMoney
        (
        id int NOT NULL IDENTITY (1, 1),
        paid money NOT NULL
        )  ON [PRIMARY]
    GO


_Insert.php_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MoneyTable extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
     protected $_name = "testMoney";
    }
    
    $db = new MoneyTable;
    
    $data = array('paid' => 5.25);
    $db->insert($data);


_Query Created (taken from sql profiler)_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    INSERT INTO "testMoney" ("paid") VALUES ('5.25')


This causes Sql Server to fail since the 5.25 is in quotes. The query should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    INSERT INTO "testMoney" ("paid") VALUES (5.25)

What adapter & driver are you using?

freedts on ubuntu. I adjusted the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql and changed the \_pdotype to be dblib.

This appears to be an issue inside of MSSQL. I am still looking into what the issue with MSSQL to find out why this is failing. I actually found that on a table of mine with 4 money fields, it wanted me to CAST for only 1 out of those 4 fields.
