    <pre class="highlight">
    
    set_include_path('/srv/apache/htdocs/user/christian/tests');
    
    require_once('Zend/Loader.php');
    
    function __autoload($className) {
       Zend_Loader::loadClass($className);
    }

    try {
        $tr = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp('localhost');
        Zend_Mail::setDefaultTransport($tr);
        
        $mailer = new Zend_Mail();
        $mailer->addTo('your@mail.com');
        $mailer->setFrom('reply@mail.com', 'Reply name');
        $mailer->setSubject('mail bug');
        $mailer->setBodyText($body);
        $mailer->send();
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        throw new i21_Exception($e->getMessage());
    }
