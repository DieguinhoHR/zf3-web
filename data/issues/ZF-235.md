### Description

In the function save() in the class Zend\_Feed\_EntryAtom there is a problem with the usage of an uninitialized variable in line 150. The line looks like this:

throw new Zend\_Feed\_Exception('XML cannot be parsed: ' . $php\_errormsg);

The variable $php\_errormsg has not been initialized in the context of the function save() nor was it passed to the function as a parameter.

See comment from Willie Alberty for Issue [ZF-237] [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-237?page=all)

$php\_errormsg is a predefined PHP variable that exists whenever the track\_errors configuration option is enabled (see [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/…](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.php#reserved.variables.phperrormsg) ). track-errors is always enabled in this function on line 146.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
