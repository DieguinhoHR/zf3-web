### Description

There is a problem when you use multiple stacked Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action calls such as following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        public function a1Action()
        {
            $this->view->sub = $this->view->action('a2', 'test');
        }
       
        public function a2Action()
        {
            $this->view->sub = $this->view->action('a3', 'test');
        }
    
        public function a3Action()
        {}
    }


I call view helper from a controller because of better exception handling than in a view.

The above code executes proper actions but renders improper views for the actions. For all actions the a3 script is rendered. The reason is that the action helper always modifies the request object changing an action. In fact, the request object is cloned in the helper but only once - in the constructor.

I'm attaching a patch.

Please note that the problem can also affect other inner objects such as a dispatcher or a response.
