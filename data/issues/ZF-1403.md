### Description

My php doesn't work with sslv2 transport, but work with sslv3 transport. Change "ssltransport" to "ssl" in Adapter config and php automaticaly select success transport.

From php.net: {quote} ssl:// will attempt to negotiate an SSL V2, or SSL V3 connection depending on the capabilities and preferences of the remote host. sslv2:// and sslv3:// will select the SSL V2 or SSL V3 protocol explicitly. {quote}

The default adapter has been changed to 'ssl://' several days ago - please update to the latest snapshot or wait for the next release.
