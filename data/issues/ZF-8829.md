### Description

I use code like this:

echo $this->escape('A string containing minimal one special sign like trademark (™)');

in phtml script.

When I switch my library tag back to Zend Framework 1.9.6 the CORRECT text is echoed.

However, when I switch to the latest 1.9.7 tag this text completely disappears!!

For this reasing I can't work with 1.9.7.

Please let me know if you need more info.

Regards Richard Noya.

Which PHP Version are you using? There is a known bug with PHP 5.2.0, which was fixed until 5.2.6 or such.

My suspicion is that the character is a Latin-1 character.

What happens if you set your view's encoding to 'ISO-8859-1'? You can do this via the view object itself:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->setEncoding('ISO-8859-1');
    // or, in a view script:
    $this->setEncoding('ISO-8859-1');


or, if you're using Zend\_Application, via your configuration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.encoding = "ISO-8859-1"


Please try this and report the results.

If that works, then your solution is to do one of the above. If not, we need to investigate further.

I use Zend\_Application. I already had the view encoding on ISO-8859-1

But for other reasons I can't recall right now I also implemented this line:

phpSettings.default\_charset = "ISO-8859-1"

Sorry, looked wrong, your suggestion indeed works! Putting the line resources.view.encoding = "ISO-8859-1" in the config file, solved the problem!!

Can you please explain, why this has to be done only in 1.9.7?

Rgds Richard.

Yes: we changed the default encoding to UTF-8 due to security implications. You can read more about it in the [related security advisory:[http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/…](http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2010-01)], which also details the suggestions I made to you in my previous comment.

(This information was also included in the README.txt in the distribution.)
