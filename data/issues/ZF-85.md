ZF-85: Query Parser not handling fieldbname with underscores
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-21T06:49:13.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

parsing a query such as:

$query = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse('title:bob');

correctly creates a private term with field set to title and value to bob like so: [\_term:private] => Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term Object ( [field] => title [text] => bob )

However if the field contains an underscore it tokenizes from the underscore for example:

$query = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse('title\_en:bob');

gives: [\_terms:private] => Array ( [0] => Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term Object ( [field] => contents [text] => title )

 
            [1] => Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_Term Object
                (
                    [field] => en
                    [text] => bob
                )
    
        )


This may be expected behaviour. Maybe underscores should be banned from index fields. I was using them because we've a bilingual collection so my fields are: title\_en title\_gd contents\_en contents\_gd etc. ( which has been fun trying to work around inability to set default field!)

But it would strike me that the use of ctype\_alnum to decide on token types in QueryTokenizer may be a tad stricter than necessary.

Esoteric one this I'm sure though. Probably the only person in the world who's used underscores in their fields :)

Anything happening on this issue? If so, set a fix version with the expected time frame it will come in, otherwise assign to Alex. Thanks. I'm setting fo r 0.3.0 in the meantime.
