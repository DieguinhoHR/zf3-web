i found that possible bug in 1.5 version but in 1.7.8 is reproducable also. i hope that is bug and no bad date/time math from my side.

When you think that the wintertime->summertime change is a bug then you are right.

But then also your clock, and every other clock around the world has this bug.

As all known clocks have this bug we can finally conclude that it is not a bug, but well-known and expected behaviour.
