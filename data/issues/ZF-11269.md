### Description

Page [http://zendframework.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://zendframework.com/manual/en/zend.tool.usage.cli.html), last section, environment locations. It states, that there are two environment variables that control where zf.{sh,bat,php} looks for Zend framework, namely ZF\_INCLUDE\_PATH and ZF\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_PREPEND.

This is incorrect, as zf.php, in function \_setupToolRuntime, near line 338 shows that these variables are named ZEND\_TOOL\_INCLUDE\_PATH and ZEND\_TOOL\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_PREPEND.

This should be fixed either in the documentation (so that it reflects reality) or in zf.php (so it's consistent with rest or environmental variables)

Too ZF\_STORAGE\_DIRECTORY should be replaced by ZF\_STORAGE\_DIR.
