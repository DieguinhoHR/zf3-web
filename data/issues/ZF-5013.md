### Description

Currently the docs have:

setGotoSimple() can be used to set a default URL to use if none is passed to gotoSimple().

gotoSimple() expects an action to be specified at the minimum as a first argument, so it's misleading to state that none may be passed to it.

It might be better to write about the setGotoXXX routines as a common set:

The Redirector helper can be configured with a default value for the redirection destination using the setGotoSimple, setGotoUrl, and setGotoRoute methods. Any subsequent calls to the redirectAndExit method will use the last configured destination.

setGotoSimple sets the destination in terms of the MVC's module, action, and controller. For example, setGotoSimple('bar', 'foo') will set up the redirection to go to /foo/bar, relative to the current host and application root.

setGotoUrl sets the destination in terms of the typical URL string, and setGotoRoute uses the FrontController's router to return the URL for the specified options. Assuming a route named 'profiles' had already been configured to handle requests such as <http://localhost/profiles/martel>, you can establish the redirect destination with a call to setGotoRoute(array('username' => 'martel'), 'profiles').
