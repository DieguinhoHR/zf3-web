### Description

When searching using ? as a placeholder e.x. "nic?s" using the highlightMatches Method throws a warning: Wrong parameter count for array\_merge() in xxx\\Search\\Lucene\\Document\\Html.php on line 400

line 400 is: $wordsToHighlight = call\_user\_func\_array('array\_merge', $wordsToHighlightList);

My Fast-Fix: $wordsToHighlight=array(); if (count($wordsToHighlightList)>0) $wordsToHighlight = call\_user\_func\_array('array\_merge', $wordsToHighlightList);

Same thing also happens with \* so it's all wildcard searches that hit this problem when used in conjunction with a term hilighting.

I can confirm that the fast-fix worked perfectly so my thanks for that.
