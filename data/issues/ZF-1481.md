### Description

I am marking as major b/c ive seen this come up alot with the introduction of view renderer.

Sample Exception (taken from mailing list):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_View_Exception' with message 'script 'index/index.phtml' not found in path' in
    > E:\Localhost\DVDCollector\library\Zend\View\Abstract.php:853 Stack trace:
    > #0 E:\Localhost\DVDCollector\library\Zend\View\Abstract.php(764):


I think it would be a good idea to include the script stack (in the same fashion that require or include does) when an exception of this type is thrown.

I propose the output look like this: assuming this script stack: 1. ./user/modules/blog/views/scripts/ 2. ./user/templates/views/scripts/

script 'index/index.phtml' not found in path (./user/templates/views/scripts/:./user/modules/blog/views/scripts/)

separated by PATH\_SEPARATOR.

Or something similar.

message me if this needs more clarification.
