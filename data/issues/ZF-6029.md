This is not a problem of Zend\_Framework. We tried also in past with Zend\_Guard and had to switch to ioncube encoder which had no problems with ZF.

It's a shame but it seems like Zend\_Guard does not completly resolve the obfuscated class names in some cases of inclusion.

I agree with Thomas . I tried with Zend Guard 5.0.1 and Zend Studio 6.1.1 and Zend Framework 1.7.8 (latest version at today), But I can not reproduce this issue.

It can be a issue of

- Used Zend\_Guard version
- Used Zend\_Framework release
- Used OS
- Used PHP release
- Used configuration settings for Zend\_Guard

In past, with ZF 1.5, I was able to track down the problems and finally solve them for Zend\_Guard and the releases we were using (even if we switched the encoder).

Eigther way... when the reporter is not able to track down the problem I see no chance to reproduce this as it seems completly version/OS depending.

Today I retried but I can not reproduce this report with following.

Zend Framework revison - 14667 from trunk (05/April/2009) Zend Guard 5.0.1 Target Optimizer - 3.3.0 Delete phpdoc block - No Delete line number - No hard to read variables - No hard to read functions - No hard to read classes - No Windows XP Service Pack2

Maybe I got something wrong. From the description I learned that the File \\Zend\\Controller\\Action\\HelperBroker\\PriorityStack.php is affected. I also experienced this Issue with Zend Guard and Zend Framework. If obfuscation type 'Classes' is checked dynamic calls to Classes are not Possible any more. For instance routines like $class = "Some\_Class\_" . ucfirst( strtolower ( $type; ) ); $obj = new $class(); will fail. In terms of ZF calls to action helpers will fail due to the plugin loader.

Kind regards, Chris
