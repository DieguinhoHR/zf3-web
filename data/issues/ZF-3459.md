### Description

Is it possible to set different lifetime for separate router? I.e:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $frontendOptions2 = array(
       'lifetime' => 10,
       'debug_header' => false,
       'regexps' => array(
           '^/$' => array('cache' => true, 'lifetime' => 20),
           '^/new/' => array('cache' => true, 'cache_with_get_variables' => true),
       )
    );


For '^/$' we set lifetime 20sec, and for' ^/new/' by default 10.
