ZF-12407: Content Length Inserted Into Content When No Content-Length Header Is Set
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

After the first 8192 characters of a response in which no Content-Length header is set, a hexadecimal code indicating the length of the next chunk of characters is inserted into the response body. For example, after the first 8192 characters, the hexadecimal code 2000 is inserted into the body. 2000 converted to decimal is 8192, indicating that 8192 more characters are in the next chunk. After that chunk, the hexadecimal code inserted is 26, which is 38 decimal. This indicates that the last chunk of the response body is 38 characters.

I have found that the buffer limit happens in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket::read (line 465 - see snippet below):

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    // Fallback: just read the response until EOF
    } else {
    
        do {
            if($this->out_stream) {
                if(@stream_copy_to_stream($this->socket, $this->out_stream) == 0) {
                      $this->_checkSocketReadTimeout();
                      break;   
                 }
            }  else {
                $buff = @fread($this->socket, 8192);
                if ($buff === false || strlen($buff) === 0) {
                    $this->_checkSocketReadTimeout();
                    break;
                } else {
                    $response .= $buff;
                }
            }
    
        } while (feof($this->socket) === false);
    
        $this->close();
    }


I have not been able to find where the chunk length is being inserted into the response. The workaround for us was to add the Content-Length header, but it seems that there is still a bug since the chunk length should not be inserted into the response.
