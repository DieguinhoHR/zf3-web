### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object sets it's public properties as camelCaps of column names in database table. The existence of those properties cannot be checked either with isset() or property\_exists():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $table->find(1);
    
    if (isset($row->foo))
         echo $row->foo;
    else
         echo "Column foo doesn't exist";


The isset() or property\_extists() functions will alwyas return false even when the "foo" column exists. Adding the following \_\_isset() method to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row class enables to use native PHP isset() function to check for column availability:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __isset()
    {
        $under = array_search($camel, $this->_info['cols']);
        return isset($this->_data[$under]);
    }
