ZF2-343: input type checkbox, doesn't get checked when populating form

### Description

When populating form elements with setData only the value field gets written. This works fine for most input types but not for the checkbox. For this element the value field is the value posted if checked. IMHO what most people want when populating the element is to check it or not according to the set value. This worked just fine with the old form API, but now it doesn't and I can't find any other way of doing this with the current API, I'm guessing this was not intend so I marking it as a bug. My solution for now was to write a view helper (formCheckbox) with the value set by a special attribute 'post-value' and adding a 'checked' if (value == post-value). (I'm implementing a very similar solution for dojo dijits since these are also broken due to the changes in the form API).

Paulo, do the "options" attribute and the "useHiddenElement" attribute help at all for your use case?

An example of custom values:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        // Inside a Form...
        $myCheckboxElement = new Element('mycheckbox');
        $myCheckboxElement->setAttributes(array(
            'id' => 'mycheckbox',
            'type' => 'checkbox',
            'useHiddenElement' => true,
            'options' => array(
                'checkedValue'   => 'customCheckedValue',
                'uncheckedValue' => 'customUncheckedValue',
            ),
        ));
        $this->add($myCheckboxElement);


Unchecked would result in a value of: "customUncheckedValue". Checked would result in a value of: "customCheckedValue".

The problem is that setData only changes the Value attribute, this will work fine in most input elements but not for the checkbox.

Here is an example: let's say you want to store a boolean value in a database, so you write a form with a checkbox (if checked it posts TRUE (1) otherwise it posts FALSE (0), now you store this into the database. Everything works fine here. But now you want to edit that value, so you read the database and set the edit form with setData, now the checkbox will not be checked (although you set the value to TRUE). This is even worse if you store FALSE in the database, when populating the edit form the checkbox will be unchecked and the value will change from TRUE to FALSE, so even if you check it it will post FALSE, not TRUE.

Like I said I solved this by adding a new View Helper for the checkbox element, I can send a pull request with a fix, but I would like to make sure this is a valid solution first.

"The problem is that setData only changes the Value attribute, this will work fine in most input elements but not for the checkbox."

I'm failing to see why the "options" and "useHiddenElement" wouldn't work for you here. In the example I posted above, the custom values are detected just fine from setData and the checkbox reacted as I would expect.

1. Set up the form 1a. Add a element (type checkbox) with "options" attribute specifying the checked/unchecked values, and set "userHiddenElement" to true (to return the unchecked value).
2. Get your data (from database, postback, etc.)
3. Call $form->setData() with your data.
4. The View $this->formCheckbox($form->get('mycheckbox')) renders the correct state.

When using values other than true/false with a checkbox, it is essentially the same behavior as a Select input with two options (checked/unchecked). When you set up the form, you give it the two values it should expect for it's two states.

For the case when the checked state should produce reversed values (checked => false, unchecked => true):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $myCheckboxElement->setAttributes(array(
            'type' => 'checkbox',
            'useHiddenElement' => true,
            'options' => array(
                'checkedValue'   => false,
                'uncheckedValue' => true,
            ),
        ));

If I'm missing something here I'd suggest sending a pull request so we can take a look-see at the solution you have in mind. :)

Ah!, so when I open this issue (6/Jun) this view helper was not available (added in the following commit 8/Jun ): [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/f093b2eabe31da99f3c87fadb7a4d6794e558d00)

So, this fixes it. It works a little bit different from my own solution (I was only adding a new attribute), but it works ;D
