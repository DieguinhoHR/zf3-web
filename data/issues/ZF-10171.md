### Description

When running ./runtests --html dir (that's generating html coverage report after unit tests), I received several fatal errors, due to missing require\_once calls that should include the dependencies:

- Zend\_Application\_Exception is required in Zend/Application/Resource/Exception.php
- Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Manifest\_ProviderManifestable is required in Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Manifest.php

Mere adding corresponding require\_once's fixed the issues.
