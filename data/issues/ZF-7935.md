### Description

Hi,

I had the following problem and found this old post on Nabble. It should be done already but the Doc is still not corrected.

Cheers,

Phil

    <pre class="highlight">
     require_once 'Zend/Form.php';
    
     $form = new Zend_Form;
     $form->addElement('text', 'username', array(
         'validators' => array(
             'alnum',
             array('regex', false, '/^[a-z]/i')
         ),
         'required' => true,
         'filters'  => array('StringToLower'),
     ));

    <pre class="highlight">
     if (isset($options['messages'])) {
        $messages = $options['messages'];
        unset($options['messages']);
     }

Inside isset(), PHP casts 'messages' to an int, so it's the same as isset($options[0]), which is the character '/'! Since the isset passes, unset fails because you can't unset a character from a string.

> My feeling is that isset should be fixed, but for the time being, a Zend\_Form\_Element fix is simple:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     if (is_array($options) && isset($options['messages'])) {
        $messages = $options['messages'];
        unset($options['messages']);
     }


... [show rest of quote]

There are two things going on here. First, the supported way of passing constructor options in Zend\_Form\_Element::addValidator() is to pass an array of constructor values. So, you're getting this error because you're passing things incorrectly. Try this instead:

 
    array('regex', false, array('/^[a-z]/i'))


However, obviously the Quick Start is incorrect, so please file an Issue in the tracker noting this -- and I'll fix the docs, as well as add an explicit cast of the constructor options to an array.

Diffs for the documentation error and for the Zend/Form/Element.php

I have implemented the proposed fix. Did you have something else in mind Matthew?
