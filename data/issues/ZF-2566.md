-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-04T15:45:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-05T14:25:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

/\*\* @param string|integer|array|Zend\_Date $date \*/ Zend\_Date::set($date, ..) calls $zone = $this->getTimezoneFromString($date);

but if $date is integer, will throw an error on preg\_match on line 1324.

rolling back with: svn merge -r7768:7757

Sorry, but your textual problem is not reproducable because set() is no static method and preg\_match returns false and does not thow an exception...

Please give example code for reproduction, your php version and your used OS.

Thank you

$date = new Zend\_Date(time());

I'm sorry, used :: just as a way to reference method of the class, as **METHOD** shows it for instance methods.

Still not reproduceable... It could have to do with your php version or os which you forgot to give, or with your installation.

I checked with 2 versions of php and also phpunit does not throw an exception. Do you have pcre disabled ? Have you run unittests on any other components which also use pcre ? It would also help to know which exception is thrown.

PHP Version 5.2.3 PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) Support enabled PCRE Library Version 7.0 18-Dec-2006

Ok, maybe our ZF versions differ. I'm working with [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/library/Zend) Revision: 7797

The code in question is attached below: As you can see the method "set($date)" calls method "getTimezoneFromString($zone)" which will run "preg\_match('/([+-]\\d{2}):{0,1}\\d{2}/', $zone, $match);" when $zone can be integer.

Sorry, but there are still some informations missing for reproduction. Please give us your OS and the exception which you are getting.

Zend\_Date:1333: $tz = new DateTimeZone($match[count($match) - 1]);

when $match[count($match) - 1] == 1202229163

new DateTimeZone(1202229163); - gives unhandled warning

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T10:39:57.000+0000

So.. it looks like it doesn't catch this warning in try { } catch { } for some reason..

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T10:46:56.000+0000

Ok, found the problem - custom error handler, apparently it doesn't account for try { } catch { }... RESOLVED

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T11:12:10.000+0000

on 5.2.3 custom error handler receives catched exception as warning: <http://paste2.org/p/13074>

Now in custom handler i need to distinguish between catched exceptions and real warnings...

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-05T12:27:44.000+0000

So this problem would have occured anywhere within the framework as soon as an exception has been caught.

Please keep in mind that setting an extra error-handler overrides all set standard behaviours from php. This is no error, this is expected behaviour as with an own error handler you have to decide which error / warning is right and wrong.

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T13:26:18.000+0000

Actually it is not expected behaviour, but a bug that affects all Zend internal classes (including DateTimeZone), which do not account for EH\_THROW mode when handling errors.

Exceptions should be handled by set\_exception\_handler($callback), and not by set\_error\_handler($callback).

You can see here the patch diff, which when applied makes 5.2.5 work correctly: <http://paste2.org/p/13081>

And here's the PHP bug issue: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44053>

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T13:43:35.000+0000

Maybe you should use @timezone\_open($match[count($match) - 1]) to quiet the warning until this issue is resolved in PHP.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-05T13:45:34.000+0000

I'm sorry, but this is no bug of ZF and can not be solved by us.

ZF is open source... PHP is not... and we are no employees of Zend. Most of us core developers are private people. ;-)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-05T13:52:07.000+0000

Using the error-supression handler is depreciated as it does not work when you are using a self defined error-handler.

We have had such issues already in the past, so this would be no solution for us.

 

 

Posted by Moshe (moshe) on 2008-02-05T14:12:04.000+0000

Ok, i've solved this problem for me, this is my last post in this issue, unless response is requested.

Just as a sidenote, in my error handler i'm checking:

 
    $errno = $errno & error_reporting();
    if ($errno == 0) return;


So error-suppression would work for me :)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-05T14:25:56.000+0000

Fine... :)

If possible I would have helped out. But I think with your comments anyone with the same problem is able to fix this himself.
