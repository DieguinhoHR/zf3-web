### Description

I built a custom Zend\_Form class. I noticed that if I pass the string '0' the method setDescription the involved form-element will consider it as empty and I can't get to echo out its value in the element description.

Ex. $element->setDescription('0'); //$element is an object of type Zend\_form\_element\_Image
