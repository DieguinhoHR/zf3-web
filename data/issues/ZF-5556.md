### Description

There is no way to allow brackets on setName() function.

See this example: $cat= new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select('cat[]'); //I have overrided helper -> this will call setName($name) and this function calls ->filterName($name); this will filter the brackets and I cant make the system no to filter although it goes thru "public function filterName($value, $allowBrackets = false)"

What about such definition in Zend\_Form\_Element?

public function setName($name, $allowBrackets = false){ $name = $this->filterName($name, $allowBrackets ); ... }

and in construtor: "public function \_\_construct($spec, $options = null)" there can be condition on it: ... if (is\_string($spec)) { $withBrackets = null; if (is\_array($options) && isset($options['allowBrackets])) $withBrackets = $options['allowBrackets]; $this->setName($spec, $withBrackets); } ...

Names internally cannot have brackets as they are used in a variety of lookups. However, you can indicate that an element represents an array -- which will propagate to the view helpers and result in having brackets in the output. You do this by setting the isArray flag on the element:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->setIsArray(true);


Or, at instantiation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('foo', array(
        'isArray' => true,
    ));


both will result in the final output having the following attributes in the markup:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    name="foo[]" id="foo"
