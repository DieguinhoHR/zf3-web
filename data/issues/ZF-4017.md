### Description

Hello,

I think that on of the things that user will need, will be rich text editor element that would fall back to textarea.

I made a helper for this, it's really crappy, but works. I think it's really important the Editor, and is really easy implement this small feature.

Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_Editor extends Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_Dijit
    {
        public $helper = 'Editor';
    }
    
    class Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor extends Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Dijit
    {
        protected $_dijit  = 'dijit.Editor';
        protected $_elementType = 'text';
        protected $_module = 'dijit.Editor';
    
        public function editor ($id, $value = null, array $params = array(), array $attribs = array())
        {
            if (!array_key_exists('id', $attribs)) {
                $attribs['id']    = $id;
            }
    
            $attribs['id_hidden']    = $attribs ['id'];
            $attribs['id']           = '_editor_'.$attribs['id'];
            $attribs['name']         = $id;
            $attribs['type']         = $this->_elementType;
            $attribs['dojoType'] = 'dijit.Editor';
    
            $html = '_htmlAttribs($attribs) . ' >'
                  . $value
                  . "\n";
    
            return $html;
        }


The crappy problem it's the onsubmit:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     $form->setAttrib ('onsubmit', "document.getElementById('{$id}').value = dijit.byId('_editor_{$id}').getValue(false);return true;");

I have one implemented but not yet checked in to core, and it works flawlessly. I cannot guarantee it will be available for the 1.6.0 release, however.

This is checked into trunk, and will be released with 1.7.0. Please test and provide feedback.
