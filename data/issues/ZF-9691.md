### Description

Zend\_Date::\_date() and Zend\_Date::\_time() are passing invalid locale to Zend\_Date::\_calcdetail(): $return = $this->\_calcdetail($calc, $time, self::TIMES, 'de'); // 'de' is used instead of $locale

This is no failure. The code works as intended.

Please give a reproducable example to see what your problem is!

This issue is still present.

Problem example:

$date = Zend\_Date::now('en\_US'); $date->addDate('1 month'); // If file "de.xml" is deleted - exception appears ("locale 'de' not found")

Can confirm this.

Example: Zend\_Date::now()->setTime('00:00:00', 'HH:mm:ss', 'pl\_PL');

If we give locale "pl\_PL" method setTime still uses "de" locale (by calling Zend/Date.php(3478): Zend\_Date->set('00:00:00', 'WW', 'de')). Additionally if file "de.xml" is missing an exception occurs.
