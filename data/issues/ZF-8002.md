### Description

hello,

I just wonder if there is any particular reason why cookies sent by server with value not url encoded are sent back from client url encoded? I could not find any information about encoding cookie values hence this question (rfc 2109, 2965).

regards

// Cookie.php public function \_\_toString() { return $this->name . '=' . urlencode($this->value) . ';'; }
