### Description

Hi,

with the wonderful Application Ressource Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Router I can easily create my routes from config. For Eyample:

 
    <pre class="literal">resources.router.routes.pathroute.type                                  = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.route                                 = "(.*)"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.defaults.1                            = "/"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.map.1                                 = "path"
    
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.chains.httpmethod.type                = "My_Route_HttpMethod"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.chains.httpmethod.methods[]           = "PROPFIND"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.chains.httpmethod.methods[]           = "OPTIONS"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.chains.httpmethod.defaults.module     = "webdav"
    resources.router.routes.pathroute.chains.httpmethod.defaults.controller = "server"

So far so good.

Now I need to configure the separator between the two routes in chain. In my previous bootstrap code I have done this:

 
    <pre class="literal">$oControllerFront = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $oPathRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex(...);
    $oHttpMethodRoute = new My_Route_HttpMethod(...);
    
    $sSeparator = ''; // empty separator for the http-method-route
    $oControllerFront ->getRouter()->addRoute('pathroute-httpmethod',$oPathRoute ->chain($oHttpMethodRoute ,$sSeparator));

But I can't set the chain-seperator by config. In my Opinion, this depends on the internal method in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite -> \_addChainRoutesFromConfig(...):

 
    <pre class="literal">if ($route instanceof Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Chain) {
        $chainRoute = clone $route;
        $chainRoute->chain($childRoute);
    } else {
        $chainRoute = $route->chain($childRoute);
    }

In Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract the method chain knows a opt. param for separator. this method should be also declared in the interface Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface.

I have seen this ZF-6296 request and I look forward to the refactoring of the Router, maybe this request could be solved when refactoring?
