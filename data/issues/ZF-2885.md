### Description

[CS-8703](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/trunk/documentation/manual/en?cs=8703) makes some problems for HTML documentation.

The first thing is absence of the navigation links at the top and the bottom of the documentation pages. Probably there are also some other differences in the updated documentation.

Changes are produced by switching DOCBOOK\_XSL from [http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/html/…](http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/html/chunk.xsl) to [http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/…](http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl)

htmlhelp-common has a xsl parameter which has to be changed.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    


Set it to "0" and navbars are visible again. But this has to be made on the source (homepage) and not in the ZF itself.

Fixed using offered htmlhelp-common.xsl update.
