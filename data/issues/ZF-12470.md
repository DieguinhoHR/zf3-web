### Description

The HTML Email part of the Zend Mail documentation currently 404s: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.mail.html-mails.html)

This page is linked to from the main Zend Mail table of contents ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.mail.html)). I've selected 1.12 as the affected version but I think this is a general problem.

Comments on the Zend\_Mail docs page suggest this has been an issue for a while.
