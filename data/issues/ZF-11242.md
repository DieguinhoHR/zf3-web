### Description

I have read here <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8731> - fixed with r22302 I do not understand. Does not work! I use a simple way: $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select); Zend\_Paginator::setCache($cache); My $select it Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect or Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbTableSelect But when i call $paginator->getCurrentItems(), the method getItemsByPage() twice made the call $this->\_getCacheId($pageNumber) (read and write cache), but the second time is called after calling $this->\_adapter->getItems(), which changes \_adapter, and key cache is formed from the adapter. Are you sure that now everything is working correctly?

I'm using framework version 1.11.4 Thank you for help or explanation
