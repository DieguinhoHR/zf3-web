> Im a beginner in Zend Framework World Good choice! :D

I presume you're calling the index.phtml directly. Instead, you should call the index.php file (which contains the setting up of your bootstrap).

Though it's hard to know where the problem is exactly, you can be certain this is no bug in ZF. I suggest you ask your question somewhere on a public forum, or on the mailinglists.

View scripts are not intended to be accessed directly via the browser; they are to be consumed by Zend\_View, at which time they run within an instance of Zend\_View and $this is populated. Follow the instructions in the quick start, and setup a virtual host pointing to the application's "public" directory, and then access <http://yourhostname/guestbook> - which will then display the correct output.
