### Description

I think it could be removed from Zend\_View\_Abstract without trouble.

It was added back in r10130 which was done 7/16/08. IT was a bunch of changes that Matthew did while working with Zend\_Dojo.

I've sent him an email asking him about it.

Thank you, Jon Whitcraft ;) I will be happy if this could help for some improvement.

Reassigning back to Jon - sorry, I should watch the change dates more closely ;).

This was an artifact from testing the Dojo integration. I've now removed it in trunk and the 1.9 release branch.
