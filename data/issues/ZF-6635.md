### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter) mentions pdo\_mssql with a link to <http://www.php.net/pdo-mssql>. The name of the extensions is however pdo\_dblib and the link is <http://www.php.net/pdo-dblib>.

Right.

Anyway, I noticed that in the documentation we tell users to "Specify this Adapter to the `factory()` method with the name 'Pdo\_Mssql'."

pdo\_mssql is also mentionned at several places in the adapter documentation, and the driver is named extension=php\_pdo\_mssql.dll in PHP.ini. Such a dilema...

The php driver name - which could be virtually anything - has got nothing to do with the adapter name in ZF...

For some reason I missed the report, and only read the first comment. The first comment irrelevant imho (see previous comment), the issue itself legit.

Reopening & reassigning...
