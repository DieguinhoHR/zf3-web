### Description

Hi

I found this error.

If you would define GphotoLocation into AlbumEntry, dump this fail "Application raised an exception class Zend\_Gdata\_App\_InvalidArgumentException with message 'Property \_\_ocation does not exist'".

You need change into file AlbumEntry, line 377.

"$this->\_location=$value"

for

"$this->\_gphotoLocation=$value"

greetings
