ZF-10716: Wrong helper paths in Zend Certification Study Guide

### Description

On page 153 the helper paths/prefixes shown in comments are somehow mixed up. This is a major problem for anyone learning for ZFCE.

When added like: $view->addHelperPath('path/to/some..', 'My\_View\_Helper'); $view->addHelperPath('other/path...', 'Your\_View\_Helper');

I think it should be: 1) Your\_View\_Helper / other/path... 2) My\_View\_Helper / path/to/some... 3) Zend\_View\_Helper / Zend/View/...

Unfortunately the Zend Certification study guide is not a matter that can really be remedied by Zend Framework, it would need to be rectified by Zend themselves, and cannot be done so by the contributors of Zend Framework as a community.

This matter should be brought to the attention of Zend directly.

Im closing this issue as it is not directly Zend Framework related, and is an issue for Zend themselves as they provide the certification study guide internally.
