ZF-8291: cascading operations
-----------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-11-11T12:18:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-30T11:38:07.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row during delete() method calls: 619 $t->\_cascadeDelete($this->getTableClass(), $pk); why don't you give back to the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row the possibility to \_cascadeDelete instead of call delete() on the Zend\_Db\_Table ? in this way the delete() method could be called on the rows making the cascade really recursive not only one level.

1183 //$rowsAffected += $this->delete($where); 1184 $select = $this->select()->where($where); 1185 $rows = $this->fetchAll($select); 1186 foreach($rows as $row) { 1187 $rowsAffected += $row->delete(); 1188 }

greetings Simone C.

Either not an issue or was fixed in the past. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::delete does currently execute cascading deletes against depended tables.
