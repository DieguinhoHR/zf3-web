ZF-9428: Empty MemCached throws on getFillingPercentage
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-15T07:41:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-17T11:23:44.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)

### Description

Due to the logic

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!$memSize || !$memUsed) {
                Zend_Cache::throwException('Can\'t get filling percentage');
            }


The following code will throw an error rather then return 0

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $memCache->clean(Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_ALL);
    echo $memCache->getFillingPercentage();

I can confirm this issue. In our Zend Framework application using Backend, when the cache is cold we get really nasty can't get filling percentage errors. This only occurs when the cache is completely empty, when something is added it starts running normally again.
