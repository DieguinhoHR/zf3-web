### Description

Hi, at the moment Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher throws a Zend\_Exception when calling dispatch() and the controllerfile doesn't exist. In Version 0.6 it used to throw Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception and I think it should keep doing that ;-)

Also I'd like to mention that the "lazy loading" of Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php makes no sense, as it is required at the top of the file. But that's not very important I guess :-)

Regards Michael

This behaviour makes sense -- we're not catching and re-throwing the exception thrown by Zend::loadClass() -- as this is not a dispatcher issue, but a class loading issue.

The extraneous includes at the top of the class have been removed as of revision 3004.

Inability to load an action controller class via Zend::loadClass() is not a dispatcher issue, but rather a problem with the userland class/file naming conventions.

One note, however: isDispatchable() has been modified to check and see if a class file is readable; dispatch() checks that a class isDispatchable() prior to calling loadClass(), and throws an exception if it that check fails. So, a fix is present, but was not targeted at this issue
