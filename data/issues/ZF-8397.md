### Description

Following code will throw 'Zend\_Gdata\_App\_HttpException' exception with message 'Expected response code 200, got 412 Mismatch: etags =' ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient('liz%40gmail.com', 'password', 'cp');
    $gdata = new Zend_Gdata($client);
    $gdata->setMajorProtocolVersion(2);
    
    $firstEntryLink = '<a href="http://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/liz%40gmail.com/base/1a137ef0bd1517a">http://google.com/m8/feeds/…</a>';
    $secondEntryLink = '<a href="http://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/liz%40gmail.com/base/9da88df0d0beac0">http://google.com/m8/feeds/…</a>';
    
    // Retrieve first entry
    $firstEntry = $gdata->getEntry($firstEntryLink);
    // Edit first entry and update
    $firstEntry->setContent($gdata->newContent('Test content'));
    $gdata->updateEntry($firstEntry);
    // attempt to retrieve another entry will throw the exception
    $secondEntry = $gdata->getEntry($secondEntryLink);


Google Api versions affected: 2,3 (version 1 does not support etags)

When $gdata->updateEntry() is called, 'If-Match' header with entry's current etag is set to the http client adapter. When $gdata->getEntry() is called afterwards http client's headers are reset with the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Make sure the HTTP client object is 'clean' before making a request
            // In addition to standard headers to reset via resetParameters(),
            // also reset the Slug header
            $this->_httpClient->resetParameters();
            $this->_httpClient->setHeaders('Slug', null);


Though, in fact it doesn't make the HTTP client clean and we should manually reset all headers we don't need:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Make sure the HTTP client object is 'clean' before making a request
            // In addition to standard headers to reset via resetParameters(),
            // also reset the Slug and If-Match headers
            $this->_httpClient->resetParameters();
            $this->_httpClient->setHeaders(array('Slug', 'If-Match'));

Alexander, Thanks for the patch, looks good.

One quick request though before I commit this: Would you be able to write a unit test to go along with this? (We require that any new code has 100% test coverage, or as close to that as possible.)

 

 

Posted by Alexander Steshenko (lcf) on 2009-12-03T03:37:12.000+0000

Trevor, you are welcome. Unit test is attached.

    ZF-8397: Make sure that any If-Match headers that are present are cleared after performing an HTTP request using Zend_Gdata_App.
    
    This fixes a bug which prevented getEntry() from working after calling updateEntry().
