### Description

Hi,

i tried to add a decorator to my Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha object by calling ->addDecorator(..). This ends in "Exception caught by form: Plugin by name ... was not found in the registry."

I think there's a bug in Line 204 in file Captcha.php.

 
          "default:
                return parent::addPrefixPath($prefix, $path, $type = null);"


As I replaced "$type = null" with "$type" it worked as expected. More Infos about this issue can be found on the german ZF forum: [http://zfforum.de/showthread.php/?p=25418â€¦](http://www.zfforum.de/showthread.php?p=25418#post25418)

Thanks Rossi
