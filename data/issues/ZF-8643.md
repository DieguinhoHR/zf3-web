According to manual Code25 is the validator for "Code25 Interleaved 2 of 5" and it MUST be even. See here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved\_2\_of\_5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleaved_2_of_5)

This is not a bug.

I know that but in this case we have perhaps to rename Code25 to Int25 and to create a new Code25 (<http://www.activebarcode.com/codes/code25.html>).

Unfortunatly all tests, I made with Zend\_Barcode, were always with even number of characters. I only saw it today.

You are referring to Code25 - Non Interleaved

Exactly, I propose to rename existing one to Code25i or Int25 and to create a new one for non-interleaved
