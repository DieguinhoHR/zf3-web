ZF-5942: Zend\_Form::addSubForm assumes order of element prefix path array
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Form::addSubForm() iterates over the internal \_elementPrefixPaths member in order to invoke Zend\_Form\_SubForm::addElementPrefixPath(). The latter takes three distinct arguments, which are produced by assigning the result of array\_values() to a list(). If the element prefix paths have been assigned in an order other than the assumed order, the values will be transposed when calling Zend\_Form\_SubForm::addElementPrefixPath()

Consider the following example, where a form is created and options are passed:

 
    $options['elementPrefixPath'] = array(
        array('type' => Zend_Form_Element::VALIDATE, 'prefix' => 'My_Validate', 'path' => APPLICATION_PATH . '/../lib/My/Validate')
    );
    $form = new MyFormThatHasASubForm($options);


In this scenario, the element prefix path array members are set in the order (type, prefix, path).

This is the relevant code from Zend\_Form::addSubForm:

 
    if (!empty($this->_elementPrefixPaths)) {
        foreach ($this->_elementPrefixPaths as $spec) {
            list($prefix, $path, $type) = array_values($spec);
            $form->addElementPrefixPath($prefix, $path, $type);
        }
    }


When this code executes, $prefix will have the value we assigned to 'type', $path will contain 'prefix' and $type will contain 'path'.

I'm not really sure what the right answer here is, but in general it looks like Zend\_Form should treat element prefix paths (in bulk) like Zend\_Form\_Element does.

Zend\_Form\_Element assumes that when assigning multiple prefix paths via Zend\_Form\_Element::addPrefixPaths($spec), that the $spec will be either an associative array with members 'type', 'path' and 'prefix', or an array of such associative arrays (possibly keyed on 'type'). In this case, the ordering of the array members is not really relevant, since they are looked up by key (type, path or prefix).

I imagine that Zend\_Form::addElementPrefixPaths(array $spec) may also need attention.
