### Description

Ok I'm not too sure what type of details you need so I will provide code snippets for you to look at:

multi-page form: $val isset from a foreach loop from the following query: $select = $fabrics->select()->setIntegrityCheck(false) ->from(array("f"=>"fabrics"), array("f.\*")) ->joinLeft(array("fft"=>"fabrics\_fabrictypes"), "f.id=fft.fabric\_id", array()) ->joinLeft(array("ft"=>"fabrictypes"), "ft.id=fft.fabrictype\_id", array("ft.name as type")) ->joinLeft(array('fpt'=>'fabrics\_producttypes'), 'f.id=fpt.fabric\_id', array('fpt.price')) ->where($where) ->order(array("ft.name desc", "f.name asc")); $val->price is set to the value of 52

1st method $text = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('pr\_'.$val->id); $text->setOptions(array('readOnly'=>true, 'label'=>'Price')); $text->setValue($val->price); $fabs->addElement($text, 'pr\_'.$val->id); the outputted form segment is: 2nd method $fabs->addElement('text', 'pr\_'.$val->id, array('label'=>'Price', 'readOnly'=>true, 'class'=>'transparent')); $this->getElement('pr\_'.$val->id)->setValue($val->price);

Price I have tried different values for the name using: $text->setOptions(array('value'=>$val->price));

I don't know what else to try.

Definitely not an issue with the variable not being set.:

$text = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('pr\_'.$val->id); $text->setOptions(array('readOnly'=>true, 'label'=>'Price')); print("

 
    <pre style="font-family:verdana;">val->price before:");
    print_r($val->price);
    print("

"); $text->setValue(number\_format($val->price, 2)); print("

 
    <pre style="font-family:verdana;">val->price after:");
    print_r($val->price);
    print("

"); $fabs->addElement($text, 'pr\_'.$val->id);

I have attached a screen shot from my browser to show that the variables are indeed set:

setValue() locally works exactly as intended -- I put in a value, it gets rendered in the corresponding tag. My suspicion is that $val->price is not holding the value you think it is.

I'm closing this issue as I'm unable to reproduce; please open this on one of the mailing lists before re-opening this ticket to see if you can get independent verification of the issue.

Okay, the simplest case possible:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('foo');
    $element->setValue('bar');
    echo $element->render(new Zend_View);


results in the following HTML:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Â 
    
    


setValue() is clearly working to expectations. You need to boil your code down to the exact point that it fails -- which means removing dependencies outside the realm of the component (such as database calls). If the problem goes away, then it's in one of your dependencies. If it remains, then paste that in so we can get independent verification.

As such, this bug remains closed, as I cannot reproduce it with the simplest use case: using setValue().

I've managed to reproduce this issue; screenshot-2 shows the rendering of a form with html input elements having attributes setValue and setErrors.  
 I can't post the code here at this time, but I've got a User object which has an array containing form instances and when the User is serialized to session storage User::\_\_sleep extracts the values, errors and metadata from the forms and stores that instead of serialized forms. User::\_\_wakeup is where the process is reversed: instantiate the forms and the populate them from the unserialized form data - I iterate over the form elements and call their setValue and setErrors methods. I'll try and post some code when I have the time.
