ZF-3408: Zend\_Config does not decrease $\_count when node is unset()
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-06-07T10:20:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:39:12.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

The count() method, defined by the Countable interface, uses $this->\_count, which is set in the constructor of Zend\_Config. The problem now is, when you unset a value (done via the magic method \_\_unset()), $this->\_count is not decreased by one. So when you count() the Zend\_Config object after you unset a node, you get the wrong number.
