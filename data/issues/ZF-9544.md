This issue is specific to the German docs, but it looks to me like it has been resolved, it just isn't marked as such.

Checking w/ ralphschindler on IRC to see if this can be resolved/closed.

Verified that this is still an issue on the site (See: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/zend.log.writers.html)) as well as in SVN. I've applied the attached patch locally and found it to be fine. It simply changes the word "Firebox" to "Firebug". This can be applied as-is.
