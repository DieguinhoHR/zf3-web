ZF-7336: Improve Zend\_Form\_Element::getAttribs
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-07-21T04:58:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:08.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Improve the way attributs are retrive. With the patch attributs are now retrive faster no need to get/filter the instances variable of the class.

The only thing is that whenever you setup an new attribut by just declaring it as an instance varibale you need to add the name in the variable $this->\_attribsName for exemple:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyElement extends Zend_Form_Element
    {
      protected $href = 'foo.html';
      
      public function init()
      {
        $this->_attribsName = 'href';
      }
    }


The method setAttribs($name, $value) is still working fine.

It is also probably better to patche element that adds some new attributs like: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Image. See the patch for more details.

First version need to be a little bit imrpove by changing each element instead of puting it all inside Zend\_Element\_Form::\_\_constructor
