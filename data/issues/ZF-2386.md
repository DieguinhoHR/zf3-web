### Description

Zend\_Cache's exception when an illegal id has been used should be better written. Instead of Zend\_Cache\_Exception: Invalid id or tag : must use only [a-zA-Z0-9\_]

it would be better to have the illegal id also be written: Zend\_Cache\_Exception: Invalid id or tag 'my/false\*\\TAG' : must use only [a-zA-Z0-9\_]

Otherwise it can be very painfull to search which of the 1000nd Cache id's is wrong. This would improve usability.
