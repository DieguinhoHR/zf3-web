### Description

Zend Framework Gdata group uses a non-support version of HTTP-Request-Type, see link [http://code.google.com/apis/apps/…](http://code.google.com/apis/apps/gdata_provisioning_api_v2.0_reference.html).

This makes the following does not work: "Retrieve All Email List Subscriptions for an Email Address"

Check the following: ZendGdata-1.9.2\\library\\Zend\\Gdata\\Gapps.php const APPS\_EMAIL\_LIST\_PATH = '/emailList/2.0'; const APPS\_EMAIL\_LIST\_RECIPIENT\_POSTFIX = '/recipient';

I was told that the old URL, while depreciated, should still work for now.

If you're having problems, can you let me know what the error you're getting is?
