### Description

I've just upgraded to ZF 1.9.0 and I have a problem running my unit tests. Currently my invoices are generated by an external script which uses htmldoc, and then I've incapsulated the generated pdf file into a Zend\_Pdf object with this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $temppdf =  // this is a string containig the pdf filename with full path 
    $pdf = Zend_Pdf::load($temppdf); 
    //unlink($temppdf); 
    return $pdf; 


Until ZF 1.9 everything works, now after the upgrade I receive this exception:

2) testCreatePdfInvoice(Model\_Default\_InvoiceTest) Zend\_Pdf\_Exception: Action dictionary must contain S entry /Users/fabionapoleoni/Downloads/ZendFramework-1.9.0/library/Zend/Pdf/Action.php:128 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Downloads/ZendFramework-1.9.0/library/Zend/Pdf/Target.php:47 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Downloads/ZendFramework-1.9.0/library/Zend/Pdf.php:530 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Downloads/ZendFramework-1.9.0/library/Zend/Pdf.php:353 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Downloads/ZendFramework-1.9.0/library/Zend/Pdf.php:292 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Documents/workspaces/php/ZenitSpot Trunk/application/modules/default/models/Invoice.php:42 /Users/fabionapoleoni/Documents/workspaces/php/ZenitSpot Trunk/test/Model/Default/InvoiceTest.php:62

I tried to comment the unlink instruction and open the pdf file with OS X Preview and with Acrobat reader, and the file is intact. I also isolated the failing row in another testcase in this way and (clearly) the test fails.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /** 
     * Load a pdf generated by htmldoc 
     */ 
    public function testLoadPdf() { 
            Zend_Pdf::load(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../Data/invoice.pdf'); 
    } 


I don't know if this is a htmldoc problem or Zend\_Pdf, but I can read pdf's built with htmldoc on every operating system/pdf reader.

I put on a webserver the generated pdf the url is [http://rapidshare.com/files/263230771/â€¦](http://rapidshare.com/files/263230771/invoice.pdf.html)
