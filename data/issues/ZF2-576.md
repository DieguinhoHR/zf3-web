### Description

Hi, I have a problem with the transfer options when using a custom filter or validator.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = array(
        'factories' => array(
            'myFilter' => function ($serviceLocator) {
                $instance = new MyFilter();
                // ... some init code
                return $instance;
            }
        )
    );
    
    $filterPlugin = new \Zend\Filter\FilterPluginManager(
        new \Zend\ServiceManager\Config($config)
    );
    
    $filterOptions = array(
        // some options
    );
    
    $filterPlugin->get('myFilter', $filterOptions);
    
    //I expect must be called myFilter->setOptions($filterOptions)


The fact that $filterOptions transferred only in invokable classes, but what about the rest?
