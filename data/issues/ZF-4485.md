ZF-4485: Zend\_Translate\_Adapter fails to use language from Zend\_Locale when $locale argument passed to constructor is null

### Description

It seems that there's a bug in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter. More specific in the constructor.

When instantiating a Zend\_Translate\_Adapter without giving $locale argument, value from Zend\_Registry::get('Zend\_Locale') should be used. Appararently it is used in addTranslation() (line 107) method, but then in setLocale() (line 108) the locale field is overwritten.

The bug is in line 108 and could be fixed by replacing: $this->setLocale($locale);

With: if(!is\_null($locale)) $this->setLocale($locale);

I'm passing Zend\_Registry::get('Zend\_Locale') to the constructor to work around the problem.

Why should a new feature for 1.7 work in 1.6 ??
