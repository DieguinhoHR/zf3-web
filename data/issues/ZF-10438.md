### Description

I pass my cache object to Zend\_Locale::setCache or Zend\_Currency and when I call Zend\_\*::clearCache() it clears complete cache - no matter who worte it. problem is that one server is used by few projects and they all lose cache.

Since these components use Zend\_Locale\_data::clearCache() (and for future components that will use) there should be used getCapabilities() to determine whether the cache returns tags. It should use tags rather than clearing it all - if cache is capable of tags - otherwise clear all.

Similar problem was in Zend\_Translate : <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10166> but translate deals with cache inside it's own class.
