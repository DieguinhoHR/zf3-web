### Description

Add a way to link php errors to a Zend\_Log object so that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = Zend_Log::factory(...);
    $log->registerErrorHandler();


would allow this to show up in the log:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    trigger_error("Hello Notice", E_USER_NOTICE);

Attached is a version of the functions requested.  
 Sorry, haven't written any unit tests or documentation for it yet.
