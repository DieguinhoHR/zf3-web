ZF-5151: Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Http:: receive() and not required file

### Description

With the current implementation of Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Http:: receive() in the case of a **not require file** there is **no way to know** if the move of the temporary file to its destination have succeed or not.

This can happen for example when there is no write access on the destination folder.

Here is a possible patch :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
    
    // Check for empty file
    if (empty($content['tmp_name'])) {
        if ($content['options']['ignoreNoFile']) {
            $this->_files[$file]['received'] = true;
            $this->_files[$file]['filtered'] = true;
        } else {
            $this->_files[$file]['received'] = false;
            return false;
        }
    } // Should never return false when it's tested by the upload validator
    elseif (! move_uploaded_file($content['tmp_name'], ($directory . $content['name']))) {
        $this->_files[$file]['received'] = false;
        return false;
    }

If there is no access to the temporary directory you will get an exception when you set the destination or the rename filter.

And if the file has succeeded can be detected with the isUploaded / isValid / isReceived / isFiltered methods.

With the last stable release 1.7.1 my files aren't saved and no exception is thrown when my save directory have no write access. I'm using

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_form->getElement('photo')->setDestination($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . 'medias/news/photos');

The problem still remains: if a file with ['ignoreNoFile'] == true is submitted and _move\_uploaded\_file_ fails it will be consider received anyway :(

Thomas I don't want to bother you ;-),

but in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::setDestination() in conjunction to is\_dir() you could had a check to see if the directory have write access

And what has this to do with receive and not required files ?

Provocant question: Why do you manually set a directory when you do not have write access to it ?

Usually this happen when you go on production and forgot to chmod the directory. But a better place for this check is setDestination()

Well with the current implementation if my file have the option 'ignoreNoFile' and even if I did submit one, if submit move\_uploaded\_file failed the file will be set at received

                    if ($content['options']['ignoreNoFile']) {
                        $this->_files[$file]['received'] = true;
                        $this->_files[$file]['filtered'] = true;
                        return true;
                    } else {
                        $this->_files[$file]['received'] = false;
                        return false;
                    }
                } 
    
                // Should never return false when it's tested by the upload validator
                if (! move_uploaded_file($content['tmp_name'], ($directory . $content['name']))) {
                    $this->_files[$file]['received'] = false;
                    return false;
                }
