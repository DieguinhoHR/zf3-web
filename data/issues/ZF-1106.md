### Description

I don't really know how this could have happened without nobody noticing, but... the file "Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php" does not have the lesser-than < sign before the ?php, making the class unusable.

Easy as hell to fix, but still... how could this happen in a released version...?

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
