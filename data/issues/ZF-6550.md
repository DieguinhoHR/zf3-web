ZF-6550: Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page - Regexps not support via Zend\_Config\_Ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-05-05T20:28:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:55.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The function Zend\_Cache\_Core\_Frontend\_Page->\_setRegexps requires the actual regular expression to be the key to an array of options for that expression. This works fine when you're just passing a PHP array (And possibly XML), however there is no way to define this sort of array key via a Zend\_Config\_Ini file, the following fails:

resources.pagecache.regexp."^/$".cache = true resources.pagecache.regexp."^/article/'".cache = true

I propose the function is modified to support having a regexp option (as an option for backwards compatibility) that contains the actual regular expression. An example of how this would look in an INI file would be:

resources.pagecache.regexps.0.regexp = "^/$" resources.pagecache.regexps.0.cache = true resources.pagecache.regexps.1.regexp = "^/article/'" resources.pagecache.regexps.1.cache = true

A patch file to allow for a new format of defining regular expressions under Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page when using Zend\_Config\_Ini.
