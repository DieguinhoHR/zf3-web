### Description

Method Zend\_Loader::loadFile doesn't check if file exists, just do an include or include\_once.

I explained the solution here: [http://kassner.com.br/2010/11/â€¦](http://kassner.com.br/2010/11/include-error-on-zend_loader/)

Doing a file\_exists() check adds a second stat call, which leads to degraded performance. We explicitly use include/include\_once as these will give you important debugging information while simultaneously being faster.
