### Description

Hi Guys,

Imported [](http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=8245)<http://rss1.smashingmagazine.com/feed/>] with Zend\_Feed\_Reader was giving my gzinflate "data error" warnings. Managed to trace it back to Zend\_Http\_Response::decodeGzip() not checking for additional headers in the gzipped data it was being passed.

The PEAR HTTP\_Request package encountered a [similar bug in 2006 and the fixes applied then seem to still be in use in [HTTP\_Request2\_Response::decodeGzip()](http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/HTTP_Request2/trunk/Request2/Response.php?view=markup#l480)

This may be a duplicate of [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10575>] but no information was provided.
