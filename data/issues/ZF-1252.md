### Description

Sorry for my bad english:

At the moment i had to write a simple mailclient who communitate with an IMAP-Server. So i want to delete some messages. But in the method removeMessage (Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap) you can find:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     // TODO: real remove
            return false;
    //        $this->_protocol->delete($id);


so i searched for a way to delete messages. i found out that i can set the deleted flag an than call the imap-command "EXPUNGE". So i extended the class with this method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Excecutes EXPUNGE Command:
     * 
     * The EXPUNGE command permanently removes all messages that have the 
     * \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox.
     * (RFC 3501)
     *
     */
    public function expunge() {
        $this->_protocol->requestAndResponse('EXPUNGE',array(),true);
    }


does this help? or is it planed to complete the mail classes?

Sorry for the inconvenience. removeMessage() and noop() are now both implemented.
