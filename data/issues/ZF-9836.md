### Description

Categorized as bug since there are various serialization routines in ZF that would like to be able to introspect Row objects.

Because Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract cannot be iterated over in a foreach loop the serializer cannot make the column values available to Flash Builder and as such, Flash Builder cannot introspect the classes.

To fix the issue Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract needs to implement IteratorAggregate (Thanks Ralph) so the AMF serializer can work properly, along with the getIterator code:

 
    public function getIterator() 
    {
        return new ArrayIterator($this->_data);
    }
