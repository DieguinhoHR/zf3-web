### Description

The loading of data should be taken out of the constructor of the config classes and move to a seperate load method.

This would allow for just in time loading of data.

The load method should only be called for any the data access operations (only loading once).

It will mean a minor refactor with no change to the signatures of the methods so it should not effect any users.

Though in principle I agree that it would be optimal to only load configuration data on-demand, it is unlikely that applications will benefit to more than a negligible amount from this particular change. This is due in part to the nature of the data Zend\_Config presents to the application, but more so because of the cost of loading the configuration file relative to the rest of the application. This is likely to be a case of premature optimization.

In the interest of expediting resolution of this issue, I have marked it "not an issue" until it is demonstrated (hopefully with code) that a common and appropriate use case would benefit significantly from such a change.
