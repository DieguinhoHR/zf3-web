### Description

Even if we know that the return of \_\_toString is a string, it's not in one particular use-case :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo new Zend_Db_Select($db);


In that use case, the select object is empty of any value, resulting in echoing nothing, and \_\_toString() complains about that : Catchable fatal error: Method Zend\_Db\_Select::\_\_toString() must return a string value in xxxx

I suggest just to cast the return of \_\_toString() to string.
