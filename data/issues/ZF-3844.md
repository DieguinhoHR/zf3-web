### Description

File : Zend/Paginator.php Line : 344

There is an equal symbol missing :

if ($pageNumber == null) { $pageNumber = $this->getCurrentPageNumber(); }

Instead of :

if ($pageNumber === null) { $pageNumber = $this->getCurrentPageNumber(); }

This works perfectly fine and the is-identical comparison isn't mandatory according to the coding standards (seeing as there's nothing on this subject in there). Please correct me if I'm wrong. :)
