'e' which is equal to WEEKDAY\_DIGIT counts from 0 to 6 as mentioned in the manual.

I have not found a description where it was mentioned that it counts from 1 to 7 (which is only the case for WEEKDAY\_8601).

Mentioned issue not reproducable.

Fixed only a wrong constant (which also uses 0-6) but no description like mentioned from the reporter has been found.
