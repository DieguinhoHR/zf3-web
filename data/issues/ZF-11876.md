### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu does render Page \_properties as html attributes in htmlify() method. It allows only to use id, title, target, href and class like below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $attribs['href']   = $href;
    $attribs['target'] = $page->getTarget();
    
    $attribs = array(
        'id'     => $page->getId(),
        'title'  => $title,
        'class'  => $page->getClass()
    );


What if one wants to add "onclick" atribute for example. The only way now is to use JavaScript (perhaps it is a better solution in such case) but generally one should be able to add custom attributes. I think there should be an array\_merge with Page's $\_properties array?

{quote}I think there should be an array\_merge with Page's $\_properties array?{quote} Bad idea, because not all custom page properties are also allowed HTML attributes! Look at the first example in docs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $page = new Zend_Navigation_Page_Mvc();
    $page->foo = 'bar';
    $page->meaning = 42;
     
    echo $page->foo;
     
    if ($page->meaning != 42) {
        // action should be taken
    }

{quote}The only way now is to use JavaScript (perhaps it is a better solution in such case){quote} This is the best solution. We are in 2011 and inline event handlers are from the last millennium. :-) Use [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript)!

Frank: When I applied your patches and ran the Navigation tests I got one failure:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1) Zend_Navigation_PageTest::testToArrayMethod
    Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.

Hi Adam, I will check this and create a new patch.

Thanks for your work!

My result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Navigation_PageTest "/trunk/tests/Zend/Navigation/PageTest.php"
    
    OK (73 tests, 134 assertions)
    
    Process finished with exit code 0

Intriguing....Could you try applying your patches to a clean SVN trunk? When I do that, I only count 68 tests in Zend\_Navigation\_PageTest and I get the failure I included in my previous comment:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ phpunit34 Zend/Navigation/PageTest.php
    
    1) Zend_Navigation_PageTest::testToArrayMethod
    Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.
    
    
    FAILURES!
    Tests: 68, Assertions: 128, Failures: 1.

Sh\*t! I have forgotten one patch. Sorry, my mistake.

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2012-06-06T13:05:16.000+0000

Aha! That would do it. Everything passes now :)

Fixed in trunk (1.12.0): r24879

Thanks, Frank!
