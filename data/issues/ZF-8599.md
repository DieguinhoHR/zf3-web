ZF-8599: Session tests fail unless phpunit is run with --stderr
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Many Zend\_Session unit tests fail with with error like:

Zend\_Session\_Exception: Session must be started before any output has been sent to the browser; output started in /usr/local/zend/share/pear/PHPUnit/Util/Printer.php/173

unless option --stderr is given to phpunit. It should somehow be fixed or there should be some clear instruction in the docs, or tests - somehow this should be cleaned up.

I experience this as well when running a single test case that depends on Zend\_Auth, since it tries to use Zend\_Session as a storage method. It is fixed by using --stderr, but I also don't have the problem if I run all the tests in the test suite (omitting the --stderr option) as defined in phpunit.xml. Instead, the tests will pass with flying colors, but the granularity should be available in the test suite.

I'm experiencing this with 1.11.3 and 1.11.4 now. Please could you fix this.

This is documented to some degree at:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.session.advanced_usage.html#zend.session.advanced_usage.objects)

Though it should probably mention

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Session::$_unitTestEnabled = true


This issue should be marked resolved.

Using

```

doesn't solve the issue for me. I have to run my tests with --stderr all the time. Definitely not resolved.

I have the same issue - I can't run unit tests with

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Zend_Session::$_unitTestEnabled = true;


because I don't get a session id in that case, which I really need. I have to run my tests with --stderr
