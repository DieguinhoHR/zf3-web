### Description

Hello,

I found a problem when using Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Hostname.

Code below works as expected on ZF 1.7.7:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $hostnameRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname(
                ':locale.' . $this->_config->webhost ,
                array(
                    'module'    => 'default',
                    'controller' => 'index'
                )
            );
            
            $pathRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
                ':controller/:action/*',
                array(
                    'module' => 'default',
                    'controller' => 'index',
                    'action' => 'index'
                )
            );  


pointing browser to url: [http://pl.mydomain.s/index/splashed/â€¦](http://pl.mydomain.s/index/splashed/param1/value1/param2/value/param3/value3) received params:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [controller] => index [action] => splashed [param1] => value1 [param2] => value [param3] => value3 [module] => default [locale] => pl )


Everything works ok.

After switching to ZF 1.8.1 (tested on 1.8.2 - same result):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [controller] => index [action] => splashed [param1] => value1 [param2] => value [param3] => value3 [module] => default)


The 'locale' parameter is missing.

just tested on ZF 1.7.8, works as expected.

Broken since ZF 1.8.0.

hi!

ben, can you tell me, when this issue will be fixed? it's open for four weeks now and in 1.8.4 it's still not working. it is kinda silly when your router is useless. ;)

thanks holger

I'll investigate it when I find some time. I'm currently in a job-seeking phase and thus don't have much time to spend at the moment.

dear ben,

i surely don't want to hurry, but this issue is open for more than three month now, and as this is an important feature, i would really appreciate any reaction on your side. maybe there's another person who can fix it?!

thx & best holger

i find it very very poor that bug reporters are left alone with the zf!

meanwhile there are so many bugs in the framework which affect my work and projects that i developed some project with another framework/cms because i can't rely on the people here, though i contacted several developers here. i can't imagine that this bug is a minor one.

frustrated greetings holger

Holger, join the club.

If you look in the issue tracker, we have over 1000 open issues (of which around 50% are bug reports). We simply do not have the resources internally at Zend or in the community to close them all out in a timely fashion.

Issues with more votes and issues with attached patches (particularly those with unit tests) get precedence. Additionally, we have bug hunt days each month, and you can grab a developer during that time to see if they can look at your issue. If you want to see the issue expedited, those are your paths.

Bulk change of all issues last updated before 1st January 2010 as "Won't Fix".

Feel free to re-open and provide a patch if you want to fix this issue.
