### Description

The documentation for Zend\_Filter\_Input documents usage of a method getInvalid() but this method does not exist in the code.

Please either implement this method, or change the documentation. If it is intentional that this method does not exist, remove reference to it in the manual. If it is intended that this method exist, please implement code and tests for it.
