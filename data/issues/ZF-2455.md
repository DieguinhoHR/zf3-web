### Description

Variable $keyName is never used. Should be $key (or the other way around):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setParam($key, $value)
        {
            $keyName = (null !== ($alias = $this->getAlias($key))) ? $alias : $key;
    
            parent::setParam($key, $value);
            return $this;
        }

Additionally there seems to be no test that covers the case of aliasing a key and setting a parameter for it.

Fixed in trunk as well as in release branch. Good catch.
