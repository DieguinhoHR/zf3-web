ZF-4023: POST data persisting through different HTTP requests

### Description

I tried doing two consecutive HTTP calls with the same client object, and POST data persisted through the two requests.

$client = self::getHttpClient()->setUri('<http://my.service/>'); $client->setParameterPost('name1', 'value1'); $client->setEncType(Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_URLENCODED); $response = $client->request(Zend\_Http\_Client::POST);

$client = self::getHttpClient()->setUri('<http://my.other.service/>'); $client->setParameterPost('name2', 'value2'); $client->setEncType(Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_URLENCODED); $response = $client->request(Zend\_Http\_Client::POST);

//my.other.service also received 'name1'='value1'; from the first request

Adding $client->resetParameters(); between the two calls solved the issue, but the parameters should be automatically cleared after each request() call.

The solution is, as you noted, resetParameters(). This is by design, and would break that design to change it.
