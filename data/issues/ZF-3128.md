### Description

Hi,

First, this is my first post... If something is wrong in my issue tracker usage, let me know. Actually, Zend\_Feed can't read del.icio.us feed, because it uses RSS 1.0. So I improve Zend\_Feed\_Rss::\_\_wakeUp method as below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Check for RSS 1.0 feed
            if ($doc->getElementsByTagName('RDF')->item(0)) {
                $this->_element = $doc->getElementsByTagName('RDF')->item(0);
            } else {
                // Find the base channel element and create an alias to it.
                $this->_element = $doc->getElementsByTagName('channel')->item(0);
            }
    
            if (!$this->_element) {
                /** 
                 * @see Zend_Feed_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Feed/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Feed_Exception('No root  or  element found, cannot parse channel.');
            }


The changes are in the 'RDF' item check and in the Zend\_Feed\_Exception message. Hope this is useful and apologize for any errors.

(you should use the ``` style in the bug tracker, to make your code more readable, see [http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=texteffects) )

I guess the better way to correct this trouble is create a new class to read RSS 1.0/RDF feeds adequately, cause the changes I made generate some wrong behaviors. See below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // RSS 2.0
    var_dump($rss->description()); // returns a object
    
    // RSS 1.0
    var_dump($rss->description()); // returns null


So I'm creating a class Zend\_Feed\_Rss-based. How new classes can be submitted to ZF?

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

There is much more in Zend\_Feed to be changed to make the library compatible with RSS 1.0 (and RDF based) files.

Zend\_Feed not only consumes feeds, but creates them as well. I exposed a list of common issues to care of in ZF-405.

To not split discussions and lost valuable suggestions, I would flag this issue as duplicate of ZF-405. What do you think?

Closing as duplicate of ZF-405.
