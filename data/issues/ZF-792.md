From reviewing the code, it looks like this is a Zend\_View helper class designed to allow pulling in content from another controller action, and that it has some amount of caching included in the interface.

What I'm wondering is: why would you do this instead of using \_forward() in the action controller? Can you give me some details on what prompted this particular design, and use cases?

Thanks!

That's right - this is a Zend\_View helper. Some code for example

 
    <pre class="highlight">
          require_once 'Zend/Controller/Action.php';
           
          class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action
          {
          public function indexAction()
          {
          $View = new Zend_View();
          $View->addHelperPath('../application/helpers/', 'Avlab_View_Helper_');
          $View->addScriptPath('../application/views/');
           
          echo $View->render('indexView.php');
          }
           
          public function componentAction()
          {
          echo "It's work!!!";
          }
           
          public function noRouteAction()
          {
          $this->_redirect('/');
          }
          }


indexView.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    There are 3 component call:
    <?echo $this->loadComponent('index', 'component');?>
    <?echo $this->loadComponent('index', 'component');?>
    <?echo $this->loadComponent('index', 'component');?>


We don't need to controll call chain in controller by using \_forward(). In other way we should notify next controller2 about what controller3 it must forward to and then notify controller 3 what controller4 must forward to etc. It very hard.

In other way we should modify \_forward() to allow constructions like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_forward('controller', 'component1');
    $this->_forward('controller', 'component2');
    $this->_forward('controller', 'component3');
    // etc


it's means, that next action is 'component1' and after it will execute action component2 will start etc.

But it isn't right alternative. I can't say rightly why, because I have troubles in my english :) You may read symfony-book by this subject.

Please review the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action view helper in the incubator. This component will be available for the 1.1.0 release as part of the Zend\_View Enhanced proposal, and accomplishes what you've outlined.

Action view helper merged to core.
