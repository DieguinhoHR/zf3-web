ZF-9916: Is it a memory leak in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row?
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

This is the code I have:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $table = new Zend_Db_Table('user');
    $start = memory_get_usage();
    for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
      $row = $table->createRow();
      $row->name = 'Test ' . $i;
      $row->save();
      unset($row);
      echo (memory_get_usage() - $start) . "\n";
    }


This is what I see:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    90664
    93384
    96056
    98728
    101400


Isn't it a memory leak? When I have 500 objects to insert into DB in one script I'm getting memory overflow. Can anyone help?
