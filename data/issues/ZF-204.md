ZF-204: Properly supporting table aliases in Zend\_Db\_Select

### Description

In SQL queries tables are almost always joined to another. Sometimes they are aliased to improve readability or to allow subsequent joins of the same table or self-joins. Zend\_Db\_Select doesn't really support or understand table aliases, but this patch makes it right.

h2. Examples

Getting columns from a self-join:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    would result in:
    


This patch makes the result become:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    It also allows for an alias be specified with an array of [table => alias] form (result is same as previous):

This patch modifies some internals to make Zend\_Db\_Select a little bit smarter

Recategorize in Zend\_Db\_Select component.

Comment: we need to use an additional optional parameter to the from() clause for the correlation name. The string 'foo AS bar' is actually a legal SQL identifier if one uses delimited identifiers.

That is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT *
    FROM "foo AS bar"


is legal and has different meaning from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT *
    FROM foo AS bar

Ah, now I understand the patch. Never mind, using an associative array is fine with me.

Implemented in revision 3320.

Tables are now tracked by their correlation name, not their physical name. The correlation name must be unique in a query, but the table name can be duplicated, e.g. for self-joins.

Columns in the select-list are prepended by their correlation name.

You can specify correlation names by passing a one-element associative array in place of a string for the table name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( array('table1' => 'alias') );


If you pass a simple string for the table name, Zend\_Db\_Select generates a correlation name for you, and tries to make sure it is unique in this query, to support self-joins.

If you have a column that shouldn't be prepended by a correlation name, use '' as the name. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( '', 'count(*)');

I've just upgraded the framework to v0.8.0, and this concept is causing me issues. (I'm using PostgreSQL, and make a lot of use of it's schema facility)

I think the associative array (table => correlation) would be much more useful the other way round, ie (correlation => table), otherwise we cannot use Zend\_Db\_Expr() as a table name.

For example, previously I was using schema qualified tables and aliases in the following manner:

$adapter->select()->from("myschema.mytable t", array('t.mycol1','t.mycol2'))

Now to continue doing this and take advantage of the correlation feature, whilst avoiding my qualified table name from being quoted, i'd have to do:

->from(array(new Zend\_Db\_Expr("myschema.mytable") => 't'), array('mycol1', 'mycol2'))

Only, this wont work because PHP doesn't allow the object as the key.

Also, PostgreSQL supports table returning functions, so statements like: SELECT t.\* FROM myfunc('stuff') t; are not unusual in that database system. Which would require use of Zend\_Db\_Expr().

For further details see: [http://postgresql.org/docs/8.2/…](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/interactive/functions-srf.html) [http://postgresql.org/docs/8.2/…](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/interactive/xfunc-sql.html#AEN36424)

Now I know this is probably not portable anyway, portability between dbms' isn't my concern. Yet I still find select() very useful for building up dynamic queries, and this is making it less useful for me.

I'd like to suggest switching to ($correlationName => $tableName), but it's probably too late for this. (or is it?) So how about a two value array ($tableName, $correlationName) - this would allow use of Zend\_Db\_Expr() as a table name.

If we can agree on something, I can do the work and supply the patch.

Hi Mark, yes I think it's worthwhile to swap the order of the associative array. I regret that we released ZF 0.8 and this will cause some headache, but we're still in Preview Release after all.

It's even more important to make the alias first in the case of array("alias" => "column"), which I haven't implemented yet.

The issue of supporting schema names has come up, and also many people want to be able to specify "table.column" without using a Zend\_Db\_Expr. My proposal is that Zend\_Db\_Select parse any identifier as "[[schema.]table.]column]" and quote each one separately.

It would mean if anyone has an identifier in their database containing a dot, they would have to use Zend\_Db\_Expr to override the quoting behavior, but this should be an extremely rare case.

I'll probably implement both solutions above soon. I'll log separate JIRA issues for them so I can track them.

In the meantime, the workaround is that you have to write SQL queries yourself as strings, and then use $db->query() to run them.

This patch swaps the table and correlation names, and quotes qualified identifiers properly. It's fixed my problems anyway. Hope it may be of use.
