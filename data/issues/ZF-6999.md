Not sure how to update this so that it is included in the build process

It's certainly there in SVN, so I'm not sure what I can do here...

Stas -- this is a packaging issue. The Zend\_Amf standalone tarball/zipfile apparently does not contain Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader.

Alex, can you please ensure that it is included in the Zend\_Amf package with 1.8.4? Thanks!

I've updated the build scripts, and verified that this will be fixed in 1.10; you'll see the files in place starting in 1.10.0beta1.
