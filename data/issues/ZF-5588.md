### Description

This is a critical bug i've discovered a few days ago on a production site of mine. When i make a search with "\*" the zend\_search\_lucene system research cause php to time out and i've only a few record in the lucene index. And also any subsequent requests to the same site will go in time out. This is to resolve immediately.
