ZF-10268: Calling Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::\_doUpdate() without updated data unnecessarily calls \_refresh()

### Description

Problem (always repeatable): This problem is verified to happen in version 1.10.5-1.10.7. I haven't checked other versions.

Let's suppose we have a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset object with 100 Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row objects, of which some are updated and others (most) are not:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Zend_Db_Table($options);
    $rows = $table->fetchAll();
    $rows->current()->someData = 'changed';


Let's say in another part of the application these rows are saved. That part doesn't know (nor cares) whether these rows are updated.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($rows as $row) {
        $row->save();
    }


Now, the only changed row is updated, but all rows are read again from the database, thereby hurting performance.

Suggested solution: Make sure the database is only read after an update has taken place.

If someone wants to explicitly refresh the row, she can always use the refresh() function.

I tried to attach a patch, but I couldn't find some place to add attachments. Hereby the code:
