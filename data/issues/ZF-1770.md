### Description

When adding a second language to Zend\_Translate the first set language will stay set.

If you set several languages the best fitting language should be selected.

f.e.

Browser reports 'de' => 100&, 'fr' => 80%, 'en' => 50%

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale = new Zend_Translate('csv', 'myfile.csv', 'hu');
    $locale->addLanguage('myfile2.csv', 'en');
    $locale->addLanguage('myfile3.csv','fr');


actual the language will be set to 'hu' The user would have to manually set the language with setLocale() to fr...

after the change the language will be automatically set to the best fitting one, in our case 'fr'.

If the user sets manually a language with setLocale() any further addLanguage would result in no change on the language.

The best fitting locale could also be set if the "locale" is set to "auto".
