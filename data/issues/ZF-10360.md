### Description

I tend to get this issue tracker site by doing the following:

- visit a documentation page on framework.zend.com - look for a link to issue tracker 
  - by clicking on the Top Nav Bar > 'Community'
  - fail to spot it
- do a google search for 'zend framework issue tracker'
- click on the top result
- login

It was only when I did some research before writing this ticket that I noticed the link to the issue tracker in the footer of '<http://framework.zend.com/> pages' (and on the home page under 'Give Back')

I'd love to see a direct link to the Issue Tracker on the

'Top Nav > Community' Menu drop down of the main zend framework site.

The current website (2012/2013) includes a link "Participate" in the top menu. There you can find the "Contributor Guide" for ZF1 and ZF2 with links to issue trackers.
