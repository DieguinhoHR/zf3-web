{quote}23.7.3. Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Description

The Description decorator can be used to display a description set on a Zend\_Form, Zend\_Form\_Element, or Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup item; it pulls the description using the object's getDescription() method. Common use cases are for providing UI hints for your elements.

By default, if no description is present, no output is generated. If the description is present, then it is wrapped in an HTML p tag by default, though you may specify a tag by passing a tag option when creating the decorator, or calling setTag(). You may additionally specify a class for the tag using the class option or by calling setClass(); by default, the class 'hint' is used.

The description is escaped using the view object's escaping mechanisms by default. You can disable this by passing a FALSE value to the decorator's 'escape' option or setEscape() method.{quote}

It makes no sense not to have it supported for the datepicker element...

I provided a test-case where the description decorator works perfectly in r18047.
