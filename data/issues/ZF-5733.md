### Description

A setLifeTime() method would be very-very handful to change the lifetime without initialize a new cache object. At the moment we must have as much cache object as much lifetime we want use instead of using one cache object.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(!$cache->start('mypage')) {
            echo 'This is cached with init lifetime ('.time().') ';
            $cache->end(); 
    }
    
    $cache->setLifeTime( 3 );
    
    if(!$cache->start('mypage2')) {
            echo 'This is cached with 3 seconds lifetime ('.time().') ';
            $cache->end();
    }

please have a look at the API :

[http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Cache/Zend_Cache_Core.html#setLifetime)

you can specify an alternative lifetime in the save method or you can use the setLifetime() method which... already exists ! :-)

sorry, I read too fast your issue

I didn't see you talk about the Page frontend

in the current version, you can pass a specificLifetime for the end() method

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache->end(array(), 3600);
    
    array() is an optional array of tags
