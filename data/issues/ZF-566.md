### Description

Hi all,

I would like to make the follow URL: <http://example.com/news/876> -- hiding the action and the keys. I've read a issue tracker a way to do it. I followed as below:

index.php:
==========

$router = new Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter(); $router->addRoute( 'news', new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route( 'news/:id', array( 'controller' => 'news', 'action' => 'read', 'id' => null ) ) );

$controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $controller->setRouter( $router );

 Zend\_Controller\_Front::run( '../nuntii/controllers' );
=========================================================

It shows me only the content in IndexController.php and method indexAction(), as a default route and no params (controller=index, action=index)

I've tried many tips and suggestions posted here, but its like my project has only one route -- indexController and indexAction() ..

UPDATE: -------------------------------- Rewrite Base isn't set as default, then I just added $router->setRewriteBase( '/' ); , and now its working.

In the DOCs and mailiing list nobody mentioned it, and i couldn't make it works without 'setRewriteBase' in ZF 0.2.0

Regards, Leandro

Can you check the docs in the incubator from subversion and see if they answer the question better? They were updated pretty extensively this week, and one item updated in particular the setRewriteBase() issue was better documented.

In the current revisions, you can do something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $controller->setRewriteBase('/index.php');


and it will be pushed through to the request object, and thus the router.
