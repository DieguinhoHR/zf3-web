ZF-11851: No support for associated arrays
------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-10-27T15:23:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-10-27T15:23:39.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Client running as SOAP\_1\_1 does not accept associated arrays

$client = Zend\_Soap\_Client(.., array('soap\_version' => SOAP\_1\_1)); $client->someMethod(array('foo' => 'bar', 'bar' => 1));

Does not work because of the use of \_\_call(), the argument will be passed to \_\_soapCall as a numeric array containing the associated array as first element.

This a deviation from SoapClient general usage, so if not fixed, it should be documented.

$soapclient = $client->getSoapClient(); $soapclient->\_\_soapCall('someMethod', array('foo' => 'bar', 'bar' => 1));

works fine
