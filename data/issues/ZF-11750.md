### Description

I believe I have found a bug within your Zend Framework.

I am using ActionScript 3 , and sending an email using Zend\_mail. When I include the line '$mail->send();' an error occurs, saying Bad version call... This error means there is an error on the PHP side of things... WIthout that line, the function works, and calls my 'success' function in ActionScript.

Could you please provide more information, such as an error message and/or stack trace from the server side?
