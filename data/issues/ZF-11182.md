### Description

If I have content like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


`0`


Then the following assertion will fail.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assertQueryContentContains('#foo', '0');


The solution seems to be to change the code in DomQuery's \_matchContent method from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strstr($content, $match)) {
        return true;
    }


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strstr($content, $match) !== false) {
        return true;
    }

I've downgraded this to trivial priority as I realize that making such an assertion isn't very like to be useful, since the div content can be "100" and the assertion would pass.
