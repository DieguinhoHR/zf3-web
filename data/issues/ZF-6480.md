ZF-6480: Subforms cannot be attached to parent forms using a name that happens to also be a name of one of the subforms element

### Description

I have an address subform that has fields such as address ( and other stuff ). I am trying to attach it to a form under the subform name 'address' and it looks like when validatePartial normalizes the array notation it goes too far, trying to grab $\_POST['address']['address'] which is a string instead of $\_POST['address'] ( array ).

Here is a failing integration ( unit ) test.

$form = new Zend\_Form;

 
        $address = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
        $address->addElement( 'text', 'address' );
    
        $form->addSubForms( array( 'address' => $address ) );
    
        $val = array(  'address' => array( // subforms get passed as arrays
            'address' => '123 street',
            'address2' => NULL,
            'city' => NULL,
            'state' => NULL
        ));
        var_dump( $form->isValidPartial( $val ) );  //Invalid argument supplied for foreach()] severity [E_WARNING] in [F:\svn_sites\k12\library\ZendFramework\library\Zend\Form.php line 2021

Any updates or comments on this? If I decided to write a patch where would I submit it

Not going to fix.

We use array access and overloading within Zend\_Form, and use it to pull elements, display groups, and sub forms. As such, sub form names and element names must be unique even between the types.

I do believe you mis-read this.

I am not trying to add a sub form and an element with the same name to a form.

Rather I am trying to add an element to a sub-form, and then add that sub-form to another 3rd form with a name that happens to be one of the sub-forms elements. I typed up a use case for the "array access" you described that I understand does not work. Below that is 4 use cases reproducing the bug.

// I understand this is not supported $form = new Zend\_Form(); // create a form $form->addElement( 'text', 'address', array( 'required' => true ) ); // add an element named address $form->addSubForm( new Zend\_Form\_SubForm(), 'address' ); // add a sub form named address

// but here is the bug $formA = new Zend\_Form(); // create a form $formB = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm(); // create a sub form $formB->addElement( 'text', 'address', array( 'required' => true ) ); // add an element named address to the sub-form $formA->addSubForm( $formB, 'address' ); // add the sub form to the parent form with an element name of address

$val = array( 'address' => array( // subforms get passed as arrays 'address' => '' ) ); var\_dump( $formA->isValidPartial( $val ) ); // expect false, get true var\_dump( $formB->isValidPartial( $val['address'] ) ); // expect false, get true

$val = array( 'address' => array( // subforms get passed as arrays 'address' => '123 test' ) ); var\_dump( $formA->isValidPartial( $val ) ); // at least returns true but causes a PHP error Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in C:\\dev\\k12\\library\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Form.php on line 2036 var\_dump( $formB->isValidPartial( $val['address'] ) ); // same

Sorry for double post, your site keeps going down and I was trying to reload because I figured the 1st one didnt post. The real world use case for this is simple, I want to create an "address" form that contains an element address, or a sub form called person that happens to contain an element named person, etc.... I am not trying to add an element and sub form with the same name to the same form.

The bug is related to validation / value setting in the form, not related to getElement(). The issue is that the array notation "parser" violates the scope I expect, it sees $\_POST['address']['address'] which I expect to do the equiavelent of $form->getSubForm( 'address' )->getElement( 'address' ). Instead I'm pretty sure its trying to grab $\_POST['address']['address'] and set it to the sub form, so the sub form is getting a string instead of an array. I would expect the sub-form to only "see" $\_POST['address'], so it can access $\_POST['address']['city'], etc...

Changing ( commenting out? ) the following 3 lines in the dissolveArrayValue method would fix it.

if (isset($value[$arrayPath])) { $value = $value[$arrayPath]; }

The problem is the PARENT form "A" grabs the correct array when it does: $form->isValid($data[$key])

Then when the subform form 'B' ( added to form A with the subform name 'address' ) receives the resultant array it redundantly "dissolves" it
