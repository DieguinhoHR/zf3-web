ZF-7483: Change in Indian Rupee symbol in CLDR not incorporated in Zend Framework 1.9

### Description

The Indian currency displays as Rp, which is wrong, and not as Rs. which is the correct symbol. This issue was raised in Issue ZF-6795, where Thomas Weidner pointed out that the source was the Unicode CLDR database, where the symbol for the Indian Rupee was "Rp.". However, as the person who raised this issue originally pointed out, Unicode corrected the problem(Bug 2239) in their latest release, 1.7.1: [http://unicode.org/cldr/bugs/â€¦](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/bugs/locale-bugs/closed?expression=target.*1%5C.7%5C.1) However, Zend Framework 1.9.0 has been released with CLDR 1.7 which has the bug, and not with CLDR 1.7.1 where the bug has been fixed.

The result is that applications developed for the Indian market using the Zend Framework all have this bug, which is very irritating.

CLDR 1.7.1 was released at a date where we had internally already a code/feature freeze for 1.9.

It was impossible to integrate it therefor a new issue was added to integrate CLDR 1.7.1 for some of the next 1.9.x releases.

Changed from Bug to Improvement as this is not a ZF bug.

Thanks, Thomas. Can you let us know when the next 1.9x release will happen?

Thanks, Thomas. Do you think this will make it to 1.9.3? If yes, when do you think this will happen?
