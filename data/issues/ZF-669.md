Resolved in revision 2769.

setRawHeader() will allow specifying a raw HTTP header, such as a status code. However, status codes can also be specified by setHttpResponseCode(), which will use the code provided when sending the first header (third argument to PHP's header() function).

Also, setRedirect() was added, and expects an optional second argument of a status code to use (defaulting to 302).
