### Description

For the most part, I think the view helpers we have now are right on the money. They return standard form elements, etc, that are augmented by js added to the jQuery onLoad event.

Some of them, a specific would be the slider view helper, return jquery-specific markup that only becomes useful in a browser that is js enabled. I'd look for a solution that deferred the injection of markup needed for a javascript "widget" until it is known that javascript is enabled.

There should be enough information available at the time the slider view helper generates its markup for it to simply add the injection of placeholder divs to the javascript onLoad event.
