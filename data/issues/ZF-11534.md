### Description

Hello.

Zend framework is perfect, but it has some big performance issues. One of them is very slow AMF serialization - 100 000 small objects in array takes X seconds, but 100 000 objects with using other AMF framework with AMFEXT takes about 100ms ([http://teslacore.it/wiki/index.php/…](http://www.teslacore.it/wiki/index.php?title=AMFEXT))

It would be great if Zend had its own PHP C Extension, where could be some performance-difficult operations (like an AMF serialization/deserialization) - this extension would be optional and Zend Framework had to detect it and use it, if it's compiled in PHP.

Thank you.
