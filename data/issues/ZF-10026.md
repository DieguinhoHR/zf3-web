### Description

When trying to validate a timestamp with Zend\_Date::isDate(), always false is returned.

 <?php include('Z:\\Web\\library\\Zend\\Date.php'); $time = time(); var\_dump(Zend\_Date::isDate($time)); // returns false var\_dump(Zend\_Date::isDate($time, Zend\_Date::TIMESTAMP)); // returns false as well $date = new Zend\_Date($time); var\_dump($date); // returns Zend\_Date object with correct timestamp ?>
