### Description

When a class implement the method toJson, Zend\_Json::encode (using the builtin encoder) should call this method when encoding object in the structure.

Here is a code sample :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    set_include_path('/home/sylvain/src/ZendFramework/library');
    
    require_once('Zend/Loader.php');
    
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    class JsonEncodable {
            public function toJson() {
                    return '"Encodable object"';
            }
    }
    
    $struct = array(
            'encodable_object' => new JsonEncodable()
    );
    
    Zend_Json::$useBuiltinEncoderDecoder = true;
    echo Zend_Json::encode($struct);
    


This code should return :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    {"encodable_object":"Encodable object"}

Here is my implementation of the patch

Maybe it would be cleaner to add an interface (Zend\_Json\_Encodable) with the method toJson ?

This would only work for the internal encoder, therefore it should be implemented in such a way, that it doesnt hurt the compability with the json\_encode functionality.

The use of an interface Zend\_Json\_Encodable is a good choice in my opinion. But we should get in touch with the ext/json author to discuss, weather and how he plans to implement nested object serialization via an interface, so that we don't drift out if a to be come php interface uses some other method instead of toJson.

@Benjamin Eberlei : That's true, and I sent an email to the author of ext/json a couple of minutes ago asking him what was his plans about it

@Benjamin Eberlei : I didn't receive an answer from him... and I don't think I will ever receive one ! ;)

Instead of limiting my feature to the builtin encoder, maybe I could add it to the magic trick used by [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/en/zend.json.advanced.html#zend.json.advanced.expr)

This is a duplicate of ZF-9521.
