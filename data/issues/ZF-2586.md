### Description

It's a common practice to call dirname multiple times to require the TestHelper file from a parent directory.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))) . '/TestHelper.php';


The code above should be replaced with the following one

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../TestHelper.php';
