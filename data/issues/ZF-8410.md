ZF-8410: Zend\_Layout sets options twice on first call to startMvc

### Description

When startMvc is first call (no instance yet), first the instance is created, passing in the options. The constructor then calls setOptions. Immediately below startMvc calls setOptions as well. No true harm done, but extra work for nothing. An "else" should be inserted between first and second if to correct this.
