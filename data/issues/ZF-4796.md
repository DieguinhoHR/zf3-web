### Description

Assume i have the following mysql tables:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    create table product (
      product_id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
      product_no varchar(20) NOT NULL,
      primary key (product_id)
    )
    
    create table language (
      language_id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
      code char(2) NOT NULL,
      primary key (language_id)
    )
    
    create table product_description (
      product_id int(11) NOT NULL,
      language_id int(11) NOT NULL,
      description varchar(100) NOT NULL,
      primary key (product_id, language_id)
    )


now i want to query all products and their english description. If a product doesn't have an english description, it should be returned anyway. This is the desired query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    select p.*, pd.description 
      from product as p 
      left join product_description as pd 
      join language as l 
        on pd.language_id = l.language_id and l.code = 'en' 
        on p.product_id = pd.product_id


at the moment there's only the following workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select();
    $select ->from(array('p' => 'product'));
    $select->joinLeft(array('pd' => 'product_description'), '', 'description');
    $select->join(array('l' => 'language'), 'pd.language_id = l.language_id and code = \'en\' ON p.product_id = pd.product_id', 'description');


i think there should be better way to do that, because adding the ON-clause in the join of another table isn't that clean.
