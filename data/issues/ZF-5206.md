### Description

Nowhere in the docs is described, how to get the current route name used forthe controller-action request. It is not in the "Reference Guide" nor in the API Doc, but in the API Doc should every method listet. Please add the method getCurrentRouteName() to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface and to all classes which extends this class.

getCurrentRouteName() is a method of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite -- which is the appropriate class for it to be in. Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface defines routes that are attached to the rewrite router, and getCurrentRouteName() is used to retrieve the name of the current route that the rewrite router matched.

The method is not part of the router interface as we do not envision that every router would necessarily allow attaching multiple route objects.

Hmm... The Framework uses internally Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite ? Shouldn't this method not be mentioned then somewhere in the Reference Guide? I have searched such a function for about an hour to find out that the instance of Zend\_Controller\_Front => getRouter() has this information and I think a lot of other developer would also need this quite often.

Re-opening; should document the getCurrentRoute() and getCurrentRouteName() methods.
