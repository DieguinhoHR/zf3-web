### Description

For the section on the main doc about 'Posting entries to Google servers' and also the individual service sections on the topic, would it make sense to instead point users to how to accomplish this by using Zend\_Feed\_EntryAtom class, until more convenient methods can be developed?

This issue is not relevant anymore, because the method for posting entries has been redesigned.
