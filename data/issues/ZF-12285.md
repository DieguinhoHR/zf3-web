### Description

The following piece of code get me the wrong year piece in the timestamp to date conversion result;

$date = new Zend\_Date(1356974896, Zend\_Date::TIMESTAMP); $str = $date->get("MM-dd-YYY");

I get '12-31-2013' instead of '12-31-2012' as expected. Other timestamps that fall into 2012 work ok though...maybe something due to the last day of the year ?

This same piece of code was working and returning correct dates for a long time, I just got this reported to me for specific entries, the common denominator as I was saying is that they are all of 12-31-2012.

Hope this input helps.

Regards, Gonzalo.

This is now fixed as of r24880 on trunk, and will release with 1.12.0.

Basically, it's an issue with the "o" format identifier; first and last week of the year cause issues, and are often reported with the previous and next year, respectively. (See <http://php.net/date> and look for the "o" format in there for details.)
