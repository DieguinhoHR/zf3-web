### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table->insert() is not compatible with one of the latest changes in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, and causes this exception to be thrown when called:

"You must not specify a sequence to lastInsertId() in this adapter"

line 241 from

return $this->\_db->lastInsertId($this->\_name, $this->\_primary);

to

return $this->\_db->lastInsertId();

seem to solve the problem, but I am not sure if this is the right fix.

I think the right fix is that Zend\_Db\_Table::insert() should not return the last insert id.

The current design has two false assumptions:

- That every table uses an auto-generated id. This does not support tables with natural keys (that is, a primary key that does not use auto-generated values). For example, if we insert to table A which has a natural key, the last insert id is undefined. If we earlier had done an insert to table B which does have an auto-generated key, then last insert id will return the value generated for table B, which of course would not be appropriate to use as the return value for insert() on table A. This will cause severe referential integrity problems if the value is used subsequently by further inserts of rows that are supposed to reference the new row in A.
- That the last generated value for the table can be queried given the tablename and primary key column name(s). In fact, in all RDBMS's, lastInsertId() returns either the most recently generated value during the current client process, or else the most recently generated value for a specified Sequence object. No RDBMS supports a reliable way to query the most recently generated value for a specific table.

I have applied this change in revision 3313.

This is probably going to be controversial because it breaks backward compatibility for Zend\_Db\_Table::insert().

I have also removed the exception from adapters in some cases. Db2, Pdo\_Abstract, and Pdo\_Mssql ignore the argument to lastInsertId(). Oracle, Pdo\_Oci, and Pdo\_Pgsql throw an exception if they _don't_ get an argument specifying a Sequence object in the database.
