ZF-10427: Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_Simple must print extra info event

### Description

I wrote a unit test that is showing that the default format of the formatter does not include the info log event. The log resource does not configure the formatter writer currently.

In the error controller, the message to log is only 'Application error', and the stack trace is the extra information. The default behavior does not log the message and the stack trace of the exception. But it is the most important information to report!

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Actual
    const DEFAULT_FORMAT = '%timestamp% %priorityName% (%priority%): %message%';
    
    // Expected
    const DEFAULT_FORMAT = '%timestamp% %priorityName% (%priority%): %message% -- %info%';


Maybe a newline instead of the separator '--'. We should let the possibility to filter the text of message.
