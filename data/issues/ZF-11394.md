### Description

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase class has a bad doc block in getRequest and getResponse.

The doc block reports the return to be a Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract/Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract, when writing tests with this it means the autocomplete does not pickup in specific functions available in the Zend\_Controller\_Request\_HttpTestCase/Zend\_Controller\_Response\_HttpTestCase classes, making auto-complete less efficient.

Since the method always returns a Zend\_Controller\_Request\_HttpTestCase i recommend altering the docblock.

I have written a patch for this. I have a CLA but i need to setup my svn env for contributing, this is easier right now.
