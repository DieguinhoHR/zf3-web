ZF-7314: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached class named incorrectly
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-07-20T00:18:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-20T04:37:47.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The current Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached is using the _Memcache_ API from <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php> while the name suggests that it uses the \*Memcache\*\*\_d\_\* API from <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php>

I think there should be two memcached backends: - one named Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcache using the Memcache API - one named Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached using the Memcached API -- would be nice if this one also supports multiGets/sets and the other cool features of memcached
