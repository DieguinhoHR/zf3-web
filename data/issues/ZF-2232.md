ZF-2232: is\_readable keeps Zend\_Config\_Ini from allowing files in include path

### Description

r6910 added a check that uses is\_readable to ensure config file is readable. Unfortunately, is\_readable doesn't check if the file is in the include path. Until that was added, you could do something like: {$applicationConfigs = new Zend\_Config\_Ini('Ezd.ini', Zend\_Registry::get('appEnv'));} as long as EZD.ini was in the include path. I used this "feature" in a lot of my applications, and it was quite handy.

It seems I selected ALL versions, but it only affects everything from r6910 on.

Thanks for letting me know.

Sorry I broke it.

I didn't realise that parse\_ini\_file worked over the include path, so I've reverted my fix for ZF-2207

Updating Fix Version to follow issue tracker conventions.
