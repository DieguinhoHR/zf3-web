ZF-1720: Zend\_Session setId doesn't work right from PHP CLI
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If you try to use Zend\_Session setId to restablish a session inside of a PHP CLI script, you get hit by one or two errors:

_The session has already been started. The session id must be set first._

Also if your script happens to output anything to the screen:

_You must call Zend\_Session::setId() before any output has been sent to the browser; output started in_

(This shouldn't matter because you're using a CLI so headers has no bearing on anything. There should be a way to override this check)

The code I am using is as simple as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Session::setId($input['TOKEN']);
    Zend_Session::start();


It makes no difference if I call Zend\_Session::destroy() prior to this. The code above works fine from CLI using Zend\_XMLRpc, but it won't work if I call the functions directly from my own CLI script.

Although I don't know all the ramifications, etc., but one easy solution I might suggest is to add an IF statement around the first two checks, like this:

if (php\_sapi\_name() != 'cli') { if (defined('SID')) { throw new Zend\_Session\_Exception('The session has already been started. The session id must be set first.'); }

 
        if (headers_sent($filename, $linenum)) {
            throw new Zend_Session_Exception("You must call ".__CLASS__.'::'.__FUNCTION__.
                "() before any output has been sent to the browser; output started in {$filename}/{$linenum}");
        }


}

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Zend\_Session (currently) is not supported in the CLI environment. This is in part due to the fact that php's ext/session is unpredictable in the CLI env.

Scheduling for 2.0 to evaluate.

Updating project management info.

Unsupported use case, if you think this should be a supported use case, please add comments here:
