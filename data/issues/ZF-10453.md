### Description

In the constructor for the BigInteger it is doing thus:

$this->\_value = $this->\_integer->init($this->\_value);

I'm not sure what exactly this is trying to accomplish but I suspect it is supposed to be:

$this->\_value = $this->\_integer->init($value);

That would make more sense...
