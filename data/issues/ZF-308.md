### Description

Hello \*,

I have tried out the Zend Framework, in special the Feed functions.

require\_once 'Zend/Feed.php'; $rssdata = Zend\_Feed::import('<http://www.computerpartner.de/rss/news.xml>'); foreach ( $rssdata as $item ) { print "Title: ".$item->title()."\\n"; }

What you see the umlaute are crappy. Exp for an "ü" you see "Ã¼". and so on. I don't know where to dix it - maybe someone find the bug. ;-)

Cheers

This has to do with the framework not handling UTF-8 but mainly ASCII, it seems, this could be solved with use of one of the html\* functions I think.

There has been a discussion about the framework and UTF-8 in the framework triggered by the UTF-8 proposal. Read the relevant thread about <a href="">www.nabble.com/Zend\_UTF8--t2034057.html</a>" rel="nofollow">Zend\_UTF8 Proposal Discussion for more info.

Just change your page encoding from ISO8859-1 to UTF8 and you will get all displayed properly.

This is the way my Zend\_Locale displayes even Arabic or Indian characters without errors. The Zend\_UTF8 class will only change the internal handling, but generated output should work properly as long as you will only output the string.

Greetings Thomas

A good way is to convert the output from the DOM tree into Unicode Entities.

Copy and past this function into your Zend/Feed/Element.php file inside the class:

function utf8ToUnicodeEntities ($source) { // array used to figure what number to decrement from character order value // according to number of characters used to map unicode to ascii by utf-8 $decrement[4] = 240; $decrement[3] = 224; $decrement[2] = 192; $decrement[1] = 0;

 
        // the number of bits to shift each charNum by
        $shift[1][0] = 0;
        $shift[2][0] = 6;
        $shift[2][1] = 0;
        $shift[3][0] = 12;
        $shift[3][1] = 6;
        $shift[3][2] = 0;
        $shift[4][0] = 18;
        $shift[4][1] = 12;
        $shift[4][2] = 6;
        $shift[4][3] = 0;
    
        $pos = 0;
        $len = strlen ($source);
        $encodedString = '';
        while ($pos < $len) {
            $asciiPos = ord (substr ($source, $pos, 1));
            if (($asciiPos >= 240) && ($asciiPos <= 255)) {
                // 4 chars representing one unicode character
                $thisLetter = substr ($source, $pos, 4);
                $pos += 4;
            }
            else if (($asciiPos >= 224) && ($asciiPos <= 239)) {
                // 3 chars representing one unicode character
                $thisLetter = substr ($source, $pos, 3);
                $pos += 3;
            }
            else if (($asciiPos >= 192) && ($asciiPos <= 223)) {
                // 2 chars representing one unicode character
                $thisLetter = substr ($source, $pos, 2);
                $pos += 2;
            }
            else {
                // 1 char (lower ascii)
                $thisLetter = substr ($source, $pos, 1);
                $pos += 1;
            }
    
            $thisLen = strlen ($thisLetter);
            if ($thisLen > 1) {
                // process the string representing the letter to a unicode entity
                $thisPos = 0;
                $decimalCode = 0;
                while ($thisPos < $thisLen) {
                    $thisCharOrd = ord (substr ($thisLetter, $thisPos, 1));
                    if ($thisPos == 0) {
                        $charNum = intval ($thisCharOrd - $decrement[$thisLen]);
                        $decimalCode += ($charNum << $shift[$thisLen][$thisPos]);
                    }
                    else {
                        $charNum = intval ($thisCharOrd - 128);
                        $decimalCode += ($charNum << $shift[$thisLen][$thisPos]);
                    }
    
                    $thisPos++;
                }
    
                if ($thisLen == 1)
                    $encodedLetter = "&#". str_pad($decimalCode, 3, "0", STR_PAD_LEFT) . ';';
                else
                    $encodedLetter = "&#". str_pad($decimalCode, 5, "0", STR_PAD_LEFT) . ';';
    
                $encodedString .= $encodedLetter;
            }
            else {
                $encodedString .= $thisLetter;
            }
        }
        return $encodedString;
    }


Then change the line in "public function \_\_call($var, $unused)" that says "return $nodes[0]->nodeValue;" to:

return self::utf8ToUnicodeEntities($nodes[0]->nodeValue);

This worked well for me.

Closing the ticket because we get confirmation it no longer exists or it has already been fixed before.
