ZF-2385: Calendar demo doesn't implement paging
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-01-04T21:12:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:18.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If a user calls outputCalendar, outputCalendarMagicCookie, outputCalendarByDateRange, or outputCalendarByFullTextQuery using an account that has lots of events in the default calendar, only the first page of results will be displayed.

Paging should be added (either explicitly or using retrieveAllEntriesForFeed()) in order to make sure all events are displayed.
