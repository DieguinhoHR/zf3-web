### Description

I am indexing spanish text with Z\_S\_L, my documents consist of PDF and pure text files. To get PDF content indexed, I first extract it to text format with xpdf. Before indexing any text, my application removes most spanish characters, such as accents (for example, 'á' is replaced with 'a') and 'ñ'.

The problem is that I keep getting unrelated documents as search results. I, for example, search for "contratar" and most of documents retrieved have such word, but some of them (PDFs and simple text documents) don't have it. Instead, one of them has words such as "CONvergencia", "CONstantino", "CONTReras" (twice), "falCON".

Is this a correct behavior? I don't find any info about Z\_S\_L using stemming technology, and without it, this behavior is not correct.

You can take a look at this site (the one I'm developing):

<a href="">www.enpleno.com.mx</a>" rel="nofollow">Revista En Pleno

You have to be logged to see the results. You can log in writing "SYSI6" in the "USUARIO" field and "1bb7700006" in the "PASSWORD" field and pressing the "ENTRAR" button.

Write "contratar" in the "BUSCAR" field and clic on "IR" button. Clic on the first document retrieved (you will get "_EnPleno 74 008_"), you'll find all what I've written about. You'll need a PDF reader to see the document.

I first thougt that it could be an xpdf problem with tags or something like that, but this problem is present even in simple text documents.
