Most work is done. There are a few minor placeholder concrete implementations to finish and test, and documentation to write. Should finish by end-of-month, November.

Partials, placeholders, and action view helpers are now in core; awaiting HeadTitle, HeadScript, HeadLink, HeadStyle, HeadMeta, and Doctype placeholder implementations.
