### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $service);
    $service = new Zend_Gdata_Gbase($client);
    $newEntry = $service->newItemEntry();
    $title = "Product";
    $newEntry->title = $service->newTitle(trim($title));
    $content = "Essential handbook for <b>Product</b> dealers.";
    $newEntry->content = $service->newContent($content);
    $newEntry->content->type = 'html';
    $itemType = "Products";
    $newEntry->itemType = $itemType;
    $newEntry->setAuthor($service->newAuthor('bill','bill@domain.com','<a href="http://domain.com">http://domain.com</a>'));
    $createdEntry = $service->insertGbaseItem($newEntry, false); 


Results in...

Fatal error: Call to a member function getDOM() on a non-object in /home/mike/workspace/officeguild/trunk/lib/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Gdata/App/FeedEntryParent.php on line 171

The problem has to do with the getDom() treating $author, $contributor, $category and $links as arrays, while the setter methods store them as single values.

Updating the setter methods reveals another error with Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Person. I am unsure how to fix this.

Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0. The classes remain, but will throw a Zend\_Exception when instantiated.
