### Description

When using Zend\_Rest client with a single parameter the server incorrectly responds with An unknown error occured. Please try again.

Reproducible code is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class ExampleService
        {
    
        /**
         * Say Hello
         *
         * @param string $who
         * @return string
         */
        function sayHello($who)
            {
            return "Hello $who, Good Day";
            }
        }
    
    $client = new Zend_Rest_Client('<a href="http://localhost/web/example">http://localhost/web/example</a>');
    $client->sayHello('Davey')->get();

This fixed isnt included as part of 1.6.0, AFAICS its only included in trunk

SVN r12048 will be more fit for this issue, I think. So , I change fix version from 1.6.2 to Next Mini Release.
