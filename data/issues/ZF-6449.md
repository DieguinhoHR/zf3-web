### Description

I load a PDF file (probably a broken PDF file, but still....), do some drawing in it, and then save it. The "save()" call produce a PHP Fatal error :

Fatal error: Call to a member function getType() on a non-object in /home/pengu/www/share/ZendFramework/1.7.8/library/Zend/Pdf/Page.php on line 440

line 440 : if ($this->\_pageDictionary->Contents->getType() != Zend\_Pdf\_Element::TYPE\_ARRAY) {

because $this->\_pageDictionary->Contents is null.

I attach the PDF file.

This patch creates a Zend\_Pdf\_Element\_Array() in $\_pageDictionary->Contents in case of $\_pageDictionary->Contents is null.

I've got the same problem. However, my pdf pages are empty...
