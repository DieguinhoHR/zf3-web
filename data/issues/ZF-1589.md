### Description

_Summary:_ When a user attempts to access a property which does not exist, the error text which is generated in Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Base contains an extra space.

_Steps to Reproduce:_ 1. Create a new Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventEntry. 2. Attempt to access a random property, such as 'foo' ($cal->foo = 'bar')

_Expected Results:_ The error message given in the exception should be 'Property_foo_does not exist'. (Spaces replaced with \*s for clarity.)

_Actual Results:_ The error message given in the exception is 'Propertpy\*foo\*\*does not exist'. (Spaces replaced with \*s for clarity.)

_Regression:_ Introduced in r4732, affects 1.0.0 RC1 and RC2.

_Notes:_ Patch sent to rboyd for review.
