### Description

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset does not take into account the elements belongs to value, which can lead to duplicate id's.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array(
        "view" => new Zend_View()
    ));
    $form->clearDecorators()
         ->addDecorator("FormElements");
        
    $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    $subForm->clearDecorators()
            ->addDecorator("FormElements")
            ->addDecorator("Fieldset");
        
    $subSubForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    $subSubForm->clearDecorators()
               ->addDecorator("FormElements")
               ->addDecorator("Fieldset");
    
    $subForm->addSubForm($subSubForm, "sf");
    $form->addSubForm($subForm, "sf");
                     
    die(htmlentities($form->render()));


In this example, I've created a form, attached a subform to it, and attached another subform to the previous subform. When attaching the subforms, I've used the same name. I've also removed all the non-related decorators to simply the result.

As you can see, the sub-subform has an incorrect (and XHTML invalid) id. The correct id would be fieldset-sf-sf.

I believe the fix would be to add code to the Fieldset decorator that combines the elements ID with the belongs to value from the element, much like the Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper decorator does (see line 168).
