Here is a Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db table definition file for MS SQL Server 2008. I have not tested it on earlier versions of SQL, but it may work for them as well.

The difference between this and the MySQL database definitions is that there is no UNIQUE constraint on the the 'handle' column, but that constraint is not necessary with a minimal change to the Zend\_Queue\_Db\_Adapter::deleteMessage() method. Namely, change:

 
    public function deleteMessage(Zend_Queue_Message $message)
    {
        $db    = $this->_messageTable->getAdapter();


- $where = $db->quoteInto('handle=?', $message->handle); + $where = array(); + $where[] = $db->quoteInto('message\_id=?', $message->message\_id); + $where[] = $db->quoteInto('handle=?', $message->handle);

 
        if ($this->_messageTable->delete($where)) {
            return true;
        }
    
        return false;
    }

Thanks for accepting my patch. However, with out the mentioned change to Zend\_Queue\_Db\_Adapter::deleteMessage(), the provided SQL file will not work with Zend\_Queue.
