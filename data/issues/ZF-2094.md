### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle::describeTable() method is terribly slow on my system. Single call to that method can take about 10-15 sec. to complete on Celeron 2.6GHz with 768 Mb RAM on Oracle 10g. This causes problems even when schema caching is enabled, especially during development, since caches should be cleaned after almost each actual schema change.

The problem with this method is that it uses rather complex query and do not give Oracle a chance to use its indexes or reuse already prepared statement.

I've found the solution that can improve performace of that method by several orders of magnitude:

UPPER() functions should be removed from WHERE clause (and letting Oracle use indexes, table and schema names are stored all uppercase in oracle anyway)
========================================================================================================================================================

Binded arguments should be used for variable substitution to let Oracle reuse prepared statements.
==================================================================================================

Here is the patch that implements above suggestions:

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

{quote}table and schema names are stored all uppercase in oracle anyway{quote}

In Oracle you can do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    create table "foo"  (
       "bar"  VARCHAR2(50)  not null,
       "baz"  VARCHAR2(50)  not null
    );


By requesting ALL\_TAB\_COLUMNS or ALL\_TABLES, you will obtain in lowercase:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    TABLE_NAME                     
    ------------------------------ 
    foo

SVN11667: use prepared statement instead of statement without modifications on case. Application to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
