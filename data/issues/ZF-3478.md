### Description

I installed the version 1.5.0 on a localhost on my computer and I've developed an application. All was working on a local computer. But when I putted the version on line, I had a php error message.

It seems that some server are case sensitive and in the 1.5.0 version some classes are called with "require\_once", like this: bq. require\_once 'Zend/mail/.../...'; instead of bq. require\_once 'Zend/Mail/.../...';

I only checked it in the Mail module. I don't know what about the other require\_once calls in the other modules...

Hope it's gona be helpfull ;)

Do you know which files you found 'require\_once 'Zend/mail/.../...';'? With a quick grep I couldn't find /mail/ anywhere, but in the docs. Also you should upgrade to the latest version.

I corrected the mistake with a grep to, but I haven't any record of the olds files... sorry. All the corrupted lines where in the Mail.php file and in the Mail folder. That's all I can tell you. Maybe I had an old version. I'll check in the new one. thx!
