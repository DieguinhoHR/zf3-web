### Description

I have a bare bones usage of a Zend\_Form instance but the view can't render it.

 <?php //form /\*\* \* Description of AddVideo \* \* @author Josh Team \*/ class Default\_Form\_AddVideoForm extends Zend\_Form { public function init() { } } // controller use Core\\VideoServer\\Service; /\*\* \* Description of VideosController \* \* @author Josh Team \*/ class VideosController extends Zend\_Rest\_Controller { public function indexAction() { $form = new Default\_Form\_AddVideoForm(); $this->view->assign('form', $form); } //view <?php echo $this->form; ?> Returns this exception:

Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception: Plugin by name 'FormElements' was not found in the registry; used paths: in .../library/Zend/Loader/PluginLoader.php on line 412

I even tried to require the Decorator inside the view - which works just fine: <?php require\_once('Zend/Form/Decorator/FormElements.php'); ?>

-- I am using php 5.3.2 / and here is my application.xml: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>   
application../application/Bootstrap.phpBootstrapCoreDoctrinelocalhostdbuserdbpassdbname1../application/modulesOn

 
    </integration>

I have this problem when i try to disable short\_open\_tags. I don't use any short tags in my application!
