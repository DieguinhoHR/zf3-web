### Description

I want to use ZendAmf for sending Arrays from a .swf to php. The arrays contain integers (which can be positive and negative). If the integer is negative, php receives a number which apparently is 4294967295 minus the negative value. AmfPhp had the same problem, thats why i wanted to switch to ZendAmf.

Can you supply an example of the array that you are sending.

I just tried it again with the array: [-10, 10, -1000, 1000]; Php receives: 4294967286,10,4294966296,1000 I think this just happens online, locally it works (i am not sure at the moment).

Hi,

I can confirm this issue. It happens to all integers, if php is running on a 64 bit system. (The sign bit was extended with the assumption that an int has 32 bits)

I attached a patch to fix this.

Regards Stefan

Hi, with the patch ist works correctly! As i am very new to this stuff, just to make sure that i understood how the patch was meant: I changed the line beginning with - to the line beginning with + It seems to be correct. Thank you very much! Patrick

Yes thats how a patch works. Have a look at the command line tools 'patch' and 'diff'. 'man patch' will give you more infos.

Cheers Stefan
