### Description

If a rest action is runned (restGet/restPost...), prepareRest will "ResetParamters" of the client before (RestClient.php:135). Maybe it's not an issue, but, I didn't find the good path to prepare the request message.

Since te ZendRest component was removed from ZF2 and not shipped with the stable release this issue has become irrelevant.
