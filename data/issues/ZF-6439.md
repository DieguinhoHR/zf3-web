### Description

There is no Option to set the Plugin Directory like in my Example.

Application/Resource/FrontController.php:

protected $\_pluginDir; [...] case 'plugindirectory': $\_pluginDir = $value; break;

 
                case 'plugins':
                    foreach ((array) $value as $key=>$pluginClass) {
                        require_once $_pluginDir.'/'.$key.'.php';
                        $plugin = new $pluginClass();
                        $front->registerPlugin($plugin);
                    }
                    break;


[...]

\*.ini resources.frontController.plugindirectory = APPLICATION\_PATH "/plugins" resources.frontController.plugins.Acl = "Plugin\_Acl"

Version 1.8b1

It would make more sense to add plugin loading capabilities to Zend\_Controller\_Front, and then have Zend\_Application proxy to that. This is a fairly large initiative, however, and needs to be postponed until somebody has time to take it on.

This issue needs a proposal.
