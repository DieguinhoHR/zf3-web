### Description

I'm not sure if there was a reason this wasn't implemented, but if there's not could we add the ArrayAccess interface to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract?

Actually perhaps this isn't required. I wanted it in order to get around a problem I was having, but I've thought of a much better solution now. Still, if there is a valid use for it it might not be a bad idea.

Assigning to [~bkarwin] to initiate issue review.

Hmm, it's tempting to agree that ArrayAccess implementation would be helpful, but I wonder if we can see some use cases and evidence of support for doing so from others? Put another way, perhaps people can tell us why they need it?

To be honest I don't need this in any code I'm currently working on any more. But I can certianly imagine situations where you might want to pull out one or more rows. And given that there isn't even a method to set the iterator pointer, the only way to interact with a Rowset object presently is via a loop, starting from the first row.

Hopefully others will post some specific use cases.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
