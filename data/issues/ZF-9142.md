ZF-9142: Zend\_Validate::is() no longer loads validator
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-11T03:54:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-02-19T12:12:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

<?php Zend\_Validate::is($email, 'EmailAddress'); ?> results in: Fatal error: require() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'EmailAddress.php'

The culprit is on line 200: if (!class\_exists($className)) {

It should be: if (!class\_exists($className, false)) {

otherwise \_\_autoload gets called

It worked in previous versions if Zend\_Validate was the only namespace available, but the new version tries to load the className without a namespace first.

Removed "It is not an issue if there is no \_\_autoload function declared or if spl\_autoload is used instead." as it is not true. I still get a fatal error even when spl\_autoload is used.

I can confirm this bug, occurring in ZF 1.10.0

This is unlogical. class\_exists will never throw an fatal error because of "require()". Please give a complete stacktrace for reproduction.

When your set autoloader does not load the file, then Zend\_Loader tries to load it.

Additionally wether Zend\_Loader nor Zend\_Validate are using the method require.

The question is what sort of code you integrated on your side which throws an "require()" error. ZF itself only uses require\_once. You can check this simply by searching for require within Zend\_Validate and Zend\_Loader

Thank you for the stacktrace.

There is one thing which did not happen before 1.10. Using "class\_exists()" should ONLY return a true or false.

Otherwise this would mean that class\_exists() does no longer wook which is itself an failure.

It seems that this is a problem of Zend\_Loader.

As I already discussed with Matthew Weier O'Phinney in ZF-9082: The documentation [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html)], section "Strip require\_once calls with find and sed" seems to be wrong (regarding ZF 10.0.0 and ZF 10.0.1). Because all occurrences of require\_once("Zend/Loader.php"); are also being commented out. And it seems that's at least one time too much.

Just wanted to let you know, this issue is NOT present in 1.9.7. We rolled back after upgrading using the zfcampus PEAR channel.

Also please have a look at the documentation of class\_exists in the PHP manual [[http://php.net/manual/de/…](http://www.php.net/manual/de/function.class-exists.php)]. As of PHP 5.0.0 it has a second parameter autoload wich defaults to true. If this second parameter isn't explicitly set to false, class\_exists will try to load the class, using whatever is defined to (auto)load classes.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2010-02-16T13:51:07.000+0000

Stripping require\_once is not the case for this issue.

Regarding the footprint of class\_exists: I knew this. The point is that it's intentionally to look if a autoloader is able to load the class. And only when the autoloader fails, THEN Zend\_Validate will use it's set namespace directories. This way was also available within 1.9.7 which you mentioned.

Disallowing the autoloader to search for the class means also that you must change your own code as you must set the namespace manually instead of letting the autoloader doing his work.

The fatal error was because I was using require in my autoloader. Thanks Johannes for pointing me to Matthew's comment in ZF-9082.

{quote} This way was also available within 1.9.7 which you mentioned. {quote}

Yes, the problem showed up previously if other namespaces were added to Zend\_Validate. But now the problem is worse as it shows up every time (unless the non-namespaced validator actually does exist).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    $autoloader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    $autoloader->setFallbackAutoloader(true);
    
    echo Zend_Validate::is('1', 'Int');


The solutions are:

Suppress warnings (which I'd consider to be a bad idea)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autoloader->suppressNotFoundWarnings(true);


Don't use Zend\_Validate::is() and instead use the validation classes directly

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validate = new Zend_Validate_Int();
    $validate->isValid('1');


Or specify the namespace explicitly

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Validate::is('1', 'Zend_Validate_Int'));


Kind of defeats the purpose of using Zend\_Validate::is() and is, according to you, exactly what you're trying to avoid by having class\_exists call the autoloader.

I don't really see a way around it though.
