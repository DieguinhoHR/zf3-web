### Description

Option to enable persistant connection should be introduced.

maybe its not so important for mysql, but for example one could be using postgresql with connection pooler.

i think that to make use of connction pooling , persistant connections need to be enabled for database adapter.

Its better to leave that option to users and just warn in docs to not use it when inapproperiate, than to block the ability to use that all all.

Fixed in r16920.

Luiz, I did not apply the ZendX patch, can you open a separate issue for adding this feature to firebird?
