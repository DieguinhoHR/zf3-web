ZF-8073: Zend\_Form\_Element can't remove attributes
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-10-14T14:15:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-20T15:27:39.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element->setAttrib() exists, but there is no way to complete remove an attribute. The use case here is adding 'disabled' and then only being able to set it to an empty string, which still means disabled, rather than removing the attribute all together.

Setting an attribute to null seems to remove it, but it might be nice to have a convenience method for this.

The attached patch adds a removeAttrib($name) method to Zend\_Form\_Element. It's just a convenience method that proxies to setAttrib($name, null), but might be a good addition.

Setting this issue as resolved as technically this is a non-issue. However, the api might be a bit nicer with the attached patch.
