### Description

in Zend\\Search\\Lucene\\Document\\Html.php the highlightExtended method calls the default analyzer's tokenize method without an encoding (second argument). this way it's impossible to pass the encoding information as far as I can see (without creating a custom analyzer and setting that as default).

the $params argument of the highLightExtended could be used to accept encoding and pass it to the tokenize method.
