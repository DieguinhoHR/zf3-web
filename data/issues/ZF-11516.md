Kim, I've cleaned up your patch a little (modified formatting and output messages to match existing code, removed some unnecessary lines) and added code to remove the layoutsDirectory entry from .zfproject.xml when zf disable layout is called.

I've attached the patch, and will commit it soon. Can you try it out for me first to make sure the changes I added are OK?

Adam,

I will try this later but it seems like the layout directory is deleted too. I think we don't want to do that. A good layout may end up to be deleted accidentally. There should be a separate action for this, for example zf remove layout.

Adam,

I have now tested your patch. I see that it only removes these lines from .zfproject.xml

 
    <pre class="highlight">


and leaves the /application/layouts directory untouched. It's good that it really does not remove that directory. However, the .zfproject.xml is now out of sync what's the real directory structure. I still think that disabling layout should only remove the layout resource from application/configs/application.ini and leave the project structure untouched - including .zfproject.xml.

I agree with Kim on this -- disabling is not the same as removing, and I'd worry that re-enabling later would try to overwrite files.

Speaking of which: what happens when you call "zf enable layout" after calling "zf disable layout"? I would expect in this case the following:

- "disable" would remove or comment out the application.ini entry
- "enable" after a disable would add or uncomment the application.ini entry, and check to see if a entry exists; if not, it creates it. It also checks to see if the layout.phtml file exists; if so, it does nothing, but if not, it creates it.

Valid point; I hadn't considered that .zfproject.xml would end up out of sync with the actual project directory structure.

In the patch I attached zf disable layout removes the layout config entry from application.ini and associated layout information from .zfproject.xml, but leaves the layout scripts intact.

When you call zf enable layout after calling zf disable layout it will add the resources.layout.layoutPath entry in [production] section. Unless run in pretend mode, zf enable layout always calls Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Layout::createResource, which updates the .zfproject.xml file with the structure Kim outlined in his comment on 30/Jun/2011 @ 2:26PM. If i'm reading the code correctly, then zf enable layout will always overwrite the existing layout script file, ( Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Layout::enable always calls $layoutScriptFile->create())

Should we consider changing that behaviour? ie: zf disable layout comments out layout lines in application.ini, zf enable layout enables commented-out lines (or creates new ones if they don't already exist) and doesn't overwrite an existing layout file

@Matthew Based on your comments I have rejigged the fix: \* Don't overwrite an existing layout file when calling zf enable layout after zf disable layout \* Don't remove layoutsDirectory tree from .zfproject.xml

Should we also implement a zf remove layout function as Kim mentioned above, ie: deletes all traces of zf enable layout having ever been run?

Fix committed to trunk in r24303

Adam - looks like you really fix it. I was struggling with the following use case, but you fix it ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    zf create project ZF-11516
    cd ZF-11516
    zf enable layout
    zf disable layout
    rm application/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml
    zf enable layout # should create layout.phtml


bq. Should we also implement a zf remove layout function as Kim mentioned above, ie: deletes all traces of zf enable layout having ever been run?

I think that it's not a good idea to delete all traces of zf enable layout. For example, one may have multiple layout files under application/layouts/scripts. Thus zf remove layout should take additional parameter to tell the tool which layout file will be removed etc. Because of this additional overhead, I wouldn't implement this function as we don't know do we really need this - or what do you think?

Thank you both for your feedback. I've merged the fix into release-1.11 in r24408

As for a zf remove layout, I'm fine with omitting it. I didn't see a solid use case for it, but if you did I would have implemented it anyway.
