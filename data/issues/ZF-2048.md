### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale1 = new Zend_Locale('zh_TW'); 
    $t1 = new Zend_Date();
    
    $c1 = $t1->addMinute(10);
    $c2 = $t1->subMinute(10);
    echo "1:".$t1->compare($t1, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";
    echo "2:".$t1->compare($c1, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";
    echo "3:".$t1->compare($c2, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";


Expect: 1:0 2:-1 3:1

Actually: 1:1 2:1 3:1

If set the locale to 'en\_US', it returns correctly.

You have to set the $t1 time to after 12:00 PM

Even for 'en\_US' or any other locale your code does not work.

You can not add 10 minutes to T1 then make a copy and compare it with the copy expecting that it has two different values. What I expect you to do is something like that:

<

pre class="highlight">    require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
    print "

 
    ";
    
    $locale1 = new Zend_Locale('zh_TW'); 
    $t1 = new Zend_Date();
    
    $c1 = clone($t1);
    $c2 = clone($t1);
    $c1->addMinute(10);
    $c2->subMinute(10);
    echo "1:".$t1->compare($t1, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";
    echo "2:".$t1->compare($c1, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";
    echo "3:".$t1->compare($c2, Zend_Date::TIMES, $locale1)."\n";


I see no problems within the class related to compare as your code does not work for any locale.

Closing ticket because of lacking response. Given testcode works as it should related to given coding.
