### Description

I am trying to make my existing website and user base into an OpenId provider. The code for Zend\_OpenId\_Provider->login() uses md5, however my existing user base does not support MD5. Shouldn't it be a setting or option to use md5, another encryption, or none?

Actually the issue is more complex than I thought.

The code is if (!$this->\_storage->checkUser($id, md5($id.$password)))

Why $id.$password?
