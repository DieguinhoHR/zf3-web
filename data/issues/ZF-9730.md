### Description

As of now when you run: zf.sh create action read Index mymodule It adds the readAction to the default module's IndexController.

You need to add the 1 to get the corresponding view script for the action created. If you leave it out, the module is not used:

zf.sh create action read Index 1 mymodule

Does this fix your issue?

I see in the help it says: zf create action name controller-name[=Index] view-include[=1] module Which I think this pretty clear. However, I always thought that it added the view script by default, as specified in the brackets [=1].

The problem I am/was having is that the action _code_ gets added to the _default_ module's index controller and not the _module's_ index controller that was specified on the command line.

Sorry to be so late with this reply.

I am gonna close as not an issue.

The [=1] is more or less telling you what the default would be if no parameters are supplied at all. It cannot tell what parameters you are skipping if you are skipping any. Think of it like a function call:

function foo($one = 1, $two = 2, $three = 3) {}

In that example, you could not simply skip $one and $two when calling foo and supply three.
