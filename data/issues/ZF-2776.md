ZF-2776: Update Documentation once per week
-------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Task  Created: 2008-03-01T10:56:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-10-10T13:54:41.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The documentation which can be found online on the homepage should be updated about once a week.

The problem is that when new components are integrated they normally are cored shortly before a release. The docu-team has not much time for translating the chapters. Also the update would mean that the online docu is always up to date.

It should be no problem to automate this task. It should also be possible to do this per language so if there is a parsing error on one language all other languages are build correct.

I would if I can... but I have no rights. ;-)

As I have no access to the homepage or the server or the build process I can only put up my hands which I've done.

The automatted task, which is already done for the completeness of the translations (/manual/status) exists. This one is only a cousine from it to have the translations up to date. This is also done at the PHP docu page itself.

Someone from Zend who has the right for it has to do this.

Sorry, Thomas, my mistake. I meant to assign this to someone at Zend. This should be covered by our continuous integration server, however.

Darby, this should be covered by the continuous integration server you're currently working on. Assigning to you so we can remember that the CI server should cover building docs in all languages, too. Do whatever you want with this issue- if we can track this without an issue, feel free to close it. Maybe we should close it and add a document task to our CI server task?

Resetting Fix Version/s field. This field should not be set until the issue has been added to a release during the release planning process.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.

This is covered by our continuous integration server, which will be back up and running shortly.
