### Description

I could not figure how to set the OAuth Realm for a Zend\_Oauth\_Client. The general problem is that all params would exist but are not implemented in the client.

The toHeader function in Zend\_Oauth\_Token\_Access looks as following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function toHeader(
            $url, Zend_Oauth_Config_ConfigInterface $config, array $customParams = null, $realm = null
        ) {


As can be seen, the fourth paraemter is $realm. But in Zend\_Oauth\_Client it is not used as can be seen below.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $oauthHeaderValue = $this->getToken()->toHeader(
                    $this->getUri(true),
                    $this->_config,
                    $this->_getSignableParametersAsQueryString(),
                );


It is necessary that the realm can be set for the client, otherwise the whole realm parameter does not make sense and calls to Yahoo OAuth are not possible. I extended the client as following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $oauthHeaderValue = $this->getToken()->toHeader(
                    $this->getUri(true),
                    $this->_config,
                    $this->_getSignableParametersAsQueryString(),
                    $this->_getRealm(),
    
                );


I added a getter and a setter for the realm. Like this it works.

I've attached a fix for this issue. It modifies Zend\_Oauth\_Config to add a 'realm' attribute, and modifies Zend\_Oauth\_Client:250 to add realm to the toHeader() call as outlined in reporter's post.

I haven't had much experience yet with using Zend\_Oauth, so i'm not entirely certain this is the best way to add the ability to configure the realm. Comments?

Looks good. That's exactly the way I implemented it and it works. I also think this is the right way to add it.

Thanks for the fix.
