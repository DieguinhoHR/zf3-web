### Description

DI Quickstart in [documentation](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/documentation/manual/en/tutorials/quickstart-di.xml) is out of sync from [wiki page](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Zend+DI+QuickStart). I'm not sure which should be the _main_, which should I update.

And there are some outdated examples in both (e.g. $di->getInstanceManager()->_setProperty_ - should be setParameters) which no longer work.

Added an advice about outdated content in the wiki article.
