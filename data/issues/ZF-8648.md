### Description

On the first page of the Quickstart guide ([http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-your-project)), there is a note box under "Create Your Project". In that box there is a line that says "If you have problems setting up the zf command-line tool, please refer to the manual." [the manual] is a link to [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.tool.framework.clitool#zend.tool.framework.clitool.setup-general) which does not exist, so it takes the user to the index of the reference guide.

This should be fixed right away, as it is the first step in getting started with the Zend Framework, and adequate documentation on this topic should be readily available.
