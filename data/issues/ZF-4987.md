ZF-4987: Refactoring: Add default page options to Zend\_Pdf
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It would be failry easy to add setter/getter for default page options to Zend\_Pdf that hold information about Default Font, Fontsize, Pagesize and Style.

These could automatically be applied to any new Zend\_Pdf\_Page object that is called using Zend\_Pdf::newPage() and would save some repetition in code.
