### Description

On page 181 ("Search Results" section) of the Zend Framework certification study guide is the following passage:

"The search result is an array of Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryHit objects. Each of these has two properties: $hit->document is a document number within the index..."

$hit->document should read $hit->id here.

I'm closing this since ZF Cert Study Guide issues aren't tracked here, but I've forwarded this report to the author for correction. Thanks! ,Wil
