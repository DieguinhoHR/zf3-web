ZF-1799: Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Base64 is saved to XML request in decoded form
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When XML request is created, base64'parameters are not rendered correctly. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar::saveXML() retrieves object's value via method getValue(), which returns decoded (base64\_decode) form of value.

I've run into this issue as well using the main trunk (rev 6613)...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * GetNames
     *
     * @return array
     */
    function GetNames()
    {
        $ret = array(
            array(
                'id'=>1, 
                'name'=>'Jack', 
                'created_dt'=>new Zend_XmlRpc_Value_DateTime(1191877812), 
                'encoded'=>new Zend_XmlRpc_Value_Base64('testing 1..2..3')
            )
        );
        return $ret;
    }
    $server->addFunction("GetNames");
    $response = $server->handle();


...The raw xml response from the server when calling this function is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    id1nameJackcreated_dt20071008T14:10:12encodedtesting 1..2..3

...which shows that the server is correctly wrapping the data values for the datetime and base64, but the base64 value is not encoded. The datetime value is correct.

The Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client is handling the response differently which confused me a little: (from $xmlrpcClient->getLastResponse())

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    id1nameJackcreated_dt20071008T14:10:12encodedÂµë­Šx5

...which shows: \* The datetime value is wrapped as a string. \* The base65 value has been decoded, and is wrapped as a string (the server had encoded the value "improperly" (?)).

Is the desired behavior of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client to support automatic conversion of these datatypes, or is it up to the user to convert?

Potential workaround is below, but is undesirable long term.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * GetNames
     *
     * @return array
     */
    function GetNames()
    {
        $ret = array(
            array(
                'id'=>1, 
                'name'=>'Jack', 
                'created_dt'=>new Zend_XmlRpc_Value_DateTime(1191877812),
                'encoded'=>base64_encode('testing 1..2..3')
            )
        );
        return $ret;
    }  


... and then on the client...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $retval = $client->call('GetNames');
    for ($i=0; $i

A test xmlrpc server and client that reproduces the issue(s).

I ran into the same problem with the release version 1.0.2. I sent an email to the mailing list about it ([http://nabble.com/Zend\_XmlRpc-and-base64-tf4609278…](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_XmlRpc-and-base64-tf4609278s16154.html)) because I hadn't seen this bug report yet.

In short, what I did to fix it : In : XmlRpc/Value/Scalar.php Change : line 50 From :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    Into :


Reason : The method call getValue() refers back to the Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Base64 class. That function returns the base64 decoded value of the object, which you don't want in this case.
