### Description

on 1.9.5, my calls to $request->getUserParams() return an array with 'action', 'controller', 'module' and all other extra data that was pushed to the request with $request->setParam(). on 1.10.0, any call to getUserParams() returns ALL params.

I simply cannot reproduce the issue. Once routing is complete, getUserParams() is returning all parameters matched/set during routing, as well as any others I push into the request object.

Can you provide some (minimal) code that reproduces the issue for you?

Matthew,

I am sorry but there was a mistake in my bug report. It is not that getUserParams returns an empty array, on the contrary - it returns with ALL params in the request object and not only the user params. That is - I get $\_GET and $\_PUT params as well in the array that getUserParams returns.

Maybe also important to note (since you mentioned routing) - this is happening in a REST app, after Zend\_Rest\_Route routing.

I tested it now with 1.9.5 and here is a var\_export of getUserParams: array ( 'module' => 'rest', 'controller' => 'auth', 'action' => 'index', 'format' => 'json', )

I switch to 1.10.0 and the var\_export is: array ( 'module' => 'rest', 'controller' => 'auth', 'action' => 'index', 'oauth\_consumer\_key' => '58affc12bf8fa63f0214a6af808b15de', 'oauth\_nonce' => 'e6d1710ace54fb5db6b7ccde2ab434aa', 'oauth\_signature\_method' => 'HMAC-SHA1', 'oauth\_timestamp' => '1265701227', 'oauth\_token' => 'bdca6efb043178ef172612dd1e173dde', 'oauth\_version' => '1.0', 'oauth\_signature' => 'BsmrI93dTGUQCr/OGsudyRV+A5Y=', 'format' => 'json', )

Hi Oren,

As Matthew mentioned, attaching a code snippet or a pastie.org link would be VERY helpful in order to help resolve this.

Thanks.

Got the same bug. To reproduce simply call the default route without specifying it and add some GET parameters.

As example getUserParams() will return following array for the URI localhost/?a=1&b=2:

 
    <pre class="literal">array
      'b' => string '2' (length=1)
      'a' => string '1' (length=1)
      'controller' => string 'index' (length=5)
      'action' => string 'index' (length=5)
      'module' => string 'default' (length=7)

Created unit test for this issue

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        /**
         * @group ZF-9115
         */
        public function test_request_get_user_params()
        {
            $uri = Zend_Uri::factory('<a href="http://localhost.com/user/index?a=1&b=2">http://localhost.com/user/index?a=1&b=2</a>');
            $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http($uri);
            $request->setParam('test', 5);
            $config = array('mod'=>array('user'));
            $this->_invokeRouteMatch($request, $config);
            $this->assertEquals(array("test"=>5), $request->getUserParams());
            $this->assertEquals(array("test"=>5,"a"=>1,"b"=>2), $request->getParams());
        }


Could not reproduce, marking issue as resolved, could not reproduce.
