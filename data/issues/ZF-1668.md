### Description

The Zend\_Cache\_Core::save() is passing 'old' argument to the memcached backend's clean() method in a hard-coded way.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    Zend_Cache_Core::save()  line 320: $this->clean( "old" );
    Zend_Cache_Core::clean( $mode = 'all', $tags = array())


The following lines in Zend\_Cache\_Core::clean() method should resolve this issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ( $this->_backend instance of Zend_Cache_Backend_Memcached )
       $mode = Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_ALL;

I keep this task but the proposed code is not ok (all the cache will be dropped in case of automatic garbage collection with Memcached backend).

I will try something different.
