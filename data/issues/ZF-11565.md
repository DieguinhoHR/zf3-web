The status page is actually shown, but there are only 2 languages instead of the more than 15 existing ones visible

@Thomas: same behavior here. My native language is Brazilian Portuguese, but I can only see "Serbian Latin"

Any progress on this issue? I'm still viewing a page with only one language (today, Fran√ßais).

The welcome message for the #zftalk.dev channel links to this page instead: <http://mikaelkael.dyndns.org/checker/> The "official" checker is obviously broken, so it should be fixed or removed in favor of [~mikaelkael]'s
