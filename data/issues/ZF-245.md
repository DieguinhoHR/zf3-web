### Description

Here is a patch to make the assemble() method checks that the $data matches the regex requirement for the route variable:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if (isset($data[$part['name']])) {
        // *** patch begin
        $regex = (isset($this->_requirements[$part['name']])) ? $this->_requirements[$part['name']] : self::DEFAULT_REGEX;
        $regex = self::REGEX_DELIMITER . $regex . self::REGEX_DELIMITER . 'i';
        if (preg_match($regex, $data[$part['name']])) $url[$key] = $data[$part['name']];
        else throw new Zend_Controller_Router_Exception($part['name'] . ' does not match the required pattern: ' . $regex);
        // *** patch end
    } elseif (isset($this->_defaults[$part['name']])) {
        $url[$key] = $this->_defaults[$part['name']];


This will prevent the user generating invalid URLs.

It also doesn't check if default is meeting this requirement. Not only in the assemble but also in the match method.

I think it is programmers or webdesigners responsibility to create URLs correctly. If he submits incorrect value, he will quickly find out on a next URL check. I don't think that runtime checking is neccessary here. And since assemble will be called multiple times in a single request, I would like to avoid the overhead.
