ZF-6347: DefaultComplexType strategy doesn't support nillable class properties
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-04-19T14:20:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2013-01-22T21:12:50.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The DefaultComplexType WSDL strategy only uses the first type declared in the @var docblock of a class property. Suppose the following docblock:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /** @var int|null My nillable integer variable */
    public $myvariable;


In this case the variable is not considered nillable and a C# client (for example) will use the "int" type (which cannot be null) instead of "int?" (which can be null). There is sometimes a big difference between "0" and "null" for certain fields, especially booleans where null could mean "undefined".

Of course the following case also causes problems with the current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /** @var null|int My nillable integer variable */
    public $myvariable;


Only the "null" type would be taken into account, and, well, this is not a type.

This patch fixes the issue by adding the nillable attribute to the element node when "null" is present among the @var types. The first non-null type is used for the type attribute.

Wouldn't this only fix nillable complex types? What if you wanted to make a string member var null, like so:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    /** @var string|null Some var... */
    public $some_var;


The DefaultComplexType strategy, at least in my usage experience, doesn't handle those, as Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl does instead.

String member variables can also be null. Actually, it works with any type, and for example I use string, int and bool nillable class properties in a personal project.

DefaultComplexType iterates over the class properties, detects the "null" (with my patch), and then calls $this->getContext()->getType(). So getting the type goes back to Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl, yes, but only after detecting "null". Whether the actual type is a native type handled by Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl directly, or a complexType handled by a strategy, doesn't matter :)

Does this apply to class methods and functions as well, or would this be an issue of AutoDiscover?

This only applies to class properties (variables).

For class methods, you can make parameters optional (nillable) by giving them a null default value. This would only work with ZF 1.9 and the document/literal style though, as the rpc style doesn't let you use nillable parts. See ZF-6349 and ZF-6351.

Very helpful, thank you.

The .diff file, when applied to Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_DefaultComplexType, worked for me. Because Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeComplex extends the "DefaultComplexType" strategy, it too correctly picked up on the following php docblock:

@var string|null

...And made the variable "nillable"

Thanks!

PS - Any chance this fix can be applied to the trunk?

I think that this issue was fixed in trunk by [~rquadling] see ZF-10153.

My patch works by relying on a default value not being set for the property, rather than examining the different @var values.

e.g.

/\*\* \* Date Added \* \* @var xsd:datetime \*/ public $DateAdded;

becomes ...

in the wsdl file.

This is working for me (PHP) and my client's client (.NET based - I've no idea about their code).

Everyone happy.

And if you are wondering how xsd:datetime is working, I've made another patch to the AutoDiscovery code to allow for standard XSD types to be declared. Not 100% of them, but those I use.

I don't enough about getting my patches released, so hopefully someone can review them and make suggestions.

If I wrote:

class MyClass{ /\* \* @var xsd:dateTime \*/ public $myProp;

}

I obtain an error, while if I write:

class MyClass{ /\* \* @var dateTime \*/ public $myProp;

}

in wsdl I read "complex object" with namespase tns and not xsd. Why? How do I do for resolve this problem? thanks
