ZF-10826: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb signature error when posting UTF-8 data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

POSTing UTF-8 data to Amazon SimpleDb throws an error:

The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details.

The \_sendRequest function uses \*Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_URLENCODED\* for setting the \*Content-Type\* header which is \*application/x-www-form-urlencoded\*.

line 467 $request->setRawData(join('&', $params\_out), Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_URLENCODED);

It would be great, if the _Content-Type_ header could be set to _application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8_, which solves the problem. I don't think changing the Zend\_Http\_Client class is the right way, I'd suppose changing the Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb class only, eg:

$request->setRawData(join('&', $params\_out), Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_URLENCODED{color:red} . '; charset=utf-8'{color});

I am currently overriding this method in my own class to get this done correctly, but I needed to change the \_checkForErrors method from private to protected, as it is used in the \_sendRequest method.

Confirming this finding. Posting anything utf8 throws this exception.

The workaround helped. It's also quite elegant.

Alternatively, we could add a new constant in Zend\_Http\_Client for that, i.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ENC_URLENCODED_UTF8 = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8';
