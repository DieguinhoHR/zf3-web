ZF-8357: Add headers to Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Activemq -> send function.

### Description

There is no an elegant way to add headers to a sent message in Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Activemq. Specially I need to add the persistent header to make messages persistent on the server. I created my own adapter called XXX\_Queue\_Adapter\_ActivemqWithHeaders, but I can not subclass Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Activemq and override the function send because $this->\_client is a private member. So at least it will be nice to declare protected $this->\_client.

I had the same issue but I added an additional call to setHeader('persistent', true) in my own adapter that i created using Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Actvemq

How you make you own adapter ?. Because I also solved my problem copying the code and modifying it, but this isn't a nice solution!!! And as I said because \_client is private I can't subclass Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Activemq and change is behaviour.
