### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Interface and Zend\_View\_Helper\_Abstract (like action helpers) have method direct(). But it is not used. Method Zend\_View\_Helper\_$helper::$helper is used instead of it. Why?

BTW in action helpers the method Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_$helper::direct() is used but it was not declared in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract (or in interface).

Can you regulate it?

The abstract has a direct() method for forward compatibility; in 2.0, we plan to use that method instead of using the conventions based approach we currently have (where Foo\_View\_Helper\_Bar requires a bar() method, and which has Zend\_View invoking the bar() method). This falls in line better with the Strategy pattern, and makes maintenance and coding easier.

direct() is _optional_ in the action helpers, as action helpers are not required to implement it. direct() is used by the helper broker if the action helper is called as if it were a method call: e.g., $this->\_helper->redirector('index'). In many cases, action helpers do not have a mappable default behavior nor need one (example: the ViewRenderer primarily functions based on the various controller hooks, and simply has methods to allow setting state -- direct() would have no obvious behavior).
