### Description

How to reproduce: At shell:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # zf create project foo
    Creating project at /path/foo
    
    # cd /path/foo
    # zf show project.info
    Working with project located at: /path/foo
    
    # zf create project-provider foo doit
    Creating a project provider named foo in location /path/foo/providers/FooProvider.php
    Updating project profile '/path/foo/.zfproject.xml'
    
    
    # zf doit foo
                           An Error Has Occurred
     Action 'doit' is not a valid action.


Expected: _'no error'_ (and no real output because the provider action has not been implemented)

Why is that? Why docs does not cover creating project-specific providers?

Let's query available actions of "foo" provider:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # zf ? foo
                           An Error Has Occurred
     Provider 'foo' is not a valid provider.


Expected:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend Framework Command Line Console Tool v1.9.2
    Actions supported by provider "Foo"
      Foo
        zf doit foo


The xml looks ok. It contains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [...]
        
    [...]


Inside /path/foo/providers/FooProvider.php we have:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Abstract.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Exception.php';
    
    class FooProvider extends Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Abstract
    {
    
        public function doit()
        {
            /** @todo Implementation */
        }
    
    
    }


Looks clear to me... yet - it doesn't work!
