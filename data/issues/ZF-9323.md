ZF-9323: Zend\_Filter\_Compress archive should support array of files
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Compress can compress complete directories but it would be handy if it could compress an arbitrary user defined array of files.

eg:

$filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Compress(array( 'adapter' => 'Zip', 'options' => array( 'archive' => 'filename.zip' ), ));

$compressed = $filter->filter(array('file1', 'file4', 'file5'));

This does not work.

LZF for example can only compress strings... it does not accept files.

that's true - but 'zip' and 'tar' do support files. Zend even supports to zip up a complete directory, but not an arbitrary list of files. Hence this feature request.

I am also looking for exactly this functionality. Hope it is getting implemented.
