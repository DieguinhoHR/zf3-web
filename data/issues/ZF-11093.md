ZF-11093: Zend\_Json\_Server always returns error = null
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Perhaps in the version 1 of the JSON-RPC spec this was the correct method. However, in version 2 of JSON-RPC:

error This member is REQUIRED on error. This member MUST NOT exist if there was no error triggered during invocation.

I've made my client work around this rather than altering the ZF code, but it would nice to have Zend\_Json\_Server conform to the spec.

I see in ZF-8757 that the patch included is to deal with both version 1 and 2 responses. Hopefully that is the case. If so, this issue is somewhat of a duplicate and can be closed.
