### Description

I think it is better to name the Zend\_Dojo Component like Zend\_Js\_Dojo.

Than in the Zend\_Js component path can create more than one js frameworks in the future like: Zend\_Js\_Yui Zend\_Js\_Prototype Zend\_Js\_Scriptaculus ( extends Zend\_Js\_Prototype ) etc.

Furthermore in Zend\_Js can an interface/adapter to handle more js frameworks equal and the stable version is not released today.

The Component Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't name Zend\_Lucene

We will never be distributing other JS libraries or JS library integrations in the standard library, only Dojo; as such, keeping it in its own top-level namespace is an appropriate solution.

There may be other JS library integrations shipped via the extras library; we have not yet determined if we will require that these be placed under the ZendX\_Js namespace, or if each will have its own top-level namespace. Once such a component is reviewed for inclusion, we will make that determination.

There are benefits and issues with both hierarchical and flat structures, and we will be deciding which best suits ZF and its users for 2.0.
