### Description

The problem is originally reported by Craig Duncan in [FW-General](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Search_Lucene-dies-on-update-tf3475374s16154.html).

unset($index) doesn't really close the index and clean up resources.

script terminates at the moment of adding document with reopened index .

$index object doesn't really destroyed because it's referenced from some dependent objects (ex. document writer).

So changes are not automatically committed and not cleaned up. It's done only at the end of script execution. Index reopening may case deadlocks and script terminates because of this.

The problem may be solved with an additional "access controller" class (see details in FW-General)
