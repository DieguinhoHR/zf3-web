ZF-745: Request solution for result set metadata
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2007-01-12T15:38:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-01-09T14:10:30.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

Currently the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract interface supports fetching data values of a result set, but the metadata is not available. So there no convenient way to determine the original SQL datatype of a column; all column values are mapped to PHP scalars.

This is a feature request to add a method to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, and implement in each respective subclass, to fetch a special result-set consisting of metadata of the result set.

Notes:

PDO has a method getColumnMeta() but it is noted as "experimental" in the PDO docs. Not all PDO drivers are guaranteed to support it. I haven't checked the status of support for this method in the PDO drivers we use in ZF.

The PDO getColumnMeta() method returns an associative array for a single column (specified by the 0-indexed ordinal number of the column), with the following keys: - native\_type - driver:decl\_type - flags - name - len - precision - pdo\_type

MySQLi stmts have a result\_metadata() method, so this could support result set metadata. The result\_metadata() method returns a result-set object, which is an iterable collection of fields. Each field is an object. The documentation does not specify the members of this object.

The OCI API for Oracle has individual methods for metadata. So this could support result set metadata. The methods are: - oci\_field\_is\_null() - oci\_field\_name() - oci\_field\_precision() - oci\_field\_scale() - oci\_field\_size() - oci\_field\_type\_raw() - oci\_field\_type()

I would propose a new alternative fetch() method for Zend\_Db\_Adapter, to retrieve data combined with metadata in a canonical form. The adapter is responsible for assembling the metadata into this form.

Then a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row would also have a new method getMetadata() which returns an associative array mapping column names to a further associative array with attributes for the respective column. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row would always fetch the metadata for a query from the adapter. This might cause a slight performance cost depending on the adapter's implementation, but it is likely to be insignificant compared to the cost of the query itself.

Reset components to just Zend\_Db.

I wrote some considerations about this and other things on my blog: <http://tinyurl.com/2f38sq> <http://tinyurl.com/yr4lk9>

metadata retrieving should be untied from the zend\_db\_table and should work using the getcolumnmeta function, that should be released as stable (not experimental like now).

a feature that needs to be added is the table name of the field, absolutely needed when writing general code

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning as Ralph is the maintainer of Zend\_Db

How does Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::describeTable() not cover this use case?

What are the data types, string lengths, nullability, etc. of columns returned by the following query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) AS full_name, 
      GROUP_CONCAT(b.bug_id) AS bug_id_list,
      COUNT(*) AS num_bugs,
      SUM(b.status = 'OPEN')/COUNT(*) AS percent_of_open_bugs
    FROM bugs b JOIN accounts a ON a.account_id = b.reported_by
    GROUP BY a.account_id;


Result set metadata is about query results, not tables on disk. Queries may have expressions of different data types than any that occur in the underlying tables. If you capture that query and create a temp table based on it, you can see what I mean:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE foo   SELECT ...query above...
    DESCRIBE foo;
    +----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field                | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | full_name            | varchar(41)   | YES  |     | NULL    |       | 
    | bug_id_list          | longblob      | YES  |     | NULL    |       | 
    | num_bugs             | bigint(21)    | NO   |     | 0       |       | 
    | percent_of_open_bugs | decimal(27,4) | YES  |     | NULL    |       | 
    +----------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+


I logged this feature request a long time ago because the PDOStatement interface had a new function [getColumnMeta()](http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.getcolumnmeta.php) that Zend\_Db\_Statement didn't implement.

However, that PDO statement is _experimental_ and most (all?) PDO drivers don't implement it. Surfacing result set metadata through Zend\_Db\_Statement is therefore impossible, since the underlying drivers don't supply the information. So I would recommend postponing this Zend\_Db feature request indefinitely, or simply close it as "won't fix."

Marking as wont fix.

Since the votes are low, and the underlying delivery mechanism is marked as experimental, I see no other option. Lets re-evaluate when the new PDO comes around. ;)
