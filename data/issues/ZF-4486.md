### Description

PDOStatement has type Traversable. This is a php-internal type. To my surprise Zend\_Db\_Statement doesn't expose this interface. I expect at least Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo to be iterative. Iterator extends Traversable and this interface can be used in userland code. Implementing the Iterator interface for Zend\_Db\_Statement would solve this discrepancy. We can throw an NotImplementedException for rewind().

Perhaps we could use IteratorAggregate.

The getIterator() method could then return the PDOStatement, as return $this->\_stmt

Something like this works :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Db_Statement_Pdo extends Zend_Db_Statement implements IteratorAggregate
    {
       / ...
        public function getIterator()
        {
            return new IteratorIterator($this->_stmt);
        }
    }


But I don't know if that is THE solution.
