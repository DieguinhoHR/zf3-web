### Description

Many of the things you set with public add_() methods on a Zend\_Mail object, you can remove again using corresponding clear_() methods, but this isn't the case with headers.

There is the protected Zend\_Mail::\_clearHeader() method, but (unless I'm missing something) there isn't a clear reason why this isn't safe to have a public method for. One shouldn't have to extend Zend\_Mail just to clear a header, when there's already methods like clearRecipients(), clearSubject() etc.

The usage scenario where this would be handy is when you're looping through recipients within the same Zend\_Mail instance, changing some things (e.g. clearRecipients()->addTo('foo@bar.com') ), then calling send() again. You might've also added some custom header with addHeader() which you then want to remove and add _differently_ for the next recipient. Presently this is only possible by extending Zend\_Mail, or creating a new Zend\_Mail instance for each recipient (which may get problematic if you have things like attachments in the mix).

A public clearHeader() method could be as simple as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            public function clearHeader($headerName)
            {   
                $this->_clearHeader($headerName);
                
                return $this;
            }

Patch with test attached. Maintains protected \_clearHeader() method as a proxy for backwards compatibility for classes that have extended Zend\_Mail.

Would be interesting to know why \_clearRecipients() was made a protected method to begin with? Any ideas?

I don't know why the original author, of one of its successors did it like this. I suppose because he doesn't want the enduser to call it (doh ;D). Zend\_Mail suffers from a lot of this kind of decisions and a bad API-design alltogether. That is why I plan to do a rewrite of its core for ZF2, so we have something that actually works.

Patch applied to trunk and 1.11 release branch -- thanks!

Interestingly, on the subject of backwards-compatibility, this provides an example of how having to work around weaknesses in the API can actually cause a kind of backwards-incompatibility where framework users have extended classes to provide those work-arounds.

For example, my work-around for the lack of a public clearHeader() method in Zend\_Mail was to create a method in an extended class which did the reverse of what this patch now does (see my original description above). So if I upgrade now from ZF 1.10 to 1.11, I actually have to _remove_ my extended public method to avoid an infinite-loop method calling scenario.

Funny..
