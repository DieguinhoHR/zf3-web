The HtmlEntities filter uses [htmlentities()](http://php.net/htmlentities), which the manual describes as having a $charset option, hence its (get|set)CharSet() method naming.

The StringToLower and StringToUpper filters use [mb\_strtolower](http://php.net/mb_strtolower) and [mb\_strtoupper](http://php.net/mb_strtoupper), respectively, each of which has an $encoding option.

Thus, the consistency lies with the naming of the arguments of PHP functions used in the filters.

I suppose this could be changed, but which way is better, or what other way would be even better yet?

In any case, the old method names would not be able to be removed any time soon in the interest of backward compatibility.

ok I unerstand

but used variable names in php are only for documentation and the method names in zf are not. furthermore the names and/or arguments order in php isn't the best. e.g.: - in\_array ( mixed $needle , array $haystack [, bool $strict ] ) - strpos ( string $haystack , mixed $needle [, int $offset ] )

it is not useful keep method names in mind for all classes -> it is better to use the same over and over (for the same job)

In an other way you allocate [get|set]Encoding & [get|set]CharSet

in addition I am missing the get... method in Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower and Zend\_Filter\_StringToUpper

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

This should not be changed due to BC issues and functionality should not be duplicated. The API Doc and IDE autocompletion should give hints on how to use which validator.
