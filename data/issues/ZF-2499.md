ZF-2499: Consumer::verify() could be more verbose.

### Description

Consumer::verify() can return false in 11 different places. It would easily be my favorite OpenID library if it returned an error code or threw an exception instead of just returning false. This would make implementing and debugging consumer/provider code much friendlier.

I'm not sure how feasible it would be, but could verify possibly return Zend\_Auth\_Result?

it should also throw a Zend\_OpenId\_Exception in the places where it currently return false.

Now Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer::getError() may return explanation in case of login(), check() or verify() failure.
