ZF-3715: Add an internal cache

### Description

Quoting Matthew's email: {quote} A colleague of mine in a different division at Zend extended Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Request to add caching ability. IIRC, he created a map of methods that were cacheable, and would introspect the request to see if the requested method matched; if so, he could either return a cached response, or after the service was complete cache the result.

The fun part is that this can actually be done _before_ you instantiate the server and attach classes, which can have tremendous performance benefits. {quote}

No update? ;-)

Nope, no update. Unfortunately, the code was never conveyed to me.

Changes to the rpc classes make this easier -- the addition of Zend\_Server\_Definition makes it possible to theoretically provide this type of hinting. However, we would need to introduce some sort of plugin/observer system to the server class as well to accomodate it. Honestly, it's a big enough endeavor to warrant a proposal at this time.
