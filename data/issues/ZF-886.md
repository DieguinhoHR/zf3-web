### Description

The DAY\_SHORT constant refers to 1 or 2 digit long day numbers, but MONTH\_SHORT says "2 digit month".

HOUR\_SHORT\_AM also can be 1 digit.

I would like to change the MONTH constants like this:

MONTH -> 2 digits monthnumber MONTH\_SHORT -> 1 or 2 digits monthnumber

MONTHNAME -> full locale aware monthname MONTHNAME\_SHORT -> 2-4 letter abbreviated monthname MONTHNAME\_NARROW -> 1 letter abbreviated monthname

This would be more accurate and reflect the needs more like the DAY and WEEKDAY constants.

Your opinion ?

If we use MONTH\_NAME, MONTH\_NAME\_SHORT, and MONTH\_NAME\_NARROW, then I think your proposed changes are intuitive.

We should be careful to keep the docu sysnchronized with any changes to these constants.

However, this change might result in another inconsistency regarding weekday names. In PHP's date() documentation, weekday names are called "a full textual representation of the day of the week". Given the uniquely international flavor of the Zend Framework and community, is "weekday" or "day\_name" better for non-native English speakers?

Personally, I really like your proposed changes above, because "month\_name\*" is very clear to me, and should be easy to understand by non-native English speakers.

Better is weekday... because day always is related to day within month. And most other languages have weekday instead of dayname.

Which name would the day '12' have ?

You could say DAY\_OF\_WEEK or WEEKDAY... WEEKDAY is in my eyes better reflecting the coupling to WEEK instead of day.

I would like to have WEEKDAY (and I am non-native english).

Fixed with SVN 3337.

Month names were changed like this:

MONTH\_SHORT -> MONTH MONTH\_DIGIT -> MONTH\_SHORT MONTH -> MONTH\_NAME MONTH\_NAME -> MONTH\_NAME\_SHORT MONTH\_NARROW -> MONTH\_NAME\_NARROW

Docu must be reworked for reflecting this changes

{quote}And most other languages have weekday instead of dayname.{quote}

Ok. I only know English and some Vietnamese. This is good to know.

The name of day 12 depends on the year and month, but would be either Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc., but in the language selected by locale. I vote to follow your recommendation for keeping WEEKDAY, and now wonder about PHP's documentation for date(), where they use "day of week". Perhaps they should alter their docs ;)

Updating docu ....
