### Description

How it's possible to use Zend\_Identical Validator in Zend\_Filter\_Input ?

There is no way to pass other thing that 'text' in token.. i tried to pass fields=>'passF' doesn't work

StringEquals has been removed ? Why ?

On complete zf there is no Zend\_Validate\_Identical class..

Zend\_Filter\_Input not working with context but through of the Zend\_Form\_Element you can use context.
