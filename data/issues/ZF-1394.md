### Description

Large result sets (up to 100.000 hits) request is too slow. It should be optimized.

The ferst idea is: Score is usually (for Term and MultiTerm queries) calculated based on term freq, but Zend\_Search\_Lucene requests full list of terms positions. It can be omitted.

There are also some other places, which can be optimized.

Done.

It gave ~40% of performance increasing and reduced memory usage for ~25% (for large result set processing - ~30.000 hits).
