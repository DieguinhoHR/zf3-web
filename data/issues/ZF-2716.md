### Description

On behalf of Jon W. from the mailinglist:

It comes in when you start using the Zend\_Layout and using view varialbes inside the layout .phtml file.

see my attached application When you run it against the current code base it will show this out put.

NULL foo: This is the foo Action bar: This is the foo Action baz: This is the foo Action NULL

when it should show this output

string(5) "hello" foo: This is the foo Action bar: This is the foo Action baz: This is the foo Action string(5) "hello"
