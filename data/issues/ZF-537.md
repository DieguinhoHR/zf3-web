ZF-537: Handling HTTP 100 responses
-----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2006-11-11T02:46:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

If a web server returns an HTTP 100 response a "real" response will follow within that same response. An example response looks like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
    Date: Sat, 11 Nov 2006 08:41:23 GMT
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Length: 12704
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
    Date: Sat, 11 Nov 2006 08:41:23 GMT
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    Connection: close
    
    
    
    ...


This would result in the real headers being parsed as part of the body. The enclosed patch fixes this by discarding the 100 part of the response.

Note that this patch applies to Zend\_Http\_Client inside the incubator.

For testing purposes, can you provide a URL or PHP script that generates a 100 response?

Thanks

Absolutely. Here is a quick script that makes a request that generates a 100 response:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    set_include_path('incubator:' . get_include_path());
    
    require_once('Zend.php');
    
    Zend::loadClass('Zend_Http_Client');
    
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setUri('<a href="http://www.parkercountytx.com/Scripts/UVlink.isa/parker/WEBSERV/CriminalSearch">http://parkercountytx.com/Scripts/UVlink.isa/â€¦</a>');
    $client->setParameterPost('key', 'ThisIsATest', false);
    $client->setParameterPost('partytype', '0', false);
    $client->setParameterPost('status', '0', false);
    $response = $client->request(Zend_Http_Client::POST);
    print $response->getBody();

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

This should be fixed in r. 1885.

I've used a different fix than your suggestion because I thought it's better to handle this at the Socket level - If, for example, the second response (the 200 one) would have a "Content-length" header and the connection would be keep-alive one, we must parse this header.

If you want to look at my fix it's in Client/Adapter/Socket.php lines 172 - 174.
