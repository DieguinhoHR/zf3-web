### Description

I wonder that I can't create a SELF JOIN in FROM method of Zend\_Db class.

I use the following code:

$qry\_sel = $this->mdb\_conn ->SELECT() ->FROM(array("n" => "any\_table", "p" => "any\_table"), array("n.col1");

After the code

$this->mdb\_conn->query($qry\_sel);

was executed I only can see one alias table in from clause.

I would be very useful to set more than one table in FROM method.

best regards

You should be using the join method to join, even if it is to the same table you are selecting from.

Unless there is a use-case for having two alias' for one table in the FROM clause without using JOIN, I think this issue should be closed.

I tried to convert the following sql query but it doesn't work correctly.

SELECT n.name, COUNT(\*)-1 AS level FROM tree AS n, tree AS p WHERE n.lft BETWEEN p.lft AND p.rgt GROUP BY n.lft ORDER BY n.lft;

This is a sql query of "nested sets" method.

I also thing that it should be to complicated to expand this method.

I agree with Ryan I think this issue should be closed.

Try using the method as mentioned join.

[zend\_db\_select](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html)

I tested all these joins but nothing is good enough for it. I think the only way is to expand the from clause of the zend\_db class.

try

$select->from(array('n' => 'tree'), array('n.name','COUNT -1 AS level')) ->join(array('p' => 'tree'), 'n.lft = p.lft AND n.lft = p.rgt', array()) ->group('n.lft') ->order('n.lft');

echo $select;
