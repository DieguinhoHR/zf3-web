### Description

Hi, good evening.

I was requesting an external API who retrieves 1000 rows (as maximum) per iteration. So, in order to retrieve all my necessary data, I should call several times the same API. As soon as I've read the response (or even if don't do it) the response is stored in memory. I tried to unset the memory the object need doing unset, or setting null. But all my tries were unsuccessful...

I don't know why it's impossible to free that memory space and it's required for the behavior of my script.

Here is my code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    do {
      $data = array(
        'projectID' => $this->_iProjectID,
        'authTimestamp' => microtime(true),
        'search' => $this->_aSearch
      );
      $this->_oXMLRequest = new Zend_XmlRpc_Request();
      $this->_oXMLRequest->setEncoding('utf-8');
      $this->_oXMLRequest->setMethod('METHOD');
      $this->_oXMLRequest->setParams(array($this->_aConnectionData));
      
      
      $this->_oXMLRPCClient = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client(REQUEST_URL);
      $this->_oXMLRPCClient->getHttpClient()->setConfig(array('timeout' => '180'));
    
      $this->_oResponse = new Zend_XmlRpc_Response();
      $this->_oXMLRPCClient->doRequest($this->_oXMLRequest, $this->_oResponse);
      unset($this->_oXMLRequest);
      unset($this->_oXMLRPCClient);
    
      [...]
      more code
                
    } while($this->_iNextLoop < $this->_iMaxRows);


Do you have any idea why it's happening?
