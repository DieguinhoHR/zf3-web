Fixed in trunk, BUT this Parser and CodeGenerator are not yet documented and unit-tested though.

They were part of the original soap proposal and, according to Alex, are currently in an undocument uncompleted and not to be used for production status. They should probably be refactored to be part of Zend Tool sometime.
