ZF-6133: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname fails if Punycode is used for IDN
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-03-26T09:24:28.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-31T03:36:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

If ACE is used for an IDN like müller.de (which is xn--mller-kva.de) Zend\_Validate\_Hostname fails, because the ACE prefix has a dash in the third and fourth position. At least the IDNA prefix xn-- should be supported, as there are a couple of use-cases, that allow using ACE in RFC 3490.

As exposing the user to raw ACE should be avoided if possible the support for xn-- can be added as an option, which defaults to false.

Reproduce with: <?php require\_once 'Zend/Validate/Hostname.php'; $validate = new Zend\_Validate\_Hostname(); var\_dump($validate->isValid('müller.de')); var\_dump($validate->isValid('xn--mller-kva.de')); ?>

Result: bool(true) bool(false)

Expected: bool(true) bool(true)

Task can be assigned to me. Some feedback would be nice.

Supporting punycode raises some other issues which have to be solved.

One is coding: It has to be checked if the resulting IDN is supported after punycode has been translated. Second is length: Punycode produces longer strings then IDN which would fail when their length is checked.

I see this not as bug but as improvement as punycode is until now not supported.
