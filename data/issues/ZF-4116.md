### Description

1 - getValue method return the destination directory when there is no file submitted. It should return false or null, The bug in the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http class. (This still exist in the trunk version. Also i believe its the adapter problem) 2 - The validation not working as expected. (The validation working in the trunk version as expected) 3 - The class should contains receive method warp the $this->getTransferAdapter()->receive() call 4 - The Filter component don't have a MD5 or SHA filter and its very important filter for the file uploading mechanism. The receive method copy the file to a destination directory with the uploaded file name which in most cases not safe, I mean file name filtering. Zend\_Form\_Element\_File itself hold a NAME and adapter. We should be able to filter the file name for example md5(time())

Sorry, I edit the bug because i can't find the comment link :(

Thanks.

Filters are delayed until 1.7... actually there are no filters available.

Please give example code describing your problems. What have you meant with "validation not working as expected" ?

You have throwed 2 components and 4 issues in one. Please devide this next time, as it's easier for us. There are different authors for these components.

Please give us the release you have expect the problems with. Have you tried the actual trunk release ?

What should a MD5/SHA1 filter do ? Filters are build in to change the content of a file.

MD5 is supposed only to verify if a file has a MD5 hash or not. Did you mean a MD5 validator ?

Issue contains multiple duplications and no new issues... therefor it will be closed in favor of the other issues.

Regarding to the several points:

_1_ getValue of Zend\_File\_Transfer will always return the set directory and file. It will never return null when there is something set. This is not a problem.

_2_ When validation works in trunk, it's already fixed

_3_ This is a duplication of ZF-4062

_4_ This is a duplication of ZF-4123. Beware MD5 hashes are generally done for file content and not for file names.
