### Description

When using RFC 822 format Zend\_Date throws an exeption when the provided date has the year in four-digit format. RSS specifies that it uses RFC 822 and at the moment most RSS feeds are using four digits for the year e.g. the feeds on <http://framework.zend.com>. It should be changed to accept 2 or 4 digits.

RFC822 defines that the year value must have 2 digits. 4 digits are not allowed for RFC822.

From the RSS specification at <http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html>: "All date-times in RSS conform to the Date and Time Specification of RFC 822, with the exception that the year may be expressed with two characters or four characters (four preferred)."

This means clearly that the RSS date DOES NOT CONFORM RFC 822.

You should use RSS instead of RFC\_822 when you want to detect RSS feed dates.

Thomas, right you are. Then I would like that the reference guide be changed to note this. On the page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.consuming-rss.html) the pubDate is stated to be RFC 822 format. It should be noted that it is actually not and that Zend\_Date::RSS should be used.
