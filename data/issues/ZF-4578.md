### Description

Although I like the idea to have an F looking like the letter in ZF-logo it's nothing like an F.

Current:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ # /\_\_\_\_\_// # `____` # /\_\__// # `__` # /_// # `-` ##

Suggested:

- edit \* Tried to paste my suggestion here and in the comment field, but somehow the text got mashed. See the example in this post instead:

As this is your font, please decide what to do.

That font was intended as a test font. The F is supposed to look like the F in our ZF logo. Please see <http://www.jave.de/figlet/fonts.html> for an extensive font library. The tool available from the same site can help you create your own.
