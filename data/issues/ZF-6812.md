### Description

Based on <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6352> it seems that there is a problem while unserializing the object.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $paginatorObject = serialize($paginatorObject );    
    $paginatorObject = unserialize($paginatorObject );
    
    //broken UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
        var_dump($result);
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    //itareate to preserve UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
    }   
    
    $paginatorObject = serialize($paginatorObject );    
    $paginatorObject = unserialize($paginatorObject );
    
    //working UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
        var_dump($result);
    }


Thanks to TT

If this is a ZF issue, it's probably an issue for Zend\_Db. However, I wouldn't be surprised if this actually turns out to be an issue for PHP itself. Closing this for Zend\_Paginator. Zend\_Paginator only consumes DB queries and does not store them directly.
