### Description

The Docblock tag reflection does not handle descriptions like: @tag 0 because of wrong description existence check. This can be handled but it may be confusing.

The following change should fix this issue:

Zend/Reflection/Docblock/Tag.php -118: if ($matches[2]) { +118: if (!is\_null($matches[2]) {
