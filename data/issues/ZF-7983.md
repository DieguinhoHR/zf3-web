### Description

There is no obvious "forgot" password link from the user login screen of the issue tracker.

Upon entering an incorrect username or password, the user is redirected to the page:

<http://framework.zend.com/issues/login.jsp>

There is no information on this page explaining how to get the password emailed to an email address.

I just noticed that there is a link to a separate user management system from the left hand panel of

[http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/Dashboard.jspa)

but it's difficult to find (I missed it) probably because it's part of the text, and not near the username/password fields, where practically every other site on the web puts it.

Closing as fixed.

See <http://framework.zend.com/crowd> where you can edit your profile and also request a new password
