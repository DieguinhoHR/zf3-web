### Description

While running the entire suite I got this error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function gzopen() in /home/dolf/Projects/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/Zend/Filter/Compress/Gz.php on line 152

I suppose it should check for the availability of zlib/gzopen(), and if not available just skip those tests.

Note that this is a bug from an alpha/beta OS release. The OS (Ubuntu) delivers a broken ZLIB extension.

See <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zlib/+bug/439407> for details.

Resolving as "wont fix". Will reopen if this issue still occurs in the first stable release of ubuntu karmic.
