### Description

Joins like

 
    ->join(array('o2s' => 'object_to_store'), "(p.products_id = o2s.object_id AND o2s.object_type_id = 14)", array(), $select::JOIN_LEFT)


results in query parts like

(`p`.`products_id` = `o2s`.`object_id` AND `o2s`.`object_type_id` = `14`)

I am unsure what you are expecting, or how to reproduce what you describe as a bug.

Hi Ralph,

if I try to join a table with a column value as a second condition, column object\_type\_id with 14 as value, 14 will be handled as a column instead a value. 14 is surrounded with ` instead of ' or without any quotes, so it will be handled as column
