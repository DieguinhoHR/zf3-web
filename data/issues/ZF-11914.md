### Description

Found an error on line 1623 of Zend\_Form

You can read on that line: if (($oldName = $form->getName()) &&

When you should be reading: if (($oldName == $form->getName()) &&

So missing "=" for it to compare the values.

Sorry, after all the coder was just doing an assign of the variable inside the if statement.
