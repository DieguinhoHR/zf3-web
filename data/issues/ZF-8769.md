### Description

// Rewrote everything i wrote 2 days ago :/

For example, i made another token filter, that stems russian words. But as we know, there can be more than one baseform of word. So, here we can get help from token positionIncrement.

From docs about positionIcrenemt:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Some common uses for this are:
    * Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.  This is
    * useful if, e.g., a word has multiple stems.  Searches for phrases
    * including either stem will match.  In this case, all but the first stem's
    * increment should be set to zero: the increment of the first instance
    * should be one.
    */


Okey, so whats the best way to implement this ? As i understand, i should to rewrite everything, including Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer abstract class.

I want some improvements of api, that, for example, i could just add synonyms or all base forms ( as in my case ) for token.

I hope you understood, thanks ;)
