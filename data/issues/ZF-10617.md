### Description

If you try using the factory to create a new firebug logger like this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_log::factory(array(
        array(
            "writerName"    => "Firebug",
            "filterName"    => "Priority",
            "filterParams"  => array(
                "priority"  => Zend_Log::INFO,
            ),
        ),
    ));


you've got the following fatal error: Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Log in PATH/Zend/Log.php on line 30

Using normal instanciation does work though:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug();
    $logger = new Zend_Log($writer);
    $logger->log('Test message', Zend_Log::INFO);


Correction is to delete the following lines in Zend/log/Writer/firebug.php (lines 23 and 24) /\*\* Zend\_Log \*/ require\_once 'Zend/Log.php';

In your sample code first the a typo is _Zend\_Log_ and not _Zend\_log_. Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog and Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug uses constants of the class Zend\_Log by this the require\_once.

See a case of error if remove require\_once of the class Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Log/Writer/Firebug.php';
    $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug();
    $writer->getPriorityStyle(0);

Here a simple code reproduced and not found problem.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paths = array(
       /* define path */
    );
    
    set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $paths));
    require_once 'Zend/Log.php';
    Zend_log::factory(array(
        array(
            "writerName" => "Firebug",
            "filterName" => "Priority",
            "filterParams" => array(
                "priority" => Zend_Log::INFO,
            ),
        ),
    ));
    


Please provides more information to reproduced.

Greetings Ramon

Actually you are right the problem comes from the misspelling of Zend\_Log. I think that the class loader doesn't register the class properly the first time (using Zend\_log) and at the second invocation of the class (using Zend\_Log this time) the system crashes because it tries to register the class a second time (but the class loader registered Zend\_log not Zend\_Log)

Sorry for bothering for nothing and thanks for your reactivity.

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'not an issue' don't need a fix version.
