### Description

It seems that the method setReturnPath() is not working as it should and is not overwriting the default path.

Code example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $reqMail = new Zend_Mail();
    $reqMail->setBodyText($content);
    $reqMail->setFrom("some@email.com", "Name");
    $reqMail->setReturnPath('some@email.com'); 
    $reqMail->setSubject($subject);
    $reqMail->addTo('other@email.com');
    $reqMail->addBcc("anemail@yahoo.com");
    $reqMail->send();


The result email doesn't have the set ReturnPath.

I looked into this for the past hour and I am now not sure if this is considered a bug or no.

Facts: To have a Sendmail keep the ReturnPath you have to send an additional parameter to the PHP mail function, more precise "-femail@address.com" The send() method from Zend/Mail.php doesn't do that as it calls Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail with no parameters to be passed to the PHP function mail(). The workaround to this is to create a Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail object with the proper parameter before initiating the Zend\_Mail object, but this in my view will need you to set the ReturnPath twice, once in the call $tr = new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail('-femail@domain.com'); and the second time with the setReturnPath("email@domain.com") method from Zend/Mail.php

A better approach would be to change line 949 from the file Zend/Mail.php from: $transport = new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail(); to: if (!empty($this->\_returnPath)) $transport = new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail("-f" . $this->\_returnPath); else $transport = new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail();

This could have a side effect though...If the user runs PHP in safe\_mode() and he calls the method setReturnPath from Zend/Mail.php this will ultimately result in a PHP error due to the addition parameter given to the mail() function.

I am looking for your input on this.

Personally I think setReturnPath() is just wrong on Zend\_Mail, it should be a Transport option.

I agree with Benjamin.

I also think \_returnPath parameter should be move into parameter of transport.

And it might be better to split Zend\_Mail into 3 parts, for example : Zend\_Mail\_Sender Zend\_Mail\_Server (it would include transport classes) Zend\_Mail\_Reader (or \_Receiver)

I change this issue into next major.

I don't agree with the separation of names, however we should discuss this on the 2.0 Roadmap, can you add a note on the moving of setReturnPath() to the wiki page?

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Mail+sending+and+building+enhancements+2.0)

So we dont forget it.
