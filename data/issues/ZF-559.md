### Description

The coding standards should provide accurate docblocks that can be cut and pasted into code by framework developers:

<http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/PQ>

The current examples do not reflect de facto standards in the framework code base.

+1 for this ticket.

I'm feeling a bit confused. [Here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/PHP+Coding+Standard+%28draft%29#PHPCodingStandard%28draft%29-InlineDocumentation) you suggest to use a block with a license that is no longer the right one (see ZF-507).

Here ZF-703 Bill agree to include SVN $Id$ keyword in files but I can't find many files using it in the latest ZF release.

Many files have different copyright string with basically the same information

A definitive standard would be more than welcome. :)

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Thomas, aren't you working on this now? If so, please close this when you are finished. Otherwise, feel free to unassign it from yourself.

I'm working on the coding standard testbed which will then also close this issue.

Actually I've already fixed this issue for the existing files, but as new files are added we will for now have the problem also for them. See r9245 where darby added the header for a new file afterwards.

I will keep this issue opened until I have finished the testbed. Ralph and me are working on closing the whole bunch of issues related to this.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.

The Docblock is checked and forced by the new CodeSniffer ruleset. Actually all files within the core have the new docblock integrated.

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-09-02T10:39:21.000+0000

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
