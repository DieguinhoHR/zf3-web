ZF-4709: SSL / HTTPS Support for Routes / URLs
----------------------------------------------

### Description

Some applications (e. g. shops) require using SSL / HTTPS for some modules. Since encryption increases the server load it is not practical to use SSL / HTTPS for all (public) pages but for pages like logins or checkout processes only.

Therefore some links on "HTTP pages" should point to an absolute path including https and the complete domain - and vice versa.

Solution: Add an option to routes saying "use SSL for this route", improve the view-url-helper to create appropriate URLs.

Assigning to Ben Scholzen -- probably can be achieved with route chaining.

Implemented with r12313 into the hostname route.
