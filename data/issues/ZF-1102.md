Zend\_Session could be modified to throw an exception when the specified save\_path is not writable.

A lot of people like to set "ini" settings in .htaccess. We could skip the is\_writable check, if save\_path was not set using Zend\_Session::setOptions(). However, ignoring this group of people would allowing warnings for bogus save\_path's set in either php.ini or .htaccess. Alternatively, a new "no\_save\_path\_test" option could be added to Zend\_Session::setOptions(), thus providing a way for developers to explicitly disable the test, if they are not using files for saving their sessions, _and_ do not want to set a valid value for "save\_path". This latter option is not currently planned, since we are not investing extra effort for extreme edge cases yet (pre ZF 1.0). However, in principle, I do not see a problem with adding this option.

A totally different perspective: We should not check their PHP ini settings at all in ZF core components .. This is the job for Zend\_Environment, which should be executed everytime they change their environment or application configuration settings. (10:23:18 AM) cleanfunnyjoke: I could go to either of these 2 extreme perspectives .. they both appeal to me. For high performance situations, I would lean towards using Zend\_Environment from a cron job and avoiding the overhead of per-request checks/tests. However, we are not yet at ZF 2.x, Zend\_Environment is in incubator, etc. and we want to avoid premature optimizations.

Sorry for reopening, but fix in r. 4193 is not very good. I use a special session save handler (Zend's Session Clustering mod\_cluster) which does not care about the value of session.save\_path - so I have no problems starting sessions regardless of the value of this directive, but now I can't use Zend\_Session anymore.

In fact - looking at phpinfo() shows I have no value for session.save\_path so I am not sure the check is even valid (what is the default if there is no value?)

IMHO we should not try to "rape" the PHP environment by performing our own checks. PHP is _ment_ to show a warning when your session save path is not usable and I don't think we should override that.

Hi Shahar. We discussed this specific issue during the last devteam meeting and decided that the few people who are not using the default file-based session handler will simply have to fix save\_path by giving it a valid value, even though they might not need a valid save\_path. Some other options were discussed (noted above), but ruled out for now.

Why not set save\_path to a valid value?

Allowing PHP to emit warnings for invalid save\_path is contrary to our coding standards: <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/PQ>

I see - if the issue was already discussed I see no point in opening it again - although I am not sure it's our job to override warnings emmitted by the PHP engine (not by wrong code in a ZF class).

I will set my session.save\_path to something just to override these warnings.

I think this should be documented though.

Reopening issue in order to be able to close it properly and remove the "not an issue" resolution.

Fixes were applied (see FishEye link for information).

Now marking as fixed (see FishEye link for changeset information).

Although the devteam voted to not address the case where someone is not using the default files save handler and has an invalid save\_path, the patch required seems very small and required very little effort to create. So I've uploaded an experimental patch. Please test. Thanks.

Bad logic.. fails when ; is the first character. strpos needs to be checked strict against false.
