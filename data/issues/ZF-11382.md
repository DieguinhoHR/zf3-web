### Description

Have successfully created PDF using Zend\_Pdf, but cannot retrieve metadata. The code: $pdf = Zend\_Pdf::load($pdfPath); //I can open this PDF and am able to see and save the xmp $metadata = $pdf->getMetadata(); //$metadata is null

The xmp file, saved from the xmp dialogue box after opening the PDF is:

Is this still an issue? Can you supply us with the actual PDF so we can reproduce the issue?
