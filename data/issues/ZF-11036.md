ZF-11036: Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan does not validate for equal numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2011-02-04T09:34:52.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-08-26T17:58:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - Next Major Release ()

### Description

Doc for Zend\_Validate\_GreaterThan mention that equal numbers validate with this validator: {quote} Basic usage

To validate if a given value is greater than a defined border simply use the following example.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $valid  = new Zend_Validate_GreaterThan(array('min' => 10));
    $value  = 10;
    $return = $valid->isValid($value);
    // returns true


The above example returns TRUE for all values which are equal to 10 or greater than 10. {quote}

But both code and tests show that it is not the case.

Annotation in the source file indicate :

{quote}Returns true if and only if $value is greater than min option{/quote}

The documentation should be updated to reflect the code or the code should be corrected to match the documentation. It could be also considered to add a boolean param 'inclusive' in the constructor to decide if we want to authorize the $value to be equals the $min value or not (like for Zend\_Validate\_Between).

Thomas, can you indicate which way this is being fixed? I'm assuming that it will result in a doc-fix rather than code-fix, but want to make sure before I fix code that was expecting the documented behaviour.
