I decided to create an Issue just if someone smarter than me could do this. But i will try it myself to.

Cool idea.

Please note that there's this api you should be able to use: <http://framework.zend.com/api/zf-version>

@schimmel o didn't know that... very good.

@durand for example am i showing the current ZF version in my system module. it would be great to see if there's a new version available. shure theres mailing list, rss, bla bla bla... but simple: why not ;-)

Taking the cue i think it would be nice if we had a tag latest in the svn allow add svn:externals without need changes in each release ;).
