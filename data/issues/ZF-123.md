### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/142>

When we work in a STRICT mode and put a $\_POST array to constructor and we have no longer access to those data then it is not possible to check if the key was send in request. When we work in a non-STRICT mode we could first check if the key was send (eg. if (array\_key\_exists('my\_key', $\_POST){...}) and then filter this data through Zend\_Filter\_Input but then we keep data in 2 copies ($\_POST and Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_source). I suggest checking if requested key exists in each method or adding new method eg. existsKey().

[http://framework.zend.com/developer/browser/…](http://framework.zend.com/developer/browser/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Controller)

The new router (in version 0.1.4) will cleanly distinguish between:

 
    ?foo=bar ?foo= ?


Although not exactly the same issue, the final solution for both Zend\_Controller\_Action and Zend\_Input\_Filter should have consistent semantics. For example, null indicates parameter not available/given, an empty string indicates the parameter was supplied / is available, and a non-empty string would contain the value of the parameter.

We should be able to distinguish between the absense or presence of an input parameter.

If Zend\_Input\_Filter is altered, the rationale in the documentation might also need updating: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.inputfilter.html)

Patch to resolve most problems.

Adds the keyExists function as well as ensures that no notices are thrown in strict mode by using array\_key\_exists first.

Patch attached. Would prefer this makes 0.1.4.

Updated fix version/affects version as it may have gotten into scm too late to make the 0.1.4 rls. Original patch was submitted june 14. I dont have karma on this component so can't commit it if the patch is approved.
