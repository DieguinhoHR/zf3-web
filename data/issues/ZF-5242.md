### Description

Can we have example code showing end to end usage of Zend\_OpenID in action with Google and Yahoo as OpenId providers, please note that these two providers have a very different way of handling the protocol. Given the fact that most Relying parties will love to welcome Yahoo and Google users, this sample will be a real boon.

Thanks -Prem

What I see it is @todo OpenID 2.0 (7.3) XRI and Yadis discovery

The problem is - google and yahoo is most usable providers, and it is not possible to use zend openid service with them - so what is the reason of it at all? only myopenid?

There is no progress on it for a long time, it would be cool to have at least buggy version so we can test and provide feedback, but we have nothing. Sorry, very sad.

OpenID 2.0 support in general, just grouping it.
