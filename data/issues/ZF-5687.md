### Description

Hello,

I am testing some custom routes and i noticed one problem.

On bootstrap i am trying to set app to use just one route:

$router = self::$frontController->getRouter(); $router->removeDefaultRoutes(); $router->addConfig($config, 'routes');

routes.default.type = "Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route" routes.default.route = ":seo--1" routes.default.defaults.module = "default" routes.default.defaults.controller = "index" routes.default.defaults.action = "test"

If i am trying to dispatch an URL like that:

<www.domains.com/name--1> all is fine, os it's called the index/test action

But if i try to dispatch just <www.domain.com> the action dispatched is index/index !!!! Even if i removed the default route.

Also, i used this to be sure is fine:

self::$frontController->setParam('useDefaultControllerAlways', false);

But still is dispatched index/index, instead of an error or something like that.
