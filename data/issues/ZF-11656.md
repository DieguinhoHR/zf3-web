### Description

Sometimes we need to set the class attribute to a Zend\_Form\_Element in different moments. Every time I need to append a class to element, I need to get the setted ones, concat with the new one and set the class attribute again. Would be well useful if Zend\_Form\_Element implements something that able us to add and remove classes to Zend\_Form\_Element.
