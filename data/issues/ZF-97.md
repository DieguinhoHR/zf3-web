ZF-97: Zend\_Http\_Response: to support a status line without Reason-Phrase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-21T18:24:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:28.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.4 (29/Jun/06)

### Description

At the incubator version of Zend\_Http\_Client, Zend\_Http\_Response::extractCode method uses following regular expression code.

[http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Http/Response.php?r=trunk#l360) preg\_match("|^HTTP/[\\d.x]+ (\\d+) |", $response\_str, $m);

But some web servers return a status line without Reason-Phrase field. ex) HTTP/1.1 301 see: wget -S [http://amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/…](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4334033547/ref=nosim/)

To support these servers, it will be changed like this. Zend\_Http\_Response::extractCode - preg\_match("|^HTTP/[\\d.x]+ (\\d+) |", $response\_str, $m); + preg\_match("|^HTTP/[\\d.x]+ (\\d+)|", $response\_str, $m);

Zend\_Http\_Response::extractVersion - preg\_match("|^HTTP/([\\d.x]+) \\d+ |", $response\_str, $m); + preg\_match("|^HTTP/([\\d.x]+) \\d+|", $response\_str, $m);

I was not able to get a code-only response from the server you sent - but I followed your suggestion and fixed it.

Please test again with revision 694

Thank you :)

I tested with revision 707(sorry, I'm late), and the problem with the response without Reason-Pharse is fixed.

But I found another bug in Zend\_Http\_Client revision 707 at line 327.

- ((! $this->doStrictRedirects) && ($response->getStatus() == 302 || $response->getStatus == 301))) {
- ((! $this->doStrictRedirects) && ($response->getStatus() == 302 || $response->getStatus() == 301))) {

Please check it.
