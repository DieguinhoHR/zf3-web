### Description

Calling Zend\_Date->addMonth(340) returns a completely wrong answer.

Test code:

$test = new Zend\_Date(); $test->addMonth(340); echo $test.'  
'; // "Is bad: Jan 1, 1970 ..." $test = new Zend\_Date(); $test->addWeek(340\*5); echo $test.'  
'; // "Is good: Jul 13, 2043 ..." die;

You are probably overrunning the 32-bit integer used to store the date (ie: # of seconds since Jan 1 1970). Any date past 19.01.2038 03:14:07 ( =2147480047 ) can't be represented in "epoch time" using the 32 bit signed integer datatype. See: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=7103>

Indeed yes!

Yet, the documentation of Zends /Date/DateObject.php's `mktime` function says:

"The timestamp returned by mktime() can exceed the precision of traditional UNIX timestamps, by allowing PHP to auto-convert to using a float value."

So, in this case, the documented functionality is breaking.

Here's a fix that works for me, although I don't know the ramifications (if any). You'll notice a lot of effort has gone into the DateTime::mktime function to handle the case of year >= 2038, so my fix simply uses that as a fallback.

 
    // In Date/DateObject.php
    protected function mktime($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year, $gmt = false)
    {
        // complete date but in 32bit timestamp - use PHP internal
        if ((1901 < $year) and ($year < 2038)) {
    
            $oldzone = @date_default_timezone_get();
            // Timezone also includes DST settings, therefor substracting the GMT offset is not enough
            // We have to set the correct timezone to get the right value
            if (($this->_timezone != $oldzone) and ($gmt === false)) {
                date_default_timezone_set($this->_timezone);
            }
            $result = ($gmt) ? @gmmktime($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year)
                             :   @mktime($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year);
            date_default_timezone_set($oldzone);
    
            /**
             * The fix: check that system `mktime` returns something valid.  If not,
             * carry on, it might be better than giving up.
             */
            // return $result;
            if ( $result !== false ) {
              return $result;
            }


I hope you give this a fair shake, as it looks like a straightforward fix -- you've heard that before ;)

I just noticed that `mktime` returns -1 (instead of FALSE) prior to PHP 5.1, so that would be:

if ( $result !== false && $result != -1 ) { return $result; }

All the best, Derek
