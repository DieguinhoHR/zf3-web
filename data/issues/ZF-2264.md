ZF-2264: Zend\_Db\_Profiler enabled does not work with Zend\_Config\_Ini object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-12-03T21:55:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-19T02:22:58.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When configuring a db using Zend\_Config\_Ini doing something like the following does not work.

[default] db.adapter=Pdo\_Pgsql db.params.host=127.0.0.1 db.params.username=username db.params.password=passworrd db.params.dbname=mydb db.tparams.profiler.enabled=false

$zdb = Zend\_Db::factory($config);

This does not work because in Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php

line 326 $enabled = (bool) $profiler['enabled'];

expects a boolean but Zend\_Config\_Ini is converted to an array on line 313 $profiler['enabled'] is a string.

Fix:

change line 326 to

 
                // if from zend_config_ini need to check for string value
        $enabled = (bool) (($profiler['enabled'] == true) || ($profiler['enabled'] == '1')) ? true : false;

I notice a typo:

bq. db.tparams.profiler.enabled=false

Actually, this report doesn't make sense, because parse\_ini\_file() converts a value of "false" to an empty string "", which casts to boolean false. Resolving as not an issue. Please feel free to reopen with additional information.
