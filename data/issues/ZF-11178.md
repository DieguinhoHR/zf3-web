ZF-11178: Validate\_Hostname fails with Transport\_Smtp::helo() when using "localhost"

### Description

When sending mail through SMTP, Transport\_Smtp sets "localhost" as default HELO. It seems that Validate\_Hostname does not like that as it is not a "real" DNS hostname. At least I have an entry in my translation log that says that the message "'%value%' does not match the expected structure for a DNS hostname" could not be found in locale "en". Because of this log entry I assume that the validator failed and threw the corresponding error - otherwise the Translator would never be called to translate that message, would it? The email, btw, is sent without any problems.

I'm not sure if this is a bug in Validate\_Hostname or if the default HELO for Transport\_Smtp should be changed to something else like "127.0.0.1". When setting the IP there is no error logged, but it's not only when it's using the default - even when setting "localhost" explicitly in the options the error again occurs, so I think it's a bug in Validate\_Hostname.

Tested on SVN checkout from 15.03.2011. A discussion (German) regarding this issue can be found here: <http://www.zfforum.de/showthread.php?t=7856>

I've tried to reproduce this behaviour, but with the current trunk I've not been able to do that. Can you still reproduce it? If so, would you please include a small piece of code, so I can reproduce it too?

If this bug still exists, I'm willing to work on it.

Closing as not reproduceable Feel free to reopen when you have additional informations for reproduction

Please excuse this if it has been addressed in another bug, but i think that I have found the issue.

In the the isValid function in Zend\_Validate\_Hostname, if the name is not an ip address, ie. 'localhost' rather than '127.0.0.1', then the error message is set to Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::INVALID\_HOSTNAME . If the check against local network name schema passes, then the 'status' variable is set to true. In my case, I have set to $\_allow set to Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::ALLOW\_ALL, which , when anded with Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::ALLOW\_LOCAL withh return true. This gives us a case where the hostname is valid , however an error is reported
