ZF-2012: Validate type of set objects
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-09-28T12:04:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:47.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Whenever a method requires a specific data model element type to be set in the call, the type should be enforced.

For instance, calling $entry->setTitle requires that a Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Title be used. However, if you set a simple string, everything works with the set, but when saveXML or getDOM gets called, it's difficult to determine what failed-- because something like 'Call to a member function getDOM() on a non-object ...\*' is thrown.

I'm bumping this one back up to major, because this comes up commonly enough that I consider it a serious usability problem.
