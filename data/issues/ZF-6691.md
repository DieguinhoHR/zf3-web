### Description

Could we allow hyphen (-) in the charset in _Zend\_Form\_Element_'s _filterName()_ function?

Or have the ability to manually set the ID of the label's HtmlTag's Decorator? It currently relies on the element's name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Zend_Form_Decorator_Label
    // render()
            if (null !== $tag) {
                require_once 'Zend/Form/Decorator/HtmlTag.php';
                $decorator = new Zend_Form_Decorator_HtmlTag();
                $decorator->setOptions(array('tag' => $tag,
                                             'id'  => $this->getElement()->getName() . '-label'));
    
                $label = $decorator->render($label);
            }


May be overkill, but I want to prepend the form's id to all the element, dt, and dd ids.

Trying to achieve the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Email Address
    
    


But does this instead:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Email Address
    
    


I haven't had much luck with an easy work around for the label's ID. Any suggestions other than using custom decorators?

hyphens are not allowed in element names as element names may only be valid PHP variable names in order to allow overloading. We may review this decision in the future, but for now, that decision stands.
