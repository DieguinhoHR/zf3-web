### Description

Some Rest clients such as Zend\_Rest\_Client itself generate rest urls in this manner:

<http://server/resource?method=action>

These urls are currently not supported in Zend Framework's routing scheme, unless complex regular expression routes are used.

To solve this, I've written a Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_RequestVars, inspired by a blogpost by Rob Allen.

It is an extension of the default Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route, so it has the exact same features, with the addition of url parameter support.

Usage examples to create the above rest friendly urls:

new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_RequestVars(":controller", array("action"=>"method"), array("module"=>"api");

This creates a route where /product?method=find would be mapped to the product controller, the find action in the api module.

I'll attach the suggested code for Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_RequestVars to this ticket. I've tested it against Zend Framework 1.10.
