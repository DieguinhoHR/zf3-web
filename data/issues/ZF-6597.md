### Description

The following returns an result different from the manual:

$date = new Zend\_Date(time()); echo $date->toString('EE, dd.MM.YYYY');

I expected something like: Mo, 01.05.2009, but instead it returns: Mo., 01.05.2009 (note the dot after the name of the day)

Since the manual ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/zend.date.constants.html)) says 'EE' returns the localized day of the week (two chars) it actual returns two chars and the dot.

So.Mo.Di.Mi.Do.Fr.Sa.

This should be changed and the dot should be removed, since I does not need the dot in the result and there is no way to prevent it. If I need the dot I would explicit add it to the format string.

Please change it.

Note that "localized daynames" are dependend on the language. They are localized. This means for one language they are 2 chars, for others 3 chars and for some even 4 chars.

When you need other informations then eighter change the used date constant or change the used information type.

Additionally, please note that this data is used by multiple projects and we are not allowed to change it's content. It's origin is defined from unicode which collect this informations. So when you think there are problems with the content please fill in a issue at unicode so they can fix it.
