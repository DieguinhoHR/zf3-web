### Description

The documentation for extending Zend\_Tool ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.tool.extending.html)) in the section that reviews using the response object rather than echo'ing, shows the method getResponse() as an object property in one of the code snippets. It is immediately below the section header "The response object", and follows the sentence "Rewritting our hello provider with this knowledge it looks like: ". I cut and pasted the code snippet below, but the offending bit is "$this->\_registry->getResponse", which should be "$this->\_registry->getResponse()"

1. class My\_Component\_HelloProvider 2. extends Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Provider\_Abstract 3. { 4. public function say() 5. { 6. $this->\_registry->getResponse 7. ->appendContent("Hello from my provider!"); 8. } 9. }
