### Description

According to discussion of SL-13 getDefault needs some rework:

Method: getDefault()

Solution: Add routing, based on input, throw notice about changed behaviour

Information: searchorder and fastsearch were never really used this way. The simplest solution would be to route forward to getOrder and throw an user notice about the changed api and that it will be depreciated and erased in a future release (1.8?)
