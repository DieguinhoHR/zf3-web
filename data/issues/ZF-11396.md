### Description

As you can see from below, the "StripNewLines" filter is totally missing from the latest downloadable version of your software 1.11.6, which I downloaded and installed today.

[root@happy Zend]# grep -R "Zend\_Filter\_StripNewLines" ./ [root@happy Zend]# grep -R "Zend\_Filter\_Alnum" ./ ./Validate/Alnum.php: \* @var Zend\_Filter\_Alnum ./Validate/Alnum.php: \* @return Zend\_Filter\_Alnum Provides a fluent interface ./Validate/Alnum.php: \* @see Zend\_Filter\_Alnum ./Validate/Alnum.php: self::$\_filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Alnum();

It's available in your docs: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.set.html)

Problem in the documentation is [StripNewlines](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.11.6/library/Zend/Filter/StripNewlines.php) and not StripNewLines, see letter L is upper case.

As noted by Ramon, the filter name is case sensitive, so searching for StripNewLines will not find it (nor will it load using that case combination).
