### Description

I recommend indicating that an empty array() as the second argument in the from() method will result in no columns being selected. Also include a link to the join() method example 9.47 for further details.

I believe this is important information for users who are used to writing SQL queries without explicit JOIN statements. For example: SELECT p.\* FROM products p, sizes s WHERE s.product\_id=p.id

which is similiar to... SELECT p.\* FROM products p INNER JOIN sizes s ON s.product\_id=p.id
