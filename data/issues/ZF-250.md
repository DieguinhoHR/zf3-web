ZF-250: Zend\_Db\_Table: \_\_construct() uses Zend::registry instead of Zend\_Config
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The "registry" provided by Zend::registry is for developers to use, not for core ZF components.

Core ZF components should rely on Zend\_Config for any defaults.

Reference: function \_\_construct() { . . // use an object from the registry? if (is\_string($db)) { $db = Zend::registry($db); }

I think the idea was to use already initialized database object. It's not possible with Zend\_Config, is it? Maybe it should allow for passing a DB object through a constructor or even as a $config parameter?

Reassigning from Jayson to Bill Karwin, pending further triage.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

Using the Zend\_Registry is a supported usage of Zend\_Db.
