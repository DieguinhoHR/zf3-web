### Description

Some technologies are discouraging the use of RPC/encoded soap styles and are rather using RPC/Literal specifically JBossWS doesn't support rpc/encoded anymore, so it may be useful to consider this for next release of Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover since it uses rpc/encoded by default.

Luckily for me I found this thread: [http://nabble.com/Cannot-consume-SOAP-Service-td20â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Cannot-consume-SOAP-Service-td20688943.html) which seems to work fine. I don't know which is the tendency but meanwhile it would be great if we could have the ability to chose either styles.

Here is the code suggested on the post:

/\* 's _/ $operation = $wsdl->addBindingOperation($binding, $method->getName(), array('use' => 'literal', 'namespace' => $this->getUri()), array('use' => 'literal', 'namespace' => $this->getUri())); $wsdl->addSoapOperation($operation, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName()); /_ 's \*/
