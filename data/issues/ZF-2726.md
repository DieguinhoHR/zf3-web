### Description

Reported by Leonel Quinteros:-

Hi, i'm working with ZF 1.5.0PR and i have some models of PostgreSQL tables based on Zend\_Db\_Table.

I'm getting an error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception' with message 'SQLSTATE[42883]: Undefined function: 7 ERROR: el operador no existe: ` integer

I found that for Pg\_Sql, the adapter is quoting the field names with the character `and that is producing me an error. I tried the query generated by the adapter ( SELECT "bpusers".* FROM "bpusers" WHERE (`id` = '0') ) directly against the pgsql and results in the same error. If i remove that quote, the error disapears, but i cannot found a way to configure the adapter to not use that quotes o to use another character....

Unsetting 'fix version priority' until this issue is reviewed.
