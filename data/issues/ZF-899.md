ZF-899: new Zend\_Date() fails to throw errors when input does not conform to requested format
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When the requested format is explicitly specified (and not a "fuzzy" format), then new Zend\_Date() should throw an error when the input fails to match that format.

When a developer specifies a precise date $format for "new Zend\_Date($date, $format)", an error should be thrown on invalid input. Exceptions should be carefully noted in the documentation (e.g. Zend\_Date::DATES).

For example, if a developer requests Zend\_Date::DATE\_MEDIUM date format, but the input does not match the format, then an error should be thrown.

Fixed with SVN 3336

Only the standardformats (loose) Zend\_Date::DATES and empty format are fixed. For all other formats an exeption is thrown if f.e. day and year are switched, or day/months are negative and so on...

See Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate for details.
