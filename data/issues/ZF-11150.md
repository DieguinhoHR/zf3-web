### Description

Hi,

In the class Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry, the function setCommentCount() returns an exception if $count is empty... so it returns an exception when set to 0, which is a perfectly good comment count, don't you think? :)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setCommentCount($count)
        {
            if (empty($count) || !is_numeric($count) || (int) $count < 0) {


should be replaced with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setCommentCount($count = 0)
        {
            if (!is_numeric($count) || (int) $count < 0) {
