ZF-5957: Expose underlying Zend\_Db\_Select for Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable

### Description

Currently the underling DB Select object used for db-table auth is not exposed through a getter method.

Suggest changing:

 
        $dbSelect = $this->_zendDb->select();


To $dbSelect = $this->getSelect();

and adding a getSelect public method.

Purpose: to add additional clauses/predicates to the authentication -- eg an enabled true/false.

Can you add the proposed use case code?

    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable(
                       $db,
                       'users',
                       'username',
                       'password',
                       'md5(?)'
                     );
    
    $adapter->setIdentity($params->username)
                    ->setCredential($params->password);
    
    $adapter->getSelect()->where('enabled = ?', true);

The added method name is getPreauthenticationDbSelect(), its been asked to shorten it to getDbSelect(), ... there are a couple of reasons for the length and conciseness of name: \* this method name spells out that the select object is provided pre-authentication time and will not contain any of the identity and credential information \* on subsequent retrieval of this object (Even after an authenticate() call), the object will retain the same state that it had prior to any of the previous authenticate() calls \* this method is considered _advanced_ usage, and developers should fully understand it before using it. the longevity of the name is an attempt at discouraging "drive-by" usage.

Why not "getDbAuthSelect()"?
