ZF-2339: Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_\_construct() should type hint config array

### Description

Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_\_construct() expects an array or an empty array but no type hint is given. "public function \_\_construct(array $config = array())" would work quite well.

Type-hinting to array would not allow us to later allow Zend\_Config objects for configuring Zend\_View (a change that is already being considered).

Configuring Zend\_View by passing an instance of Zend\_Config to the constructor would introduce an incosistency with other framework components. In other components (such as Route, etc.pp) there are always special factories and setters for passing a configuration object. There is also an outstanding proposal to generalize that, Zend\_Config\_Configurable. On the other hand, configuring Zend\_View with Zend\_Config would nevertheless be possible, as Zend\_Config::toArray() is present.

This is simply not true. There are a number of instances in the framework where constructors or factories _can_ accept a Zend\_Config object, and we are actually moving to support this in more places. In each case, we do _not_ type hint, to allow passing arrays _or_ Zend\_Config objects (or, in some cases, scalar configuration). An excellent example of this paradigm is the new Zend\_Form component.

The reason I have marked this as "Won't Fix" is so that we can support passing _either_ arrays _or_ a Zend\_Config object.
