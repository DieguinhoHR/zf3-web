### Description

i guess it's a very specific need of mine. for avoiding data overload at some point i query only for records' ids sorted by other descriptive field. all that in a pagination context. the code can be summarized as follows:

$table = new My\_Table(); $select = $table->select(false); $select->from($table, 'id\_field'); $select->order('description\_field'); $select->limit(20, 10); $statement = $select->query(); # crashes here

as i'm using pdo\_mssql adapter and it has a workaround for the limit() method, the generated query is this:

SELECT \* FROM ( \_\_SELECT TOP 20 \* FROM ( \_\_\_\_SELECT TOP 30 "my\_table"."id\_field" FROM "my\_table" ORDER BY "description\_fied" ASC \_\_) AS inner\_tbl \_\_ORDER BY "my\_table" DESC ) AS outer\_tbl ORDER BY "description\_field" ASC

the inner\_tbl has only "id\_field" and the outermost select tries to order by "description\_field".

the simplest workaround is to select both id and description fields but it would be great to see this bug fixed in the framework.

thanks in advance.
