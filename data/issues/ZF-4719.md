### Description

For dates of December 29, 30, and 31 2008, toString() outputs 2009 values for year.

Test code:

<?PHP require "Zend/Date.php";

$dates = array('2008-12-25','2008-12-26','2008-12-27','2008-12-28','2008-12-29','2008-12-30','2008-12-31','2009-12-28','2009-12-29','2009-12-30','2009-12-31');

foreach($dates as $date){

 
               $testDate = new Zend_Date($date);
    
               echo $date . ":\t" . $testDate . ":\t". $testDate->toString('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') . "\n";


}

Output:

2008-12-25: Dec 25, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2008-12-25 00:00:00 2008-12-26: Dec 26, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2008-12-26 00:00:00 2008-12-27: Dec 27, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2008-12-27 00:00:00 2008-12-28: Dec 28, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2008-12-28 00:00:00 2008-12-29: Dec 29, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-29 00:00:00 2008-12-30: Dec 30, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-30 00:00:00 2008-12-31: Dec 31, 2008 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-31 00:00:00 2009-12-28: Dec 28, 2009 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-28 00:00:00 2009-12-29: Dec 29, 2009 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-29 00:00:00 2009-12-30: Dec 30, 2009 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-30 00:00:00 2009-12-31: Dec 31, 2009 12:00:00 AM: 2009-12-31 00:00:00
