Hope I'm not being too pedantic, but wouldn't it be cleaner to replace:

 $last = substr($value, -1, 1); if (($last != '/') and ($last != '\\')) { $value = $value . '/'; }

with

 $value = rtrim($value, DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR) . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR;

...and that way you're letting PHP take care of the OS-specific separator

fixed on CVS (thanks)

I changed some other '/' into DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR. If you have a windows test platform, may you check if it's ok ? (i have only linux boxes)

thanks
