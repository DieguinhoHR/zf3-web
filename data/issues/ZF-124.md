### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/146>

Since the render() method is dependant on a subclass to carry out the \_run() function it would be more complete, particularly with regards to self-documentation, to have the following method...

abstract protected function \_run() {}

...in Zend\_View\_Abstract.
