ZF-1536: Zend\_Filter\_Input should have an isValid() method
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Input lacks a isValid() method. The manual proposes you use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($zfi->hasMissing() || $zfi->hasInvalid()) {
    ...
    }


but a single call to isValid() makes more sense. I attached the super small 3 line patch ;)

I did something similar to the patch, but not exactly.

Committed in revision 5273.
