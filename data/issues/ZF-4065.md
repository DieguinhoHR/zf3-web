ZF-4065: Cast variables from getParam(), getPost(), getQuery().
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I think this would be a nice improvement if people were able to cast variables from Zend\_Controller\_Abstract::getParam(), etc..

What I mean is, for example (inside a controller):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $id = $this->_request->getParam('id', null, Zend_Controller::INT);
    if ($id === null) {
    // do something else
    }
    echo $id; // it's an integer, WOOHOO.


I'd propose to have at least: - integer (Zend\_Controller::INT) - float (Zend\_Controller::FLOAT) - string (Zend\_Controller::STRING) - boolean (Zend\_Controller::BOOL)

This feels like feature creep to me. Casting is already built into the language, and it's trivial to add the call after doing your test.

Those of you reading this, if you have a strong position either way, please comment.

What's wrong with this?

$id = (int) $this->\_request->getParam('id'); $id = (float) $this->\_request->getParam('id'); $id = (string) $this->\_request->getParam('id'); $id = (bool) $this->\_request->getParam('id');

@Dolf

Nothing really, but e.g. $id = (int) $this->\_request->getParam('id'); become 0 (int) and not really null. So my check for === null would fail, wouldn't it? I could always go empty() but that's different.

@Matthew

It would be optional, maybe a convenience feature.

I would prefer a paka Yoke filtering ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_Controller+2.0)) instead of simple casting

PHP is a loosely typed language, and ZF tries to leverage this as much as possible. If strong typing is needed, you can extend the request object to do this, or simply cast the return value, but we have no desire to support such functionality directly.
