### Description

Hello,

I'm using Zend\_Controller in a specific way : executing one action specific (I'm using it as a CLI) and an error is raised : Fatal error: Call to a member function notifyPreDispatch() on a non-object in /usr/share/pear/Zend/Controller/Action.php on line 490

Here is atomic PHP code used (I removed everything unnecessary) :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?php
    
    define('CWD', realpath(dirname(__FILE__).'/../').'/');
    set_include_path (CWD.'library' . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
    
    require_once "Zend/Loader.php";
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $req = new Zend_Controller_Request_Simple(null,'Convert'); //Calling application/ConvertController.php
    $front->setRequest($req);
    $front->setRouter(new Crons_Controller_Router_Cli());
    $front->setControllerDirectory(CWD.'application');
    $front->dispatch();
    
    class Crons_Controller_Router_Cli extends Zend_Controller_Router_Abstract implements Zend_Controller_Router_Interface {
        public function assemble($userParams, $name = null, $reset = false, $encode = true) {    }
        public function route(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $dispatcher) { }
    }
    


In line 490, Zend\_Controller\_Action is calling $this->\_helper->notifyPreDispatch(); As there is no helper, fatal error occured. Same thing with $this->getRequest()->isDispatched(), because getRequest is not an object too.

So : - Fatal error is bad, we should have an exception that something is missing (if it is the case) - Second, if I made something wrong in my example, what is it ? I have no need of helpers, and I don't know why $this->getRequest() does not return an object.

$\_helper is initialized in the action controller's constructor, and should be an instance of Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker. The only reason it would not exist is if you have created a base action controller class, overridden the constructor, and not called parent::\_\_construct(). I'm guessing this is the case, as that is where the request object is injected into the action controller as well, which would explain why $this->getRequest() does not work.

When extending Zend\_Controller\_Action, use the init() method to perform custom object initialization to ensure that all necessary objects are registered correctly.
