### Description

The formRadio view helper takes a $listsep argument, which is used to separate the inputs in the generated HTML.

This argument does not appear in the [manual page on view helpers](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html). It also doesn't appear in the phpdoc for Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormRadio::formRadio.

In a separate but related issue, the [generated API docs](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/_View_Helper_FormRadio.html#Zend_View_Helper_FormRadio::formRadio()) don't show the default value of "  
\\n". The HTML in the default value is not being escaped, so it looks like the default value is just \\n.

Thank You for report, but it is duplicated by ZF-9185.
