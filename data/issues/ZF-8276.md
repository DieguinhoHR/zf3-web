### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.baseurl) in this example the helper is used with the base html tag ([http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag\_base.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_base.asp)), but this tag needs an absolute url (with the domain part) this helper removes it, why?
