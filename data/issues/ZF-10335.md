ZF-10335: assertXpathContentContains fails on matched '0'
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-08-18T14:27:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:56.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

tried to do something like this in my tests

$this->assertXpathContentContains('//form/p', '0');

and it fails test, even if '//form/p' contains exactly '0'

found method in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Constraint\_DomQuery /\*\* \* Check to see if content is matched in selected nodes \* \* @param Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Result $result \* @param string $match Content to match \* @return bool \*/ protected function \_matchContent($result, $match) { if (0 == count($result)) { return false; }

 
        foreach ($result as $node) {
            $content = $this->_getNodeContent($node);
            if (strstr($content, $match)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    
        return false;
    }


looks like this line

if (strstr($content, $match))

should be

if (strstr($content, $match) !== false)

becouse strstr('0', '0') return string '0', that is equals bool false...

I can confirm this is still an issue. I wanted to add that it also is true for the related CSS version: assertQueryContentContains.

Doing some additional testing, I find that assertXpathCount (and assertQueryCount) work as expected. Assuming these functions maintain DRY... :-) it appears the Zend\_Dom\_Query portion of the code is working, and the problem is related specifically to the node or string matching being used.
