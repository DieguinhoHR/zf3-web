### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/30>

While developing it would be handy to have a default indexAction() which displays all the other actions.

Even better would be to detect the arguments that each action takes and provide a form field to fill them out manually and submit to the action.

While this would be nice in development, it would be a security liability in production. Additionally, this can be done by individual developers by extending Zend\_Controller\_Action with the requested functionality, without needing to change anything in the framework.

Request already possible in userland by extending the action controller; functionality not desired for framework core.

Removing fixed version, it is irrelevant for this resolution.
