ZF-1778: Mysqli: Statement object cannot be reused

### Description

The Mysqli adapter has a bug that fetchAll() does not free the statement, and thus a subsequent statement fails silently, if we try to use the same Statement object.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('mysqli', ...);
    $stmt1 = $db->query('SELECT ...');
    $result1 = $stmt1->fetchAll();
    
    $stmt1 = $db->query('SELECT ...');
    $result2 = $stmt1->fetchAll();


The second result is always empty, because the Mysqli connection cannot execute a new query until the old one is closed properly.
