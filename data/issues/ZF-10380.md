### Description

I am using the static parse function of QueryParser to parse the query before using it to search the index. A problem occurs if a query is entered as follows:

$term = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse("Some product and accessory - NEW");

When the search query includes both a boolean word such as "and" and a sign operator such as "-" the following fatal error is thrown:

"It's not allowed to mix boolean and signs styles in the same subquery."

This affects my project on ZF 1.10.7 on PHP 5.3.0. The query above works perfectly fine with ZF 1.9.7 on PHP 5.2.
