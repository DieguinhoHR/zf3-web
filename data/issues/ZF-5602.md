ZF-5602: Wrong/misleading option 'host' vs 'baseUrl' in Zend\_Service\_Nirvanix

### Description

In the \_\_construct() function of Zend\_Service\_Nirvanix, there's an array $defaultOptions that contains some options:

$defaultOptions = array('defaults' => array(), 'httpClient' => new Zend\_Http\_Client(), 'host' => '<http://services.nirvanix.com>');

The key 'host' seems not to have any effect on the operation of this class, though. If we look in Zend\_Service\_Nirvanix\_Namespace\_Base, it contains:

protected $\_host = '<http://services.nirvanix.com>';

.. which can be configured via the 'baseUrl' option passed to Zend\_Service\_Nirvanix. Changing the 'host' option doesn't seem to have any effect; even passing array('host' => 'gobbledygook.random.url') as the $options param still lets you make calls to the Nirvanix service perfectly fine.

So I would suggest that at the least, the 'host' key were to be changed to 'baseUrl' in the $defaultOptions array to avoid confusion. Or, to avoid redundant variable definition, remove the 'host' option from the array altogether as it is specified in Zend\_Service\_Nirvanix\_Namespace\_Base. (although I then suggest it should be documented that passing the 'baseUrl' option changes the host that will be used)
