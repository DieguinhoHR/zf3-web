ZF-10259: CLONE -"max" option of Zend\_Form StringLength validator considered as "min" option when "min" option is omitted

### Description

When you create a form element from .ini file, and add a StringLength validator to your element with a .max option but without .min option, then .max is wrongly interpreted as .min.

_Example_:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    user_details.elements.firstname.options.validators.strlen.validator = "StringLength"
    user_details.elements.firstname.options.validators.strlen.options.max = "30"

Let's say I input "foo" as firstname _Actual result_:{quote} - form does not validate - following error message is displayed: 'foo' is less than 30 characters long {quote} _Expected result_:{quote} - form should validate - no error should be displayed {quote} NOTE: this bug may impact other validators as well. Problem comes from Zend\_Form\_Element::\_loadValidator() ``` $validator['options'] is passed to constructor without taking into consideration options name<

_Temporary workaround_: - always specify a min length as well (set it to 0)

Witnessing this EXACT same behavior using both 1.10.5 and 1.10.7

Same workaround temporarily resolves problem.

Unable to reproduce. Please give additional information for reproduction.

The following test does not fail (but should according to your description):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testValidatorsGivenArrayKeysOnValidation2()
        {
            $firstname = new Zend_Form_Element('firstname');
            $firstname->addValidator('StringLength', true, array('max' => 30));
            $form = new Zend_Form(array('elements' => array($firstname)));
            $this->assertTrue($form->isValid(array('firstname' => 'abcde')));
        }

My mistake. The configuration of this site accidentally pointed Zend references to a copy of the 1.9.2 Framework instead of the current release.

Thank you for your help.
