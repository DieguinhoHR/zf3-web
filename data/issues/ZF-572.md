### Description

This notice appear when i call save() method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object, sample:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $contents = new Contents();
    $content = $contents->fetchRow("id = ".$content_id);
    $content->size = intval($file['size']);
    $content->save();


$contents it is Zend\_Db\_Table object, $content of course Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row Error in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row class in \_refresh() method on line 203, because $fresh isn't object is an array:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $fresh = $this->_table->find($this->_data[$this->_info['primary']]);
    // we can do this because they're both Zend_Db_Table_Row objects
    $this->_data = $fresh->_data;


This can be solved with this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $fresh = $this->_table->find($this->_data[$this->_info['primary']]);
    // we can do this because they're both Zend_Db_Table_Row objects
    $this->_data = $fresh;
