ZF-9888: Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Db\_Operation\_Truncate Fails On A MS SQL Server Table With A Foreign Key Relation

### Description

Truncate command fails on sql server when the table has foreign key relations. This is expected. Instead the truncate command should do a "delete" operation and then reset the index key. The following SQL Transact functions will do the same as truncate and will work on a table with a FK relation:

DELETE from "table\_name" DBCC CHECKIDENT("table\_name", RESEED, "reseed\_value")

=========== code to reproduce ================

$connection = new Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Db\_Connection($db, 'users'); $dbTester = new Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Db\_SimpleTester($connection);

// getDataSetFile returns path to an xml file with $dbFixture = new PHPUnit\_Extensions\_Database\_DataSet\_FlatXmlDataSet($this->getDataSetFile());

$dbTester->setupDatabase($dbFixture);

================================================

============= Database ==================== table: users

relate users to another table.
==============================

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Db expects you to sort the tables in the XML files in an order that allows for a non-conflicting FK truncation. Since it cannot know which is the correct order without doing lots of inference.

If you don't want that you can add your own Set Up Operation using PHPUnit's APIs.

I've done that (backwards order)

 <= relates to users

When truncate is ran, the "roles" table is wiped out and then it fails on "users"

TRUNCATE will not work on MS SQL SERVER tables that have a relation, no matter if they are empty or not: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/â€¦](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177570.aspx)
