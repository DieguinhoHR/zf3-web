### Description

Rater confusing bug. I have not investigated it all that through, I figure the writer of the component will be better at this.

When a required field is missing and another field whose validator is the first defined is filtered to become empty

This other field will be reported as unknown. [EDIT: unknown, not missing]

Code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    require 'Zend/Filter/Input.php';
    
    header("Content-Type: text/plain");
    
    $filters = array(  
        'field1'   => 'Digits',
        'field2'   => 'Alnum'
    );
     
    $validators = array(  
        'field1'   => array('Digits'),
        'field2'   => array('Alnum'),
        'field3' => array('Alnum','presence'=>'required')
    );
    $data = array('field1'=>'asd1','field2'=>'â‚¬'); // Invalid data
    $input = new Zend_Filter_Input($filters, $validators, $data); 
    
    if ($input->hasInvalid()) {  
        $invalidFields = $input->getInvalid(); 
        echo "Invalid:\n";
        print_r($invalidFields);
    }  
      
    if ($input->hasMissing()) {  
        echo "Missing:\n";
        $missingFields = $input->getMissing();  
        print_r($missingFields);
    }  
      
    if ($input->hasUnknown()) {  
        echo "Unknown:\n";  
        $unknownFields = $input->getUnknown();  
        print_r($unknownFields);
    }


Hope it is not just me that is missing something

I have just checked out revision 5265.

It does not seem to solve the problem with the given test code.

Okay, try revision 5268.
