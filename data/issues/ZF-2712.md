### Description

As discussed on #zftalk, we need to do the following with Zend\_Form\_Element:

- If an element is required and does not contain a NotEmpty validator, add one to the top of the validator stack with the breakChainOnFailure flag set to true
- Add a flag and accessors that allow disabling the above behaviour on request.

This will enforce the semantic meaning of the required flag.
