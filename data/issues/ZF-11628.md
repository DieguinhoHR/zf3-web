ZF-11628: DijitParam "required" collides with the HTML5 attrib
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-07-30T15:42:35.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-07-12T14:02:44.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitElement always sets the "required" attribute since issue #7660:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dijitParams['required'] = $element->isRequired();


This causes invalid browser behavior as the HTML5 "required" attribute ([http://w3schools.com/html5/â€¦](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_form_attributes.asp)) defines an element as required if the attribute is present, regardless of the attribute value. So e.g. Firefox 5 displays "Fill out this element" on hover.

Rendering a non-required Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text in an dojo-enabled (programmatic mode) form results in following html:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Additionally: Shouldn't the attribute be rendered as required="false" / required="true" as other boolean attributes are rendered in Zend\_Dojo\_ and as it was before the changes of #7760?

Required elements render with "1" as attribute value instead of "true":

 
    <pre class="highlight">

Check ZF-11953, I just posted a workaround.
