### Description

When passing an array to the FormSelect-Helper, where an element in the array has a key but an empty value, the component generates an emtpy option-tag like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    AFAIK this does not conform to XHTML standards (at least my Tidy-Plugin in Firefox nags about it). So if there is no label for an option, it should be closed like this:

Actually, the current behaviour is correct; see [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C\_3](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_3) . The option tag is expecting content, and thus should not use the minimized form when empty.

Behaviour is correct according to the w3c XHTML 1.0 DTD.
