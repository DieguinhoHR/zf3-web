ZF-6994: Use join() instead of foreach() in Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::outputBody()

### Description

outputBody() currenty iterates over its \_body Property and outputs every element in that property. We saw in a Magento benchmark, that this can be a small performance penalty with a lot of content elements. So we tried join() it was much faster. See micro benchmark and patch attached. I would guess this is because of more comprehensive memory usage (less alloc(), less free()).

Here is the benchmark result: join(): 0.0016419887542725ms foreach(): 0.024167776107788ms

Note: Run the benchmark with php > /dev/null to see the result which is written to STDERR.

Patch and benchmark.

Any news on that? We experienced a good improvement of speed when working with Magento. It's pretty simple and it doesn't break any tests.

Patch committed to trunk and 1.9 release branch. Used implode() instead of join(), as join() is deprecated in 5.3.
