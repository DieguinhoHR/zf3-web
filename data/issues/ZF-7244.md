### Description

When use case insensetive analyzers lucene work good. But sortings are always case sensetive. It would be good to have such option. Because I really think that word "apache" should be before word "Zend" if I sort as Strings. It could be fixed very easy like this :

near line 990 of Zend\_Search\_Lucene class.

$valuesArray = array\_map('mb\_strtolower', $valuesArray); $sortArgs[] = $valuesArray;

Can you post a full code example. This seems to work for me with

$hits = $index->find($query, '$field', SORT\_STRING, SORT\_DESC);
