ZF-8538: DB adapter could provide a date format string

### Description

As discussed there: [http://n4.nabble.com/Zend-Date-and-MySQL-datetime-â€¦](http://n4.nabble.com/Zend-Date-and-MySQL-datetime-td645665.html)

it would be useful if database adapters could provide a method to retrieve a format string corresponding to their date storage format.

Currently we have to do this (taking mysql date format as example):

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $date = new Zend_Date($dateFromDb, 'YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');


or this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateToDb = $date->toString('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');


What would be great is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date($dateFromDb, $dbAdapter->getDateFormat());


or this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateToDb = $date->toString($dbAdapter->getDateFormat());


It does not require much more code nor makes Zend\_Date heavier, but it saves the hassle to know the format you need and more interesting makes the code easier to port across different DB backend.

Sorry if anything like that exists already, did a search and nothing came up.

I don't think that this exists already. At least, i didn't found it too.

Great idea, but it could be better that DB adapters will accept Zend\_Date objects, and adding a parameter for queries to return Zend\_Date objects instead of plane dates?

I'm running into the same _problem_. I was using _incorrectly_ using Zend\_Date::ISO\_8601 (eg. '2011-07-29T00:00:00+02:00') which is working fine with MySQL 5.5 but not with MySQL 5.0 (don't support the timezone part in a SELECT statement).

If find the idea to add a concept of Zend\_Date into Zend\_Db quite useful.

The Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract could easily be adapted as follows (but all {Zend\_Db adapters would need to be updated too):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    abstract class Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
    {
        /**
         * Set date column Zend_Date format
         * 
         * @param string $format
         * 
         * @return void
         * 
         * @see Zend_Date
         */
        abstract public function setDateFormat($format);
        
        /**
         * Set datetime column Zend_Date format
         * 
         * @param string $format
         * 
         * @return void
         * 
         * @see Zend_Date
         */
        abstract public function setDateTimeFormat($format);
        
        /**
         * Get date column Zend_Date format
         * 
         * @return string
         * 
         * @see Zend_Date
         */
        abstract public function getDateFormat($format);
        
        /**
         * Get datetime column Zend_Date format
         * 
         * @return string
         * 
         * @see Zend_Date
         */
        abstract public function getDateTimeFormat($format);
    }
    {
