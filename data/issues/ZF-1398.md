### Description

The default implementation of the query() method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract performs a prepare() on every SQL statement.

Some SQL statements are incompatible with prepare(). This varies by RDBMS brand and client API design, but there are usually some such statements.

For example, MySQL does not support preparing DDL or SHOW statements.

This is a feature request to add some method to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract to execute a SQL statement without performing a prepare(). In the case of PDO adapters, this is the exec() method of the underlying PDO object. But other database extensions have different methods to achieve this goal.

Non-prepared statements are also important for MySQL because the MySQL Query Cache feature cannot cache prepared statements.

Yeah, just read that please : [http://netevil.org/node.php/…](http://netevil.org/node.php?uuid=444a6017-0548-2459-2943-44a601714d58)

I don't know if that bug has already been reported, but i met it on RC1.0 under a linux server. The query was

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    using PDO under Mysql(4.1) and Linux throws an exception 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2030 This command is not supported in
    the prepared statement protocol yet' in {file}
    
    The only way to fix it was to modify the Zend/Db/Adapter/PdoAbstract.php by adding 

There is no way to change that behavior other than modify it manually in the framework source. And as said here : there is no was to prevent adapter from using prepared statements...

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Of course I only found this issue after opening another one. Can someone mark ZF-4767 as duplicate. Apologies for the extra work.

Also, what's the status of this issue? I'd like to see it fixed soon. :-)

I will evaluate this with the next 2 weeks.

This is still a blocker for me.

Below is some code which I started using in some of my projects to use unprepared queries and to utilize the query cache to a certain extend. The \_\_call() is a way to debug this and to find methods I didn't cover yet.

This is not final but a work in progress and an idea. I could extend it, etc. if I get some feedback here.

And here is some code demonstrating usage:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    set_include_path('.:' . dirname(__FILE__) . '/trunk/library');
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Db.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Select.php';
    
    try {
        $db = Zend_Db::factory(
            'Mysqli',
            array(
                'username' => 'root',
                'password' => '',
                'host'     => 'localhost',
                'dbname'   => 'mysql'
            )
        );
        $db->usePrepared(true);
    
        $select = $db->select();
        $select->from('user', array('Host', 'User'));
    
        var_dump($db->fetchAssoc($select));
    
    
        $db->usePrepared(false);
    
        $select->reset();
        $select = $db->select();
        $select->from('user', array('Host', 'User'));
    
        var_dump($db->fetchAssoc($select));
    
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        die($e->getMessage());
    }


I briefly ran tests and it didn't break anything, but no guarantees. ;-) I also cloned the tests for the Mysqli driver and ran them with usePrepared() and it worked. This is just an idea.

The usePrepared() call is more or less an idea to change the behaviour on run time. I also envision a config option which you can pass in with a Zend\_Config object or an array.

I think by default this should be disabled but that would break BC so I guess I could live with it the other way around too. Haven't made up my mind up though, I just needed to get rid off prepared queries.

 

 

Posted by Benjamin Eberlei (beberlei) on 2009-02-26T14:26:08.000+0000

The fix looks good, by default i would enable the preparing of statements and allow to pass a config value to disable it.

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-07-17T08:48:06.000+0000

Why is there the requirement that non-preparable queries must go through query?

Why not add a method called execute() ? OR- why not simply use the Statement? or the getConnection()?

 

 

Posted by Josh Butts (jimbojsb) on 2009-08-17T11:16:20.000+0000

I agree that this should be possible to do, but don't necessary agree with the API implementation outlined in the patch above

 

 

Posted by Pieter Kokx (kokx) on 2010-02-18T11:21:39.000+0000

I attached a patch for this issue. It does only contain a fix for PDO adapters yet, other adapters will fail because there is an abstract function missing.

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2011-11-17T02:08:06.000+0000

This issue is specifically mentioned in the Zend\\Db RFC for ZFv2. However, is this something which should be fixed in ZFv1 as well?

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2012-05-06T13:02:40.000+0000

This won't be fixed in ZFv1
