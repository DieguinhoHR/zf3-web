### Description

When using Zend\_Http\_Client to POST data to a specified URL, the POST data is not populated correctly. Looking at the code, it should work according to my (limited) knowledge of HTTP. But it doesn't seem to work.

I've tested this with a setup of PHP 5.1.4 with the following configure:

'./configure' '--with-xml' '--with-xslt' '--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs' '--with-curl' '--with-mysql=/storage/mysql' '--enable-mbstring' '--enable-sockets' '--enable-pdo' '--with-pdo-mysql=/storage/mysql'

on Apache/2.0.55 (Unix)

Test scripts with which I can reproduce this are attached as files. Server script (server.php) always gives an empty array when doing print\_r($\_POST).

Additional info:

The request itself is being received by the receiving script. The headers arrive as they should. I added an extra header, and this is being displayed by the server.php script. The Content-length header contains the right amount for the test data being sent. Echo-ing the data inside Zend\_Http\_Client also displays that the data is correct when it is being sent.

For some reason though, the actual body of the POST message is not being recognized and parsed as $\_POST data.

On a hunch, I just tried to see what are the contents of $HTTP\_RAW\_POST\_DATA and this one is actually being filled. If this is a feature, then we need to document it I think. If this is a bug, we should fix it ;)

I didn't test, but I'd bet this is because you do not set a 'Content-type' header in the request. Please try to set an extra header: 'Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and see what happens.

In the new HTTP client (incubator) this is handeled automatically. If this is the case, I see no point in fixing the old client.

Let me know how it goes.

Wonderful, that indeed solves the issue. My knowledge of HTTP is clearly not good enough ;)
