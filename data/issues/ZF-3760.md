ZF-3760: Incorrect query being used with PostgreSQL, Zend\_Db\_Select and order by
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-25T15:12:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-07-28T08:10:44.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Code:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $select = $table->select()->from($table)->order('mycolumn asc');
    $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($select);


Profiler shows the following query being used:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS zend_paginator_row_count FROM "table" ORDER BY "mycolumn" asc


... which results in a grouping error, as expected.

Attaching a diff for Zend/Paginator/Adapter/DbSelect.php that fixed my problem.
