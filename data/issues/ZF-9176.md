It is not possible to set options such as the formatter via the config and Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Log. The factory function accepts the parameter but ignores it, the constructor does not have any support to pass in options or setting them.

Benoit -- patch looks good. I think this warrants merging to the 1.11 release branch, as it improves current capabilities.
