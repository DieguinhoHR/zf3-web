### Description

Zend\_Vew should to support layouts (like in RoR, CakePHP etc.)

My proposal is to create Zend\_View::registerParentScript($view, $contentVariableName);

$view is script file used as a layout. $contentVariableName is name of variable that will be used as a holder of rendered child scripts.

Additional methods: Zend\_View::isParentViewRegistered() // boolean Zend\_View::getContentVariableName(); // string etc.

If it does not fit Zend Framework View philosphy, maybe it there is a place to implement that in Zend\_Controller\_Action::initView()?

??If it does not fit Zend Framework View philosphy, maybe it there is a place to implement that in Zend\_Controller\_Action::initView()???

Maybe I wrote that too fast.

But this is my implementation of what I want:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function render($action = null, $name = null, $noController = false)
        {
            if (null === $action) {
                $action = $this->getRequest()->getActionName();
            } elseif (!is_string($action)) {
                throw new Zend_Controller_Exception('Invalid action specifier for view render');
            }
    
            $view   = $this->initView();
            $script = $action . '.' . $this->viewSuffix;
    
            if (!$noController) {
                $script = $this->getRequest()->getControllerName() . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $script;
            }
            $layout = $this->getBasePath() . 'layout' . $this->viewSuffix;
            if (file_exists($layout) {
                /* $content_for_layout is equivalent of mentioned
                    in my first post $contentVariableName */
                $view->content_for_layout = $view->render($script);
                $script = $layout;
            };
            $this->getResponse()->appendBody(
                $view->render($script),
                $name
            );
        }

The Zend\_Layout proposal was accepted, and an implementation exists in the incubator at this time. Please test and provide feedback on the fw-mvc list.

Zend\_Layout is scheduled for release with the 1.1.0 release.
