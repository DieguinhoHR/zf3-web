### Description

Hi,

I wonder if it is possible (or better: expected) to include a helper method like getDecodedHeader() or something similar inside Zend\_Mail\_Part? The alternative may be a specific method inside Zend\_Mime\_Decode.

The use case is pretty simple:

I'm reading mail, fetching my message and getting (e.g.) subject.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $subject = $message->subject;


The thing I'm getting inside $subject at this moment is often something like

=?UTF-8?B?some\_base64\_enc\_string?= or =?ISO-8859-2?Q?qp\_encoded\_string?=

The "from" field can look also like: =?ISO-8859-2?Q?qp\_encoded\_sender\_name?= [person@server.com](mailto:person@server.com)

These type of encodings are common among messages from (and to) polish servers.

I read mails quite often and the need to write my own extensions to handle this is quite frustrating.

I can post some code if someone replies me, that the ZF team finds it useful. I am not sure about the RFC and your attitude towards it.

Feel free to post some questions, I will do my best to answer them.

Yours, Adam Kopeć [adam.kopec@gmail.com](mailto:adam.kopec@gmail.com)
