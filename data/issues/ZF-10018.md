### Description

Hello,

I have a script on my server which is continually running.

The script initially uses Zend\_Service\_Twitter to poll the latest tweet from a hundred or so users. Once a complete pass of users is made, the script sleeps for 5 minutes then starts again.

The problem is every 4-5 days the script crashes with the following error: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20160 bytes) in /usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework-latest/Zend/Validate/Hostname.php on line 547

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    539. /**
    540.  * Match against IDN hostnames
    541.  * Note: Keep label regex short to avoid issues with long patterns when matching IDN hostnames
    542.  * @see Zend_Validate_Hostname_Interface
    543.  */
    544. $regexChars = array(0 => '/^[a-z0-9\x2d]{1,63}$/i');
    545. if ($this->_options['idn'] &&  isset($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)])) {
    546.     if (is_string($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)])) {
    547.         $regexChars += include($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)]);
    548.     } else {
    549.         $regexChars += $this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)];
    550.     }
    551. }

Closing as non-issue

When creating scripts which run multiple days, you need to be carefull what you are coding.

The problem is that somewhere in your code, you are not erasing unused memory. So it gets bigger and bigger.

Why you are getting the memory exhaustment at Hostname is simply because of the include clause.

$regexChars is emptied latest at every call of isValid when you do no unset within your code. Dependent on the used idn the related idn file is included. When using COM, JP or some other Idns, Hostname adds the file to the regex to use. These files are 1-2k big.

There is no way to change this behaviour as Hostname must know which chars are accepted by the used Idn.
