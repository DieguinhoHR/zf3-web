### Description

After trying to understand the theory of operation and internal details about Zend\_Tool, I've seen that Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_ProjectProvider doesn't allows usage of "--pretend" flag to see what will be created. After looking on the source code, I've noticed that this class doens't implement "Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Provider\_Pretendable" wich is necessary to enabled "--pretend" flag.

Including a patch (from trunk at rev 24246) to enable "--pretend" flag to be used on Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_ProjectProvider, just as intended:

zf --pretend create project-provider foo

I know this is a minor fix, but how can I see this patch integrated to the framework?
