ZF-12214: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File - improve error messages for cache\_dir
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File can't use specified directory, it throws an exception with message "cache\_dir must be a directory". I think it would be much better if it said, which path is not directory. (Just try to Google "cache\_dir must be a directory").

Attached patch changes that behaviour - the message is now ??"Message: cache\_dir "./tmp/" must be a directory"??
