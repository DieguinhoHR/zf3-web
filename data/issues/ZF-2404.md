### Description

In Zend\_Date constructor Zend\_Date::now() is calling without $locale. (line 184)

If your browser doesn't send a HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE header and you don't pass date to Zend\_Date then Zend\_Locale will raise an exception "Autodetection of Locale has been failed!".

This is only the case

- If the browser does not send the LANGUAGE Header
- And you have not set a default locale within Zend\_Locale or your bootstrap file
- And your Environment does not provide a locale
- And you are using a release below 7357

Already fixed through ZF pre-set default locale within Zend\_Locale.
