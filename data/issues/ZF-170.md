Yes, this is on my TODO list, although someone else is welcome to implement it. :-)

Can you give some use case examples for how you'd like to use this feature?

Patch needs to be applied to svn, but is resolved.

Reopening issue so that it can be addressed in SVN and resolved post-0.6.0

Zend\_Filter\_Input no longer exists, but certainly the use case of mapping filter and validation chains to data containers should be supported nicely. I would encourage writing a proposal to illustrate the ideas, explore use cases, and outline possible solutions.
