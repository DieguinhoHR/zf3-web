### Description

Following the tutorial the example only shows a solution for SQLite. Adapting the tutorial to attempt to work with MySQL instead I came up with an exception "Message: No adapter found for Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Guestbook".

I am unsure as to whether or not this affects the sqlite version as well or not. I will test that and return with my finding.

I believe there should be some alternatives in the area as far as the db options go. I don't think too many production applications will be using sqlite.

It was a line ending issue.

We use SQLite in the quickstart to keep it self-contained and simple to get up-and-running so that developers can experiment with the framework; it is not intended as a recommendation for SQLite, as choice of database will be very project and organization specific.

Based on your comment, I'll now close the issue.
