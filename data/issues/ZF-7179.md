### Description

I am experiencing this issue with Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle, but I think it will apply to all adapters because the error is in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract.

I think that Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quote() does not work for any value where the type is Zend\_Db::FLOAT\_TYPE and the value has more digits/characters than the maximum for a float on the platform.

In my case, I am accessing an Oracle database that uses a NUMBER(38) column to store the primary key. This column typically contains a 36 digit number, e.g. 555761052034529007487149626225672131. When this value is passed to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quote(), e.g. from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findDependentRowset(), it evaluates as type Zend\_Db::FLOAT\_TYPE, and quote() makes sure it is safe using:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
                    case Zend_Db::FLOAT_TYPE: // float or decimal
                        $quotedValue = sprintf('%F', $value);


Unfortunately, sprintf('%F', 555761052034529007487149626225672131) returns 555761052034529022312814055230799872.000000 rather than 555761052034529007487149626225672131.000000 and so this is the value returned by quote(), which is incorrect.

The result is correct to 16 significant places, which would make sense if floats are a 64bit decimal.

Given that we are not trying to do any arithmetic with the value, just to make it safe, it could be fixed by replacing the call to sprintf with a preg\_match() in the same way that is done for Zend\_Db::BIGINT\_TYPE, e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    case Zend_Db::BIGINT_TYPE: // 64-bit integer
                        // ANSI SQL-style hex literals (e.g. x'[\dA-F]+')
                        // are not supported here, because these are string
                        // literals, not numeric literals.
                        if (preg_match('/^(
                              [+-]?                  # optional sign
                              (?:
                                0[Xx][\da-fA-F]+     # ODBC-style hexadecimal
                                |\d+                 # decimal or octal, or MySQL ZEROFILL decimal
                                (?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?    # optional exponent on decimals or octals
                              )
                            )/x',
                            (string) $value, $matches)) {
                            $quotedValue = $matches[1];
                        }
                        break;


In case it makes a difference, the server is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
