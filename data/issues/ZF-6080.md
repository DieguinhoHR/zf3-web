### Description

I use Zend\_Translate in conjunction with Zend\_Form (translation works, field's labels are correctly translated). I also set default FormErrors as a form decorator.

The problem is that FormErrors decorator don't translate retreived field labels in the summary, while error descriptions are correctly translated.

I changed FormErrors.php, located in _zend\_library_\\Form\\Decorator\\, in this way:

 
       if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
            $label = $translator->translate($label);
        }


above lines of code were added to the method: public function renderLabel(Zend\_Form\_Element $element, Zend\_View\_Interface $view) So method become like this:

 
    public function renderLabel(Zend_Form_Element $element, Zend_View_Interface $view)
    {
        $label = $element->getLabel();
        if (empty($label)) {
            $label = $element->getName();
        }
    
    if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
            $label = $translator->translate($label);
        }
    
        return $this->getMarkupElementLabelStart()
             . $view->escape($label)
             . $this->getMarkupElementLabelEnd();
    }


Now, fields' labels in error summary are translated!
