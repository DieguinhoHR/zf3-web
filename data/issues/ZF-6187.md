### Description

The regex for method name validation in "Zend\_Json\_Server\_Request" schould look like "protected $_methodRegex = '/^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]_$/i';" instead of "protected $_methodRegex = '/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]_$/i';" in order to support dotted namespaces, which are supported by some JSON-RPC-Clients for JavaScript yet.
