### Description

From Reference Guide section 37.2.1. Common page features:

{quote} visible | bool | TRUE | Whether page should be visible for the user, or just be a part of the structure. Invisible pages are skipped by view helpers. {quote}

I tried to take advantage of this property, adding the following element in the navigation xml file

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ...
        Usuários
            Clique para visualizar os usuários registrados.usersindexuserRegistrar usuário
                    Clique para registrar um novo usuário.usersnewuserEditar usuário
                    Clique para editar um usuário.usersedituser
                    *false*
                
    ...


but looks like this property isn't properly handled by navigation helpers.

My call for sub menu rendering is as follows:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php echo $this->navigation()->menu()->setOnlyActiveBranch(true)
                                          ->setRenderParents(false)
                                          ->setRenderInvisible(false) ?>


Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu doesn't seems to check which a page is visible or not before rendering. A look in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Helper interface shown that there is a method called setRenderInvisible and this is honored by the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract class but doesn't seems to be used in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu component. A search for the 'visible' string in the component's source code don't return anything.

To help to understand the issue, I followed the navigation helper rendering flow:

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation helpers proxy to the appropriated helper, menu in this case;
===========================================================================================

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu return itself;
===================================================

setOnlyActiveBranch() is called;
================================

The $\_onlyActiveBranch is defined;
===================================

setRenderParents() is called;
=============================

The $\_renderParents is defined;
================================

setRenderInvisible() is called from Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract;
===================================================================================

The $\_renderInvisible is defined;
==================================

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu calls \_\_toString() - inherited from Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract;
==========================================================================================================================

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu calls render() - also inherited from Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract;
=========================================================================================================================

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu calls renderMenu - no partial specified;
=============================================================================

\_renderDeepestMenu() is called - as onlyActiveBranch is true and renderParents is false. The $\_renderInvisible is not used;
=============================================================================================================================

Maybe there is missing additional check for the visible property before rendering pages.

I have the same problem as you, Bruno. I found that the "visible" tag is not being set properly by the Zend\_Navigation\_xyz class(es). Working through the code systematically resulted in reaching the setVisible() method under Zend\_Navigation\_Page, which is expected. What was not expected, however, was that the method was designed as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setVisible($visible = true)
    {
        $this->_visible = (bool) $visible;
    
        return $this;
    }


The page properties, especially if read from a config INI/XML file, are usually in the form of strings. The boolean value of a string that isn't empty and isn't "0" is true. Thus, anytime you tried to set a page invisible via a string representation for false (i.e. "false" or "FALSE"), the function sets the property to true since this is the value returned when type-casting a non-null, non-empty, non-zero string to a boolean value.

Here's the fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setVisible($visible = true)
    {
        if (is_string($visible) &&
            (strtolower($visible) == 'false' || !((bool)$visible))
        {
            $this->_visible = false;
        }
        else
        {
            $this->_visible = (bool) $visible;
        }
    
        return $this;
    }

Very good, at the first impression your solution is fine.

Did you test this solution in a running application? Were you able to hide the pages by setting the visible property for false?

I will make some tests as soon as possible.

Thanks :)

@Bruno In my web application I was trying to hide certain links in my navigation menu from showing, but I couldn't remove the links from my XML file completely because I wanted navigation->breadcrumbs() to still function properly for these pages.

So, yes, I am using the code posted above and so far I haven't run into any issues. Of course, I haven't tested the code incessantly for input validation purposes, but assuming you type 0, 1, false, or true within the tags in your INI/XML file nothing should break. I might have to go through the Page.php file to ensure that other setter methods don't have bugs either.
