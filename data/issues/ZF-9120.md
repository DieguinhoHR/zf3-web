ZF-9120: would be nice to have Zend\_Date::factory() method

### Description

Would be nice to have Zend\_Date::factory() method, that will be identical to \_\_construct(), but will work as static factory method. For example:

$date = new Zend\_Date('10/03/2010'); echo $date->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH);

Would look much nicer and compact with this:

echo Zend\_Date::factory('10/03/2010')->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH);

There is no difference to {quote} print new Zend\_Date('10/03/2010')->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH); {quote}

As you can have multiple instances of this object the factory pattern is not necessary.

such syntax is not allowed in PHP

maybe a parameter to now() would help? for example:

echo Zend\_Date::now('10/03/2010')->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH);

what do you think?

I would rather prefer the factory method then. Because, for me, now will return the current Zend\_Date, and I won't think that I would pass a param to now() to receive another date. And also, the factory method could have all the params of Zend\_Date constructor.

Like that, we could do

Zend\_Date::factory('2010/01/01', 'yyyy/dd/MM', $locale)->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH);

etc

My 2 cents,

I still see no reason to add what's already working into a class which will be completly changed in the next release.

Actually it simply works with:

echo Zend\_Date::now()->set('2010/01/01', 'yyyy/dd/MM', $locale)->get(Zend\_Date::MONTH);

Additionally a date filter is already accepted and will be added with the next minor release which itself simplifies the handling much more.

How exactly I can create an object and get its string value in one command? Could you please give a code example? Thanks.
