### Description

If we want to set the option features with the method setOptions(), we must use the key "featues" instead of the right word "features".

I updated the method testSetOptions() for this case, and added a test for the last option "wsdl\_cache" forgotten.

I do not know if you prefer to deprecate the key "featues" with a notice instead of deleting in order to not break compatibility.

Fixed in r22222!

Case "featues" is still available to not break backward compatibility.
