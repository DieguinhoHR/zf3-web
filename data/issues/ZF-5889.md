ZF-5889: getFileSize and getFileMimeType non-existant?
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-02-26T04:05:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-17T11:26:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

Based on the documentation: {quote} $upload = new Zend\_File\_Transfer(); $upload->receive();

// Returns the sizes from all files as array if more than one file was uploaded $size = $upload->getFileSize(); {quote}

Firstly, using 'Zend\_File\_Transfer(); causes an exception: Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception: Implementation in progress ... Transfer.php, So if you use: {quote} $upload = new Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http(); $upload->receive();

// Returns the sizes from all files as array if more than one file was uploaded $size = $upload->getFileSize(); {quote}

It throws the error:

bq.Call to undefined method Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::getFileSize()

And likewise: {quote} $upload = new Zend\_File\_Transfer(); $upload->receive();

$mime = $upload->getMimeType(); {quote} It throws the error: {quote} Call to undefined method Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::getFileMimeType() {quote}

Based on the documentation you are referring to:

{quote} Limitation The current implementation of Zend\_File\_Transfer is limited to HTTP Post Uploads. Other adapters supporting downloads and other protocols will be added in future releases. Unimplemented methods will throw an exception. For now, you should use Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http directly. As soon as there are multiple adapters available you can use a common interface. {quote}

And also the example in the manual reads:

{quote} $adapter = new Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http();$adapter->setDestination('C:\\temp');if (!$adapter->receive()) { $messages = $adapter->getMessages(); echo implode("\\n", $messages);} {quote}

Hi thomas,

christian clearly stated a still existing error, the documentated methods getFileSize and getMimeType do _NOT_ exists.

Please look into it.

Thanks, Littlex :)

The methods getFileSize and getMimeType, as stated in the documentation, do not exist.

They exist within Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract since r13822 and r13935.

As we are not allowed to add new functionality within a mini-release they will be released with the next minor release as all new functionalities.

So the only real failure I see it a false assignment of the fix release.

As side note: The problem of the manual itself is part of a new proposal which I am working on with Mickael.

But this has nothing to do with this issue.
