Sorting data structures is not a work which should be done by Zend\_Locale.

Hm, you're right. I thought it is because the order of sorting depends on the current locale. But I agree with you.

Is there a component where to put it into? e.g. Zend\_Filter?

The only thing Zend\_Locale can provide is the information about collation. But as this ruleset has a size of about 2MB we decided not to support for now.

In my opinion Zend\_Filter is not the right component to sort data structures. Actually there is no component as most things are already possible using native php. New components have to be proposed (wiki).

Issue requests are the wrong way for completly new components.

Closing as won't fix. Sorting of data structures is not Zend\_Locale's target.
