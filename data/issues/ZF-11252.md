### Description

I use Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu, this helper allows url's to be null, it then creates a span instead of a href.

My personal router, based on Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract has a assemble method that gives back null for pages that do not have an url.

Now the bug occures, the Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite assemble method always appends the baseurl and a slash

It can be fixed as follows.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!preg_match('|^[a-z]+://|', $url)) {
        $url = rtrim($this->getFrontController()->getBaseUrl(), '/') . '/' . $url;
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($url !== null && !preg_match('|^[a-z]+://|', $url)) {
        $url = rtrim($this->getFrontController()->getBaseUrl(), '/') . '/' . $url;
    }


It took me quitte some time to find out where the / came from. I hope you can fix this for future releases, so other people do not have to find this needle in the haystack ;-)

The rewrite router is supposed to work with URLs, and it doesn't know about the term "pages". Thus a route is _always_ expected to return a URL.

By default the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu uses the assemble method of the router. Some 'navigation items' don't have a url and therefore my router returns null as url (in the assemble method).

Maybe it is not clear to me, but as far as I can see, this can be easily fixed by only adding _$url !== null &&_
