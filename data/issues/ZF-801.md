### Description

If we restrict Zend\_Auth to providing for authenticating HTTP requests to the application, then we need only one instance of the authentication object per PHP execution space. It is best for the component design that Zend\_Auth focus on supporting the generalized use case of authenticating the HTTP request against the web application. All things considered, Zend\_Auth is a good candidate for implementing the Singleton pattern, since only one instance is needed per request. Of course, the one instance could bind to any of various authentication adapters included with Zend\_Auth or to a custom adapter written by the user.

By implementing the Singleton pattern, there is a side benefit of inherently providing global access to the object instance.

Instead of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth = new Zend_Auth(...);


We would have:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance();

Also keep in mind that in addition to binding to different Auth Adapters, it can be bound to different Storage Mechanisms.. With that in mind, if component A and component B really want to maintain different authentication identities (extreme edge case), they can both do so within the same session, simply by using a different namespace in the ZendSession storage type adapter.

getInstance (like Zend\_Contoller) should be complemented with a resetInstance().

Also related to storage is [ZF-804]
