### Description

It's been decided to rename Zend\_Application\_Resource\_CacheManager to Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Cache to be more in line with other resource plugins. E.g., the Dojo resource plugin only configures the dojo view helper, the Mail Resource plugin basically only configures the MailTransport, the db adapter only configures a specific adapter, etc...

This has been reverted back to Cachemanager, can we expect it to remain like this or?

Yes. It turned out that cachemanager was better after all.
