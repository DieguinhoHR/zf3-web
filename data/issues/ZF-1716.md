ZF-1716: Named parameters pattern does not match PDO
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-07-12T19:12:49.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:32:37.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.1 (30/Jul/07)

### Description

In the PHP source, in ext/pdo/pdo\_sql\_parser.re, the pattern for named bound parameters is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        BINDCHR     = [:][a-zA-Z0-9_]+;


But in Zend\_Db\_Statement::\_parseParameters(), the regular expression is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            /(\?|\:[a-z_]+)/


Please expand the regular expression in Zend\_Db\_Statement to be compatible with that used by PDO.

To simplify the pattern, just use the "word" metasequence:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /(\?|\:\w+)/
