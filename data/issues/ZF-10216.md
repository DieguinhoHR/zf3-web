### Description

A user could assume that Zend\_Filter\_Word\_CamelCaseToUnderscore is the opposite of Zend\_Filter\_Word\_UnderscoreToCamelCase.

The result instead could be different due to letter casing, adding to the documentation an example like the following could be helpful.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
         first_name
     
              => Zend_Filter_Word_UnderscoreToCamelCase 
    
                   =>FirstName
    
                         => Zend_Filter_Word_CamelCaseToUnderscore 
    
                                => First_Name
