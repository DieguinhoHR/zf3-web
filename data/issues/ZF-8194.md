### Description

I want to validate a date that's in the ISO\_8601 format, but unfortunately, zend\_date::isDate() doesn't seem to support that (yet).

Closing as Non-Issue.

ISO\_8601 is detected in the format which is also used by PHP's ISO constant.

A "free" detection like described here would negotate this validator and will therefor not be implemented.
