### Description

Guys, I am not quite sure but I think I got a problem with Zend Framework and PHP 5.3. I am using Ubuntu 10.4 system and PHP 5.3 with mod\_rewrite, working for the normal way of rewriting but when I run some projects with Zend Framework even the example project from the Quick start, when I click the Guest book link I get the following error

Not Found

The requested URL /Zend/htdocs/public/guestbook/ was not found on this server. Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80

It seems that it cannot rewrite the URL. Can you check if this is a bug, please?

If this is a bug it can appear under other Operating systems too. I have no idea.

This is not a bug.

Having said that, probably mod\_rewrite isn't enabled, or allowoverride has the wrong parameters set. Please seek support through the appropriate support channels; mailinglists, forums, or irc (<http://www.zftalk.com>). Good luck.
