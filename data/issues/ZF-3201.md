### Description

Can any one provide information regarding Zend\_search\_Lucene. i have files in my computer. My web request should first make index from this files and when typing any keyword, it should come with the search results. I am getting difficulty how to make such index that takes computer files and then search the keyword from it. The files are of PDF and Doc Ones.

I have heard about Zend\_Search\_Lucene thing but do not know how to use this feature.
