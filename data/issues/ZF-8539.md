### Description

When calling the api with a "ResponseGroup=large", the result send us an object "Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_CustomerReview" with a "customerId".

If you look at the result , there is an object which is not translated by the framework "Reviewer"

12009-12-07Great − The books were a Christmas gift. I received them the DAY AFTER I ordered. Great, brand new and fast!

This evolution consist in adding an object Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Reviewer in order to have all the information about a given comment in AWS.

Thanks in advance
