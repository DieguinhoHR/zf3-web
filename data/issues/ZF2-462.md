ZF2-462: Throws exception when trying to generate bcrypt

### Description

Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt throws exception "Error during the bcrypt generation" when "create" method is called. I work with Zend Server that uses version "5.3.8-ZS5.5.0" of PHP. I think maybe the wrong salt prefix ($2y$) is selected because the exception is not thrown if I force the code to use "$2a$" as prefix.

This is odd because the "$2y$" prefix should be used instead of "$2a$" starting from PHP 5.3.7+ (for more details: [http://www.php.net/security/crypt\_blowfish.php](http://www.php.net/security/crypt_blowfish.php)). Can you show me the snippet code that you are trying to execute?

I use the ZfcUser module of Evan Coury that provide authentication feature. The "$hash" variable of \\Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt::create method has always a length of 13.
