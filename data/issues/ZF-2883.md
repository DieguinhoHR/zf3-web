### Description

If you have a display group within a sub form, the elements contained by the display group do not get namespaced within the rendered form correctly, which leads to issues during form submission.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    $subForm->setLegend('Attributes');
    
    $subForm->addElement('text', 'foo')
            ->addElement('text', 'bar')
            ->addDisplayGroup(array('foo', 'bar'), 'foobar');
    
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addSubForm($subForm, 'attributes');
    echo $form->render(new Zend_View());


One would expect the following HTML:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    


            Attributes


                        
                        
                        
                    
                
        

But the following is actually received:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    


            Attributes

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.
