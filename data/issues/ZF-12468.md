ZF-12468: Zend\_Soap\_Client has no 'exceptions' flag.

### Description

The Zend\_Soap\_Client class does not allow the SoapClient option 'exceptions' to be changed. Further to this, it doesn't actually enable it by default, meaning that if there's a SoapFault then a fatal error is thrown.

Could you provide a working example of what you mean?

Also, if you could sign the CLA ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)) and provide a patch, I'm happy to review it.

Sure, which version should I create the patch for? It affects ZF2 as well, although the CLA says it's not needed for ZF2.

For ZF2, you don't need a CLA - just follow the guidelines at <http://bit.ly/zf2git>

For ZF1, you do need to sign a CLA and send to Zend. Once you've done that, you should provide a patch file against trunk ([http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/))
