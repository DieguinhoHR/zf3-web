ZF-1962: Simple Http Digest Adapter from docs is not working on a subdomain

### Description

I've tried the simple example from the docs that shows a basic usage example of the Http Digest Adapter. For the login data i used the ones from the unittest so i can be shure i've made nothing wrong.

The thing is i never got a successful login attemp, after a long time trying i setup my local apache and it worked. Now i think this was because i was using it on a subdomain.

For the current project i've switched to the form adapter because i'm a bit in a hurry, so i'll give a more detailed error description when i've finished the project (few days).

I just moved last weekend, and have just gotten Internet access yesterday. I'll try to take a look at this in the coming week. Sorry for the late response!

I tested this adapter under a subdomain, and was unable to reproduce the issue. It worked fine for me, using both basic and digest authentication.

To help me get to the root of the problem, would be willing to provide some more information? Show me the complete code you used to set up and initialize the adapter, including the resolvers, the contents of the resolver password files (obviously, you should substitute any passwords as needed), and a log of all the request and response headers between the browser and your Apache during the login process. This will help me determine exactly where the problem is occurring.

maintenance closing, since no votes and watches are for this issue and no reproduce code was provided, this seems to be a non issue.
