ZF-6240: Add an element that show absolute values to Console adapter

### Description

Add an element that show absolute values to the Console adapter. Like the percent element, but with the absolute values, currentValue / maxValue. Example: 999 / 14000

This would be an improvement for a progress bar with large values, for example we have a process with about 50.000 steps.

Here is are the diffs for the modified Zend\_Progress\_Adapter\_Console, and the adapter's test. It allows absolute value elements.

Please mind - inside \_calculateBarWidth() the max-calue is missing, which is needed for calculating the absolute elements width. It is hardcoded to 9 right now, this should be fixed by the maintainer.

Another nice to have would be a string-template for the absolute string, right now it's "$currentValue / $maxValue". Example: 53 / 150
