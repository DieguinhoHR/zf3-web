### Description

There is no need to use reflection to iterate over an object's properties

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $reflection = new ReflectionObject($this);
    foreach ($reflection->getProperties() as $property) {
      $name = $property->getName();
      switch ($name) {
        ...


could be simply changed to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($this as $name => $value) {
      switch ($name) {
        ...


Another way is to iterate over get\_object\_vars($this), but foreach($this) work for objects the same way as for arrays.

Btw. the curly brackets in $this->{$name} (used in the case parts) are useless. $name isn't a concatenated variable name (like $this->{'\_' . $name}) or ambiguous as sometimes in double qouted strings (like "foo$namebar" -> "foo{$name}bar").

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.

These are simply stylistic differences. Reflection is the PHP 5 way of doing class and object introspection. Using the curly braces is mainly to highlight the fact that dynamic property referencing is occurring.

Won't fix; simply coding style differences.
