As for now, the code coverage report is not very well filled out.

There are several problems as "closing tags marked unused" or "function headers marked unused". These issues are known and will maybe worked around in future version of PHPunit.

A cverage of 100% is for now not possible.

Thanks for the report - for now, I'll mark the issue as unscheduled so that it does not become a blocker for 0.2.0.

We're not going to include the coverage reports in the ZF distribution, but we have plans to publish test coverage reports online soon.
