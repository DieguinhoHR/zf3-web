### Description

Hi all!

In view helper FormFile on line 52 \_\_invoke prototype:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __invoke($name, $attribs = null)


But file decorator call this method (with proxy of course) with 3 arguments:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $markup[] = $view->formFile($name, null, $attribs);


This leads to the loss of an element's attributes.

Files: - Zend/Form/Decorator/File.php:127 - Zend/Form/Decorator/File.php:130 - Zend/Form/Decorator/FormFile.php:52 in f4e41abad2

Congratulations with the first beta!
