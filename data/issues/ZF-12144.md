### Description

_Symptom_: file upload doesn't work on Windows, file count validator complains about having 2 files instead of 1, while only 1 file is uploaded.

_Reason_: Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count::\_files has two records: 1) C:\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\filename.ext 2) C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP\\filename.ext

_Fix_ for /Zend/Validate/File/Count.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function addFile($file)
        {
            if (is_string($file)) {
                $file = array($file);
            }
    
            if (is_array($file)) {
                foreach ($file as $name) {
                    if (empty($name))
                        continue;
                    $realpath = realpath($name);  // use realpath so that case-sensitivity is not an issue
                    if (!isset($this->_files[$realpath])) {
                        $this->_files[$realpath] = $realpath;
                    }
                }
            }
    
            return $this;
        }

Hi, I can confirm this patch also resolves the double count issue on Windows where an uploaded path has potential for a shortened alias, such as this (when run as an Apache module as a system service, using system service temp dir) :

C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\infoschema-query.png C:\\Windows\\SERVIC~2\\NETWOR~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\infoschema-query.png

In this case, it looks like the path is added twice in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::isValid()
