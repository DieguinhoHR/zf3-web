### Description

Hi,

I'm using a view (MVC setup) compounded of : - a dijit.Tooltip div rendered using pure html markup (since there is no Zend View helper for this at the moment) - a Zend\_Dojo\_Form with some Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element : Button, ValidationTextBox, etc. - a single dijit.form.ValidationTextBox rendered with pure html (for testing purpose)

While rendering this view in a browser (FF3) : - none of the form elements gets its html template applied. Firebug shows that requests are made to retrieve javascript modules for each element (ValidationTextBox.js, ComboBox.js), but I CAN'T see any request concerning their templates (ValidationTextBox.html, ComboBox.html) - the single dijit.form.ValidationTextBox is correctly rendered

If I delete the tooltip div, everything is rendered correctly and Firebug shows that requests are made to retrieve widgets html templates.

Dojo is 1.3.1

I would be happy to provide more informations if needed.

Could you please verify is this still an issue? Also if you could provide the minimum code needed to reproduce the issue that'd be great!

Thanks!
