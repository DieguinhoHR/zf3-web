### Description

When using fwrite, the result should be tested against the false boolean value.

Currently in Zend/Log/Writer/Stream.php it is tested as ! @fwrite() which is true when the fwrite was called with an empty string. When called with an empty string, 0 bytes are written and it is the normal behaviour.

Here is the trivial patch:
