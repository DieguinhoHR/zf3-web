### Description

When setting the encoding on a message to utf8 causes spaces to be removed (possibly additional other side effects are present)

$message = new \\Zend\\Mail\\Message(); $message->setEncoding("UTF-8"); $message->setSubject("Some text with spaces"); $transport = new \\Zend\\Mail\\Transport\\Sendmail(); $transport->send($message);

Resulting Header Subject: Sometextwithspaces

Expected Header Subject: Some text with spaces
