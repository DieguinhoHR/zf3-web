ZF-8159: Zend\_Config\_Ini doesn't load multiple sections correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-27T05:59:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-19T12:08:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If you pass an array of sections to Zend\_Config\_Ini the sections are merged using array\_merge(). This is a problem when you are using the config to create a Zend\_Form, as all the elements are under the "elements" key, so when they are merged you end up with only the elements from one of the sections.

Example: test.ini file

 
    <pre class="literal">
    [first]
    user.login.elements.username.type = "text"
    [second]
    user.login.elements.password.type = "password"


load array of sections

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $sections = array('first', 'second');
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini(CONFIG . 'test.ini', $sections);
    $this->view->form = new Zend_Form($config->user->login);


Behaviour: only one form element displayed.

Changing line 152 of Zend/Config/Ini.php to use array\_merge\_recursive() fixes this for me.

Fixed in r19056.

Please use r19059 instead of r19059 because it contains a possible error in merging config data.
