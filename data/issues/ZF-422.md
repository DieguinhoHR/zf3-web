ZF-422: RewriteRouter detectRewriteBase() works incorrectly
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-10-04T15:09:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:22.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The function looks like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function detectRewriteBase()
        {
            $base = '';
            
            if (empty($_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) $base = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
            else if ($pos = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) {
                $base = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 0, $pos);
            }
            return rtrim($base, '/');
        } 


If the request is /index.php?param=value&param=value, eveything works OK.

If we use short URLs like /user/view, than the function returns /user/view as RewriteBase. It is not correct. I believe, for RewriteBase detection, $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] should be used.

This is depend on the php and apache configuration, see following for details. So I think the code should detect $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] since this variable is always defined!

Check [http://cn.php.net/manual/ro/â€¦](http://cn.php.net/manual/ro/ini.sect.path-directory.php)

cgi.fix\_pathinfo boolean

 
    Provides real PATH_INFO/PATH_TRANSLATED support for CGI. PHP's previous behaviour was to set PATH_TRANSLATED to SCRIPT_FILENAME, and to not grok what PATH_INFO is. For more information on PATH_INFO, see the cgi specs. Setting this to 1 will cause PHP CGI to fix it's paths to conform to the spec. A setting of zero causes PHP to behave as before. Default is zero. You should fix your scripts to use SCRIPT_FILENAME rather than PATH_TRANSLATED. 


and <http://cn.php.net/reserved.variables>

'PATH\_TRANSLATED'

 
    Filesystem- (not document root-) based path to the current script, after the server has done any virtual-to-real mapping.
    
        Note: As of PHP 4.3.2, PATH_TRANSLATED is no longer set implicitly under the Apache 2 SAPI in contrast to the situation in Apache 1, where it's set to the same value as the SCRIPT_FILENAME server variable when it's not populated by Apache. This change was made to comply with the CGI specification that PATH_TRANSLATED should only exist if PATH_INFO is defined.
    
        Apache 2 users may use AcceptPathInfo = On inside httpd.conf to define PATH_INFO.

The code can be changed as:

Reassigning to Martel, who is component lead for the RewriteRouter

Rewrite base detection (and handling) was recently moved to Request class (with a major rewrite to whole Controller module). At the time of writing modified code is evaluated in the incubator.
