### Description

In ZF1, exceptions thrown by PHP templates can be caught and redirected to the ErrorController.

In ZF 2.0, exceptions thrown by PHP templates cause a fatal 'uncaught exception' PHP error.

Can a mechanism be added for handling exceptions thrown during rendering? Ideally, it would be most useful if this mechanism could be used to dispatch an error controller (taking precautions to avoid infinite loops, of course).
