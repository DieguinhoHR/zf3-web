---------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-08-24T12:47:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.2.0 (29/Oct/06)

### Description

The isCcnum test passes cards that should not pass. This includes cards that contain x's ie 5105xxxxxxxx5100. The solution to this is to patch this function with

$value = self::getDigits($value);

to strip out any non digits before the length tests and before the mod 10.

Someone with karma to this component please add this code, or assign my svn account karma to this module.
