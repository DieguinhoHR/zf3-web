### Description

We added this method to Abstract.php. In our application, we call it after the adapter has been created. The rationale is to mitigate the risk that connection information may be disclosed (eg logs) if some error should later occur.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Reset the configuration variables in this adapter.
     */
    public function resetConfig()
    {
        $this->_config = array();
    }

We no longer require this within ZF ... we're now subclassing all the adapters that our app supports.

Feel free to close this issue.
