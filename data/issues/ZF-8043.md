ZF-8043: ID of dt and dd wrong when using with "belongsTo"
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Sub-task Created: 2009-10-10T06:11:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-20T11:49:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I've a form with some sub forms. In these sub forms, there are some name conflicts. The resulting HTML code is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        


    Test
            

    Test
            
        

As you can see, the id of the input field is prefixed with the name of the sub form (subform1, subform2). But the id of the dt and dd don't use this mechanism... The resulting HTML code is not valid!

Test case for the expected result

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testLabelDecoratorWithElementsBelongTo()
        {
            $this->form->addSubForm(new Zend_Form_SubForm(), 'foo')
                       ->foo->setElementsBelongTo('bar[foo]')
                            ->addElement('text','baz');
    
            $this->form->setView($this->getView());
            $html = $this->form->render();
    
            $this->assertRegexp('/id=.bar-foo-baz-label./', $html);
            $this->assertRegexp('/id=.bar-foo-baz-element./', $html);
        }
