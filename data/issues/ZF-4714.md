### Description

I am very sad that I cannot use Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::setMultiFile($cnt) function when using Zend\_File\_Transfer.

The simple code in the file attached to this issue will produce this exception:

**Fatal error**: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception' with message '"projectImage\_2\_" not found by file transfer adapter' in C:\\inetpub\\AK\\library\\Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\Abstract.php:1160 Stack trace:

I have attached this file b/c pasting the code into the description didn't work so well...

This issue has already been solved about 5 weeks ago. Please look always first if such a problem was already filled and/or solved.

Can you provide me with a link to the issue? I did in fact look, for a while, and found nothing.

It's also worth point out that, if the problem was in fact solved, it is still broken in the 1.7 pre-release.

The code freeze for 1.7 was about 4-5 weeks ago. Code freeze is always several days before the official release.

I tested your code with the actual trunk (1.7) and got no errors so it's already fixed in 1.7

Alright. Thanks for the quick responses.

I'd still be curious to see the corresponding issue, if for no other reason to see what words should have been in my search phrase.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
