### Description

It is very usefull to call some method before and after every SQL query, which would count how long every query took. Now the only way to do this is to edit Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract -> query method but this is not very comfortable, because after every framework update you would have to copy&paste PHP code.

Something like this could be done in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract.onBeforeQuery = null; Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract.onAfterQuery = null; Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract -> setOnBeforeQuery (callable function/method) Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract -> setOnAfterQuery (callable function/method)

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract -> query would look like this: public function query($sql, $bind = array()){ if($this->onBeforeQuery !== null){ call\_user\_func($this->onBeforeQuery, $sql); } ... if($this->onAfterQuery !== null){ call\_user\_func($this->onAfterQuery , $sql); } }

Would you please describe the advantages of the suggestions above compared to the existing Zend\_Db\_Profiler?

Sorry missed that Zend\_Db has profiler, which does the same. You can close this ticket.
