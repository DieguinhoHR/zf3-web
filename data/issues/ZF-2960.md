ZF-2960: $this->view->render($name) does not behave as documented

### Description

Section 7.7 of the programmers reference guide (and other places to) provide examples of how to call $this->view->render($sciptname) inside an action function in an ActionController.

The most basic examples in there do not work for me. So this is either a bug or the documentation should be updated (or I am terribly mistaken).

Inside myController I want two actions to render the same view.

I have saveAction and editAction.

I want saveAction to render my/save.phtml: no problem, works automatically when using MVC.

I want editAction to render my/save.phtml by calling $this->view->render('save'), as the documentation section 7.7 says. It results in an error: script 'save' not found in view/scipts/.

If I write echo $this->view->render('my/save.phtml') it works, but as soon as I delete my/edit.phtml from the file system, it starts complaining about not finding 'edit.phtml'.

First: it should be looking in scripts/my and Second: it should append .phtml. It does neither. So either the documentation is outdated and I am the only one that does not know (which is possible). Or the functionality is broken, but then lots of people should be complaining. They are not.

So this will probably come down to me missing something essential, but on the other hand, I have been digging for quite a while now and I can't find an easy solution.

In this case, I'm sorry to report that you're, to quote your own words, "terribly mistaken."

You're operating on the wrong object, plain and simple: when inside an action controller, you should not call render() on the view object, but rather on the current object:

Try:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->render('save'); // NOT $this->view->render('save');


Why? Because Zend\_Controller\_Action::render() proxies to the ViewRenderer, which does the view script normalization and lookup for you (adds the suffix and looks for the script in the directory named after the controller); it also does the auto-renderering, so if you call $this->view->render(), you're going to get unwanted results (rendered view script AND ViewRenderer will still be trying to render a script based on the current action). Zend\_View itself does not have the same functionality, and expects a fully qualified view script.

Look carefully at the documentation -- all examples are operating on the action controller object, and do not utilize the view object. In particular, look at section 7.7.5.

I'm only glad this was no issue! Readers should note that in the Zend Framework book by Cal Evans, Chapter 5, The View, the misunderstanding is introduced on page 60. I will give him feedback on this.

On second thought, checking the book for an e-mail address to send my feedback to, I find that you reviewed the book. So maybe you should tell him yourself :).
