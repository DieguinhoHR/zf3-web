ZF-10027: The condition does not make sense

### Description

/Zend/Currency line 139

if ($value === null) { if (is\_array($value) && isset($options['value'])) { ...

If something is null it can not be an array, it is always false.

and later in line 147 is if (is\_array($value)) {

It's not bug and it's not creating an error but also its not clear to understand, I suggest use: elseif (is\_array($value)) { because it's continue of pre validation and configuration.

ps

Closing as not reproduceable. The given code lines do not exist within trunk or branch.

@Thomas Weidner Did you open the file Zend/Currency.php?

Extract:

@version $Id: Currency.php 22368 2010-06-04 14:49:59Z thomas $

if ($value === null) { if (is\_array($options) && isset($options['value'])) { $value = $options['value']; } else { $value = $this->\_options['value']; } }

 
        if (is_array($value)) {
            $options += $value;
            if (isset($options['value'])) {
                $value = $options['value'];
            }
        }

@Ilya:

As I said the issue is not reproduceable. You are writing it yourself:

The issues code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (is_array($value) && isset($options['value'])) {
    ...
    
    If something is null it can not be an array, it is always false.


Your reply:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (is_array($options) && isset($options['value'])) {
    ...


I may be blind but "is\_array($options)" is not checked for NULL nor is it always FALSE as noted in the issues description.

In my eyes closing this issue as "not reproduceable for the next minor release 1.10.5" IS correct.
