Interesting... This is a php related problem. With PHP 5.2.5 there is no error thrown.

I'll have to dig deeper.

Okay, please let me know what more information I can provide to help. :)

FYI: I found the related php bug... <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=34757&edit=2>

Interesting... this bug was marked as fixed on 11 Oct 2005, but PHP 5.1.4 didn't come out until 4 May 2006... maybe that means nothing, but in any case, I cannot reproduce the PHP bug with my 5.1.4. Instead, I get the following output from the bug reproduction code:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    string(0) ""

Also Interesting is that with 5.2.5 I am getting no error at all. But with 5.1.4 iconv throws errors.

So this is really a PHP related problem which has been fixed somewhere on the road. Maybe the issue is another one... this was only the first I found related to iconv and unknown error.

The offending line of Zend\_Locale\_Format::\_parseDate() for the first error reported (line 824 of trunk r8550):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result['second'] = iconv_substr($splitted[0][0], $split, 2);


I find that the first described error occurs on my system with the following values:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $splitted[0][0] = "0"
    $split = 0
    2 = 2 :)


I found a user reporting this behavior on the PHP manual: [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.iconv-substr.php#75359). I agree that it is a problem with PHP or "below" in the stack, rather than with ZF.

My best estimate is that it's not worth writing a kludgy workaround in the framework for this problem with PHP, so I'm resolving this issue as won't fix. Please feel free to reopen with more information.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-03-05T10:45:17.000+0000

Shouldn't we change the test so that it runs through and add a comment in the testbed describing the false behaviour with "0" ?

Maybe someone else has this problem in future and we would otherwise not remember the problem/solution.

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-03-05T11:02:15.000+0000

Yes, that's actually a good idea... perhaps to trap the potential error within the test suite and skip the test if an error occurs?

Thank you Darby... exactly what I had in mind
