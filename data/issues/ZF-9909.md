ZF-9909: Statement containing both parentheses and AS clause
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Example SELECT statement is like this:

SELECT CAST(column\_name AS UNSIGNED) FROM table1

Code I used was:

1. $select = $db->select()
2. ->from(array('table1'),
3. array('CAST(column\_name AS UNSIGNED)',
4. );

which did not work - error returned, was: Could not find "table1.CAST(column\_name" field. As we know, if there is a parentheses inside the clause, it is considered to be a Zend\_Db\_Expr. But on the other hand, the existence of "AS" clause messes things up, making it think we have a field-name-alias here, which we don't. Its just CAST function's syntax. Of course I overcame the problem by explicitly telling it we are having Zend\_Db\_Expr with this code which worked:

1. $select = $db->select()
2. ->from(array('table1'),
3. array('column\_name' => new Zend\_Db\_Expr('CAST(column\_name AS UNSIGNED)'))
4. );

Question for developers of ZF is: Shouldn't you guys not touch any clauses, including AS clause, inside the statement which contains parentheses - the same way you do with Zend\_Db\_Expr objects? Statements with parentheses are considered to be Zend\_Db\_Expr objects, but at the same time they are not...

If you add 'as column\_name' in the column definition, it should work also without Zend\_Db\_Expr

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()->from(
        array('table1'),
        array('CAST(column_name AS UNSIGNED) as column_name')
    );

Dorogoy Artyom, then why on Earth would I use Zend\_Db at all?! Didn't you know that AS column\_name does not work in most RDBMS's, including MSSQL? The main reason for me in using Zend\_Db is because it abstracts Db management via Factory pattern, it keeps the code clean and it makes sure devs never write SQL/query, instead they model/design it.

Anyway, I believe your solution is very wrong and misleading when it comes to Zend Db.

Ok, I didn't know that. I only tried to use different Zend\_Db\_Adapter's and those given me a similar output.
