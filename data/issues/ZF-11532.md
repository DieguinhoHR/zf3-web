### Description

When validating a issn number of: 18710360 the created checksum is invalid.

According to the right issn check: "If there is no remainder the check digit is 0, otherwise the remainder value is subtracted from 11 to give the check digit"

In this case of the ISSN, the remainder is 0 so the checksum should be 0. However, zend makes the checksum 11-0=11.

Fixed in file: Zend/Validate/Barcode/Issn.php

Line: 110

Old:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $check  = 11 - $check;


New:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $check = ( $check === 0 ? 0 : (11 - $check) );

Set component and auto-reassign.
