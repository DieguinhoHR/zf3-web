ZF-316: Zend\_Config - add helper function for returning type value

### Description

I've created some helper functions getFloat, getBoolean,getString,getInteger to get values from config with right type.

For example

$config->getBoolean('database.debug');

I also add second parameter, where you can specify value in case it's missing in config (like some sort of default value)

I can add patch for Zend\_Config in case this would get into trunk. If not It can always be extendable in your own class if such function is needed.

regards

Isn't it just easier to cast after the retrieval for the few times you need to worry about it?

Agreed. Casting is the way to go here...

What about default value? Many app have option to just override what you need.

There is certainly an argument for a getWithDefault() type function. That's not this Issue though.

I've added it to the Zend\_Config enhancements wiki page ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_Config)) but I can't think of a good interface at the moment.

With default values I add this get\*\*\* methods and while I was writing this I add those helper functions.

I know this is maybe two different things here. But casting every thime I get some data from config. I know it's cleaner way to use jutst (string)$config->some->config. But I use config from Java and I thought that Zend\_Config could use such helper functions.

The thing is, you rarely need to cast in PHP: it'll sort out the type appropriately for the situation.

e.g.

config.ini: [general] debug = 1

$config = new Zend\_Config(new Zend\_Config\_Ini('config.ini', 'general'));

$debug = $config->debug;

if($debug == true) { // we end up in here as string of "1" is converted to true by PHP }

What about just get function?

public function get($name,$default=null)

Here you can use defaults.
