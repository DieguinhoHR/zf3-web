### Description

The new implementation of Zend\_View in 1.6.0 provides a stream wrapper that can be used when short tags are disabled. This needs to be disabled by default as it: \* degrades performance \* causes issues with suhosin (user stream wrappers are considered attack vectors by suhosin) When disabling, the stream wrapper should also be documented with examples of how to enable it, a note about issues with suhosin, and a note about performance degradation.
