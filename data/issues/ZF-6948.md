ZF-6948: Zend\_Amf\_Adobe\_Introspector works incorrectly for functions with default argument values

### Description

If php file contains following code:

<?php class Srv{ function myFunc($id="hello") { return $id; } } and is then introspected using Zend\_Amf\_Adobe\_Introspector the returned XML is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

Clearly this XML is not correct, it contains two different entries for the function "myFunc".

Actually, it is correct. myFunc has two valid signatures - myFunc() and myFunc(string).

Yes. But it would be better if only one signature is returned something like,

This will help the client, which is introspecting to get the default value. I will also tell that the argument id already has a default value so may not be passed.

Fixed by rev. 18086 in trunk - added default value [http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Standard_Library/?cs=18086)

The issue is not fixed in Zend Framework 1.9.4 and 1.9.5 Looks like the fix did not make into these builds, although the bug says that it got fixed in 1.9.3
