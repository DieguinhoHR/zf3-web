ZF-5166: Load router and dispatcher late, and assign variables only when utilizing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, the router and dispatcher are instantiated and initialized prior to the dispatch cycle -- meaning several things: \* No way to inject substitutions prior to routing/dispatch \* No way to add front controller parameters via plugins and have them injected

An easy way to correct the situation is to: \* have the get\*() methods lazyload default objects \* always use a get() method to retrieve the required object in order to perform the required dispatch operation

Ideally, the plugin broker should also allow iterating over plugins added during the same hook...

That's right. UML Compositions VS aggregations ;-)
