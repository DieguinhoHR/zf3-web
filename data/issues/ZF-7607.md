### Description

On Windows, inside a new created ZF directory (successful created with the zf tool cli) the following commands failed:

- zf create action add index

After the command "zf create module admin" the following message occurs:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
                           An Error Has Occurred
     A project profile was not found.
    
    Zend Framework Command Line Console Tool v1.9.1
    Details for action "Create" and provider "Module"
      Module
        zf create module name


I have a look at <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7465> but this did not solve the problem.
