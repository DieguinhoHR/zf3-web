### Description

53.1.4. Short Tags with View Scripts Authors explain that : In our examples and documentation, we make use of PHP short tags: <? and <?=. In addition, we typically use the alternate syntax for control structures. These are convenient shorthands to use when writing view scripts, as they make the constructs more terse, and keep statements on single lines. In coding-standard document ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.coding-style.html)) authors explain that : PHP code must always be delimited by the full-form, standard PHP tags: <?php ?> Short tags are never allowed

Short tags are not allows in the code itself. But view scripts are not code, they are view for browser for example. View can also be XML output.

As Thomas noted, the Coding Standards are for PHP code, and in particular class files. We have consistently messaged that view scripts do not fall under the same umbrella.
