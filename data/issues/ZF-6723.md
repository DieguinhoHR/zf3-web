### Description

Zend\_Locale\_Format::getNumber('2,2,3', array('locale' => 'en\_EN')) == 233 Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat('2,2,3', array('locale' => 'en\_EN')) === true

Looks like thousands separator can occur in every place in number, is it done intentionally?

Fixed with r15890.

Note: Number parsing should generic be done with lentacy. (described in CLDR). Originally the check was very loosly. We hardend is.

With this changeset it's now no longer possible to use wrong placed grouping chars like above, not allowed characters (like whitespaces or not allowed alphabetic chars) and much more.
