ZF-8070: Add setClassmap to Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-10-14T07:15:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:38.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Server has a function setClassmap. But when using the Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover to generate the wsdl it is not possible to use the classmap. So the generated wsdl contains the class names used on the server, while the soap envelopes will contain the mapped names.
