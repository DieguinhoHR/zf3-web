### Description

This change will allow for array style access, standardise return types for collections of values, and allow for Iterator access across the Reader. This will resolve in future versions the current inconsistency in returning data collections without breaking compatibility. It will also somewhat simplify the task of importing Reader data into a Writer component among other things.
