### Description

It would be useful if the Zend\_Pdf library could create password protected documents, this is great for example having to dynamically create a pdf document with sensitive information and emailing it to a user.

If the document has sensitive information in it, wouldn't it be a more effective security policy _not_ to email it to users?

Just joking...! ;-)

Assigning to Alexander pending future prioritization.
