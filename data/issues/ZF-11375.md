ZF-11375: Zend\_Feed\_Atom's write API doesn't escape many header values

### Description

The following values are not escaped in Zend\_Feed\_Atom's \_mapFeedHeaders(): \* (which uses the link entry) \* (both the author and email entries) \* (the copyright entry) \* (the image entry) \* (the generator entry)

Most of the other header array entries are either escaped by virtue of being used in setAttribute or another DOM function that escapes its input, or manually included in a CDATA section. However, the above-listed entries are passed directly to createElement, which does not escape.

The problem is particularly bad for , because it uses the link entry which is also output _escaped_ in a element. So, if your feed link contains ampersands, there's no way to get it to output correctly. If you escape it yourself, it gets double-escaped when output in the element, and if you don't escape it, you get DOM warnings and the element gets cut off.

Additionally, the corresponding method for entries, \_mapFeedEntries, doesn't escape \* \* \*

Please use Zend\_Feed\_Writer to create feeds, as its write support is more thorough and well-tested. The original Zend\_Feed and Zend\_Feed\_Builder are deprecated in favor of Zend\_Feed\_Reader and Zend\_Feed\_Writer.
