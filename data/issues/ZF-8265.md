What is the outcome you had expected, and how do you propose to solve this (without losing functionality, while generating valid html for other versions)?

The expected outcome is just

 test, instead of test as attribute 'disabledfor' is not allowed in any of HTML (and XHTML) flavors.

I think the expected behaviour was meant to be like commented by Mr O'Phinney:

I found problem in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormLabel.

If 'disableFor' attribute is set (and for radio it is) $for is cleaned to empty string, but disableFor attribute still exists $attribs array, so $this->\_htmlAttribs($attribs) produces all attribs for label including disablefor="1". The simple solution could be just to remove array element:

// $for = (empty($attribs['disableFor']) || !$attribs['disableFor']) // ? ' for="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"' // : '';

 
        if (empty($attribs['disableFor']) || !$attribs['disableFor']) {
            $for = ' for="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"';
        }
        else {
            $for = '';
            //Remove $attribs['disableFor'] from array
            unset($attribs['disableFor']);
        }

if (empty($attribs['disableFor']) || !$attribs['disableFor']) { $for = ' for="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"'; } else { $for = ''; unset($attribs['disableFor']); }

Sorry for double post.

Anyone can confirm this ?

What shall I do now ?

Added code to unset 'disableFor' attribute if set, attached the patch and test. Please review.

Changed diffs to svn-generated diffs instead of Netbeans.
