ZF-2086: Zend\_Translate TMX adapter collapses XML tags
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-10-18T12:04:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-11-15T14:14:45.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.3 (30/Nov/07)

### Description

The Zend\_Translate adapter for TMX and XLIFF don't seem to take message datatypes other than plain text into account. For instance, say I have the following segment in a TMX file:

Success!
========

Click **Restart** to reset the installer after correcting these problems.

When I request the message TEST using Zend\_Translate for the en\_US locale, I get the following text:

Success!Click Restart to reset the installer after correcting these problems.

The adapter doesn't appear to respect data types other than plain text, even when the datatype attribute is set on the element or in the header.

Datatypes are not supported with this TMX. XLIFF does not define a datatype attribute. You could htmlencode your translations or write your own extended adapter.

Generally speaking this is no bug but an feature request ;-)

Thomas:

Your Tmx.php works for me. Thanks. The same or similar patch should work in Xliff.php too.
