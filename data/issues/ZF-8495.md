ZF-8495: Zend\_Db\_Table : Incorrect default values
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-08T07:22:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-18T14:33:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If you have fields in your database table with an empty string as a default value, Zend\_Db\_Table (\_Row) will set / insert NULL instead of a string(0) "".

The bug is in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract: 1426 in the if clause: ($metadata['DEFAULT'] != null)

but it should be: ($metadata['DEFAULT'] !== null)

This only works when your field is NULLABLE, generally with my apps when an empty field exists is better to treat as NULL.

In 1.7 a new feature was introduced to all you to choose where default values come from. Since that version, I think the issue here no longer applies.

Please see the API docs here for the new feature, particularly the $defaultSource option: [http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Db/Table/Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.html#createRow)
