ZF-3735: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row::\_refresh() populates previously unpopulated columns

### Description

After a select() in which I query only a limited number of fields, like:

$table->select()->from($table, array('id', 'title')) etcetera...

if I execute this my row object only has two column properties, like i would expect. However, after an update via save(), \_refresh() is called, which populates \*all\* columns.

The resulting behavior seems rather inconsistent:

$row = $table->fetchRow($select); /\* results in a row with only two column properties _/ $row->title = "New"; /_ trying to access other columns, besides 'id' will fail, of course _/ $row->save(); /_ but after this, $row suddenly has all columns populated \*/

And yes of course, if I really want to any performance benefits from limiting the select to two fields, I shouldn't be using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row anyway, so this is just a dumb idea to begin with. But the behavior just seems, well, wrong....

I dont think your use case is supported by the Table-Row Gateway pattern. The reason why \_refesh() is called is so that the Row object is kept in sync with database row - which means, consequently, it needs to keep each column updated that is defined within the table.

I am inclined to mark this as "wont fix" / "not an issue"

Simon, what do you think?

Can I close as not an issue?
