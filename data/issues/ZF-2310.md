### Description

Add an default locale which will be used in the case that wether the browser nor the server provides a locale.

In this case the exception would not be thrown and instead the default locale would be used.

First to solve the detection problems before handling the undetectable "C" locale.

I just come across this issue. I work on a MacBook Pro and I created a simple Zend\_Service\_Delicious script.

This issue causes Zend\_Service\_Delicious to fail when called via shell on my Mac. I posted all details here ZF-2318.

About this issue I [[http://icynorth.com/forums/viewtopic.php/â€¦](http://www.icynorth.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1917&sid=ea9e75a6518fbc41f62e21beea5523ff%7Cfound) a topic] that apparently describes the same problem. I vote +1 for a default locale setting on detection failure.

Sorry, but Zend\_Service\_Delicious has NOTHING to do with Zend\_Locale. You can solve your problem this way:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    setlocale(LC_ALL, 'it_IT');
    $service = new Zend_Service_Delicious();


In general the problem is that Zend\_Service\_Delicious does not handle exceptions from Zend\_Locale properly.

Hi Thomas,

I know that the _specific_ Zend\_Service\_Delicious issue has nothing to do with this Zend\_Locale issue. This is why I posted ZF-2318 under the proper Zend\_Service\_Delicious category.

However, my comment was to point out how executing Zend\_Locale under Mac Osx via shell causes

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    setlocale(LC_ALL, 0);


to return _C_ string instead of a valid locale variable and, in general, it causes Zend\_Locale to throw an Exception. In this specific issue, my comment was a kind of agreement to your 'default locale' suggestion. :)

I also noticed that Zend\_Locale autodetection calls this function

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Returns the locale which the framework is set to
         */
        public function getFramework()
        {
            $languages = array();
            return $languages;
        }


but it seems closed to itself without any possibility of adding defaul languages without extending the class itself. Is it a bug or a design decision? (May be this should be a different issue?)

PS. About Zend\_Service\_Delicious, I already used setlocale(LC\_ALL, 'en\_US'); as a workaround before and it works but I think something should be improved in the class itself, this is why I opened a new issue at ZF-2318.

The getFramework() method was added because when this proposal was made there was a discussion of adding a generic framework wide config.

There is still a proposal which aims to do so... this is what this method was made for. As the related proposal is still not implemented the method is still empty.

This is no bug, it was a design decision of the dev-team.

Thanks for your clarifications, Thomas.

Implemented with SVN-7175.
