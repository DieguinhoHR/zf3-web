### Description

Lucene 2.1 onwards has Int8 "isCompundFile" flag in the segment descriptor.

Lucene description for this flag follows:

"IsCompoundFile records whether the segment is written as a compound file or not. If this is -1, the segment is not a compound file. If it is 1, the segment is a compound file. Else it is 0, which means we check filesystem to see if \_X.cfs exists."

However, ZF code (Lucene.php) treats isCompoundFile as a boolean. This fails (throws an exception) when the segment is explicitly not a compound file, as is the case for indexes produced by Lucene Nutch (web crawl and search tool).
