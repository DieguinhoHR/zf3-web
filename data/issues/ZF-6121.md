### Description

In App::importUrl() we set the API version for a data model class after the XML is already parsed. This causes a problem where certain XML elements end up in the extension\_elements array instead of being parsed. The version needs to be determined prior to XML parsing in order to ensure that every XML element is addressed properly.
