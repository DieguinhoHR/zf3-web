### Description

IÂ´m using a Zend Controller in conjunction with Soap. My Zend action is only initializing the server:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        public function soapAction()
        {
            $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender();
    
            $server = new SoapServer('...');
            $server->setClass('...');
    
            $server->handle();
    
        }
    


Whenever this action is called i'm getting following notice:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Notice:  ob_get_clean() [<a href="ref.outcontrol">ref.outcontrol</a>]: failed to delete buffer default output handler. in Zend\Controller\Dispatcher\Standard.php on line 308


I'm not opening an output buffer in my webservice class at all. I'm using the current version of the Zend Framework and of the Soap Server.

Simply remove $this->\_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender();

It would works

Zend\_Controller by default uses an output buffer, you can turn this behavior off in Zend\_Application, but ideally, if you are using Soap within Zend\_Controller, you should close the existing output buffer if your soap class plans to return a response to the client and end the controller lifecycle.
