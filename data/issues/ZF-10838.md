### Description

I want to use the ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Element in lazy load.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array(
        'elements' => array(
            'type' => 'datePicker',
            'name' => 'date'
        )
    ));

ZendX\_JQuery\_Form will do what you are looking for:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $zf = new ZendX_JQuery_Form(array(
        'elements' => array(
            'date' => array(
                'type' => 'datePicker'
            )
        )
    ));

Outch, I never noticed this class >_< My mistake. The solution is not the same between ZendX\_Application\_Resource_\* and ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Element\_\*. If you look the issue ZF-8751, you have any class ZendX\_Application, and the path is updated for the plugin loader. I made a patch in the same way.

Not an issue you should use ZendX\_JQuery\_Form that already resolved this.

Issue resolved: User should use ZendX\_JQuery\_Form instead of Zend\_Form
