ZF-1754: Pass Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url parameters similar to \_forward and redirector helper
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The current Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url allows an associative array to pass values and assemble a URL. It would be great if the helper could not only support:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->url(array('controller' => 'home', 'action' => 'news', 'module' => 'default', 'id' => 3), 'default', true)


but also numeric indices to provide parameters in the same way that the Zend\_Controller methods accept URLs in the 'action, controller, module, params' strategy. E.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->url(array('news', 'home', 'default', array('id' => 3)), 'default', true)


This usage would be BC and non-intrusive, but allow slightly less verbose view code.

Assigning to [~matthew] to initiate issue review.

While I see the benefit to that, the way that routes work is that they utilize named parameters in order to assemble a URL; introducing this would break that paradigm.

I suggest, instead, a 'urlSimple' helper that does what you suggest above, and am scheduling it for the 1.1.0 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
