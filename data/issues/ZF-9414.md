ZF-9414: Zend\_Filter\_Input should probably implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface

### Description

As far as it's used (probably even more often than for filtering) for validation it should implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface. It does implement it already, you only need to add 'implements Zend\_Validate\_Interface'.

Actually, it doesn't fully implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface. Zend\_Validate\_Interface::isValid() expects a value; Zend\_Filter\_Input::isValid() makes that value optional, which breaks the contract.
