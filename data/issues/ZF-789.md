### Description

In working with the HTTP client, we noticed that it rejects Set-Cookie headers that have a space before or after the "=", such as "Foo = Bar".

This is not strictly legal according to the RFC but we have found it to happen somewhat often. The popular browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari) still parse the Set-Cookie header in these cases. Therefore, I think we should also.
