### Description

_from the mailing list... from krazynio@gmail.com_

In Zend\_Controller\_Action, the signature of method run() is: final public function run(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface $dispatcher, Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Token $action)

Bug is in this function on line 111: $methodName = $dispatcher->formatActionName($action->getActionName());

The method "formatActionName()" hasn't been defined in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface. It means that even if you have a dispatcher implements Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface, it can't be used in Zend\_Controller\_Action.

-- Best regards, Nio
