### Description

When loading a date from our oracle database we get it in a form like this:

16-JUN-2010 13:10:33

When I try to make a Zend\_Date object of this string I get strange dates.

It does work when I convert the string into

16-Jun-2010 13:10:33

Maybe it's better to treat the month part lowercase/uppercase?

Closing as won't fix.

There is no way to make the months case-insensitive. Take "برمهات", "פבר" or "फेब्रुवारी". And there are much more languages.
