### Description

Output filters receive offhand mention in the Zend\_View docs, but finding out how to create one requires an excessive amount of digging in the API docs to discern. This feature deserves its own section in the reference guide. This blog post may be helpful in forming such a section: [http://matthewturland.com/2008/06/â€¦](http://matthewturland.com/2008/06/04/output-filters-in-zend_view).
