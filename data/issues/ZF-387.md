### Description

create a alternative to load ini file without using the function parse\_ini\_file()

Ini-Values with geted datatypes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    true/on/yes  -> boolean : true
    false/off/no -> boolean : false
    null         -> null
                 -> null
    0            -> int : 0
    1            -> int : 1
    1.1          -> float : 1.1
    "0"          -> string : 0
    "1"          -> string : 1
    "1.1"        -> string : 1.1
    abc          -> string : abc
    "abc"        -> string : abc
    "ab\nc"      -> string : "ab\nc"  (\n = parsed)
    'ab\nc'      -> string : 'ab\nc' (\n = not parsed)
    "ab
    c"           -> string : "ab\nc" (\n = parsed)


And allowing a numeric key to create lists in the ini value:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foo.bar.0 = "element"
    foo.bar.1 = true
    foo.bar.2 = no
    foo.bar.3 = 345
    foo.bar.4 = -345
    -> get array(
        0 => "element",
        1 => true,
        2 => false,
        3 => 345,
        4 => -345
    )

If you allow numeric keys in the ini file, I think that you would get PHP parse errors for the case of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $x = $config->foo->bar->0;


How should that be handled?

Numeric Keys are only allowed as last key in the ini file then it can handled as array. These keys are not keys in the normal sense. It is a list-value of the key foo.bar

In Zend\_Config\_Array and Zend\_Config\_Xml these lists can use too.

Example Array:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config['system_requirements'] = array(
        'php' => array(
            'extension' => array('mbstring', 'libxml', gd2)
        )
    );


Example Xml:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    mbstringlibxmlgd2

After some discussion with Darby, I'm resolving this as won't fix as it's possible to do

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $array = array_values($config->foo->bar);


for those cases when you must have a numeric array rather than an associative one.

OK, then I must create a list manuely. But are the saved data types without array-lists as "Won't fix" too?

Certainly not going to be looked at before 0.2.

In general, I'm not in favour of reimplementing parse\_ini\_file() in PHP though as parse\_ini\_file() is nice and quick. I suppose it depends on how useful type information is for a config class. What uses do you have that require type information?
