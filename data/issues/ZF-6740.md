Zend Search Lucene attempts to use invalid class 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_termStreamsPriorityQueue' on line 1461

Easily fixed by changing the case to upper camel case: Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_TermStreamsPriorityQueue

The class Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_termStreamsPriorityQueue is defined in Zend/Search/Lucene/TermStreamsPriorityQueue.php .

The class is used by Zend/Search/Lucene.php and Zend/Search/Lucene/MultiSearcher.php

In our setup the require\_once:s have been stripped, and auto loader loads everything according to their class name and set include paths. Using a lower case name causes the loader to fail, as the class is actually named Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_TermSearchPriorityQueue, instead of Zend\_Search.\_Lucene\_termSearchPriorityQueue.

So the issue is not with the class definition, but with the way Zend/Search/Lucene.php calling it by a wrong name.

This probably is not a problem for case-insensitive OS's such as windows.

.. and above all the "TermSearchPriorityQueue"s should obviously read "TermStreamsPriorityQueue".
