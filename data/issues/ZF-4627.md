### Description

Here is some code:

$playlistListEntry->title->setText('New Text'); $playlistListEntry->description->setText('New Description'); $playlistListEntry->save();

It seems the client library is sending malformed atom:categories:

http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/â€¦> http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind'/>

The second is spurious and causes a 400 error. The first has the wrong term.

I can't reproduce this. If I have an authenticated client and do this on my first playlist:

$first->title->setText('Updated PL'); $first->description->setText('new desc'); $first->save();

The following XML gets generated:

www.w3.org/2005/Atom"> ... [ snip ]

and the response is a 200 OK. After the put, the categories are also correct.
