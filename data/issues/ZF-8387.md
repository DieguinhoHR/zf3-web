-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-11-25T00:44:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-25T04:32:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Add the possibility to add openend streams or files that would be handled as streams because POST or PUT Requests with large files (>MEMORY\_LIMIT) would cause a big problem if you try to use ->setRawBody(file\_get\_contents()) or such stuff.
