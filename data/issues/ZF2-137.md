### Description

Actually the documentation notes TAGS as best variant to be used for cleaning cache entries. This is only the case for 2 or 3 of the supported backends.

All backends which do not support tags should emulate tags within Zend\_Cache when possible.

cloned from ZF-6400

For ZF2 it should be possible to implement a plug-in to add tagging functionality.
