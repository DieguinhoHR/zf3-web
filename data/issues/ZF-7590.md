### Description

Apparently PHP's OO Mysqli adapter class does not correctly handle large integers when it returns the last insert ID.

See the following note [http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.insert-id.php#84625) on PHP's website. I'll quote it here, as well: {quote} Watch out for the oo-style use of $db->insert\_id. When the insert\_id exceeds 2^31 (2147483648) fetching the insert id renders a wrong, too large number. You better use the procedural mysqli\_insert\_id( $db ) instead.

[EDIT by danbrown AT php DOT net: This is another prime example of the limits of 32-bit signed integers.] {quote}

So, we should be able to work around the problem by replacing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function lastInsertId($tableName = null, $primaryKey = null)
        {
            $mysqli = $this->_connection;
            return (string) $mysqli->insert_id;
        }


with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function lastInsertId($tableName = null, $primaryKey = null)
        {
            $mysqli = $this->_connection;
            return (string) mysqli_insert_id($mysqli);
        }


I'll test this and submit a patch when ready.

I cannot actually reproduce this using PHP 5.2.6, 5.2.9 or 5.2.10. It was originally reported to me by someone using 5.2.4, which I do not have available at this moment... If someone is willing to run a test or two for me on 5.2.4, please let me know.

ZF requires 5.2.6, is this an issue with PHP 5.2.6+? If not, I think we can close this as not an issue.
