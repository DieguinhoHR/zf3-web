### Description

_Note to admins reading this: there should be a Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover component, I had to use Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl here instead._

Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover support setting WSDL binding and operation styles (such as rpc-encoded, rpc-literal, document-literal) since [rev 13137](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Standard_Library/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Soap?cs=13137) (ZF-5188). However, the generated _document-literal_ WSDL does not comply with the <a href="">www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html</a>" rel="nofollow">WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 and is _not interoperable_ with other popular clients such as .NET, JAX-RPC, JAX-WS, or gSOAP (see ZF-6049 for a example with JAX-WS).

The [WS-I Basic Profile 1.1](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#Bindings_and_Parts) specifies that document-literal WSDL documents must use an element attribute in message parts (R2204), and that message can only contain zero or one part (R2210). This makes functions with more than 1 parameter impossible to represent this way. A commonly accepted workaround implemented in .NET and Java (probably others too, except PHP...) is to _wrap parameters_ in a complexType, and have this complexType in an element with the _same name_ as the function. The message part would then be named "parameters" and make reference to the said element.

For more information about this "document-literal-wrapped" convention, see the following links: \* [[http://ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/…](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-whichwsdl/)] \* [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/…](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996466.aspx)] \* [[http://atmanes.blogspot.com/2005/03/…](http://atmanes.blogspot.com/2005/03/wrapped-documentliteral-convention.html)]

The attached patch adds support for _WS-I compliant and interoperable document-literal WSDL generation_. It also fixes _rpc-literal_ WSDL generation to be WS-I compliant. I will detail what this patch does exactly in a comment below.

Making PHP work with the generated WSDL is beyond the scope of this issue, I think, so I created ZF-6351 to discuss it.

Note: this patch depends on 2 others patches I submitted earlier under ZF-6346 and ZF-6348.

This patch makes Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover generate valid WSDL with respect to the [WSDL Schema](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/) and <a href="">www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html</a>" rel="nofollow">WS-I Basic Profile 1.1. Points to note: \* A new \_addFunctionToWsdl() protected method avoids duplicating code in setClass() and addFunction() \* The types node must precede (almost) all other elements ([R2023](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#Placement_of_WSDL_import_Elements)), so addSchemaTypeSection() is called right after instantiating Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl. \* When using the \*document\* style, parameters (arguments and return value) are wrapped as described in the issue description above. Using elements to describe parameters instead of parts also allows having \*optional\* (nillable) parameters. \* When using the \*RPC\* style, parameters are described in typed message parts (as before). Additionally, a \*namespace\* attribute is automatically added to the \_operationBodyStyle if not already present, as required by [R2717](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#Namespaces_for_soapbind_Elements) \* Function \*documentation\* is now supported (depends on ZF-6346) \* Message names had to be changed from $name.'Request' / $name.'Response' to \*$name.'In' / $name.'Out'\* (inspired by .NET) to avoid confusion, because the return value's wrapper element must be named $name.'Response' too

Here is another patch to update AutoDiscover tests. With this patch applied, all tests pass.

Additionally, during the development of these patches, I used a custom ZFTestService project and TestService class to test compliance and interoperability with other SOAP clients. The produced document-literal and rpc-literal WSDL documents were tested with: \* the [WS-I Interoperability Testing Tools 1.1](http://www.ws-i.org/deliverables/workinggroup.aspx?wg=testingtools) - and passed compliance tests. Note though that the ArrayOfTypeSequence strategy must be used instead of ArrayOfTypeComplex, as the latter uses soap-enc:Array, which is forbidden by the [WS-I Basic Profile 1.1](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html#soapenc_Array). \* a _.NET 2.0_ client in C# - everything worked \* a _JAX-RPC_ client (for rpc-literal) and _JAX-WS_ client (for document-literal) - everything worked \* a _C++_ client using _gSOAP_ - everything worked

Since these tests need external tools, I don't think they could be integrated in automated tests.. what to do with them?

Thanks Fabien. I do confirm that when I tried to generate a Web Service Java client with Nebeans 6.7, the wsdl generated by 1.8 zend soap autodiscover seems to be invalid: [WARNING] R2716 WSI-BasicProfile ver. 1.0, namespace attribute not allowed in doc/lit for soapbind:body: "get\_token" [WARNING] ignoring operation "get\_token": message part does not refer to a schema element declaration

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autodiscover = new Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover();
      
    $autodiscover->setOperationBodyStyle(
                        array('use' => 'literal',
                              'namespace' => $CFG->wwwroot)
                    );
                  
    $autodiscover->setBindingStyle(
                        array('style' => 'document')
                    );
    
    $autodiscover->setClass('ws_authentication',$CFG->wwwroot);
                    $autodiscover->handle();


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * authentication class 
     */
    class ws_authentication {
        /**
         *
         * @param array|struct $params
         * @return integer
         */
        function get_token($params) {
            if ($params['username'] == 'wsuser' && $params['password'] == 'wspassword') {
                return '456';
            } else {
                throw new moodle_exception('wrongusernamepassword');
            }
        }
    }


Btw it is hard to find any document on how to make a basic Java or .Net client for Zend\_SOAP. Does someone know a blog/document explaining about to write/setup an autodiscover working with any basic Java client generator.

Fixed in trunk as of issue r15832.

Please test this patch against your Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover production code!!
