### Description

When parsing a HTTP response with "Transfer-encoding: chunked" header Zend\_Http\_Response::getBody() tries to decode the body using Zend\_Http\_Response::decodeChunkedBody(). Unfortunately the decoded body is not trimmed as Zend\_Http\_Response::extractBody() already does for not chunked bodies. This results in a problem when using Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client because SimpleXML expects the XML declaration at the start of the document. I'd like to suggest to change Zend\_Http\_Response::decodeChunkedBody() as follows (i.e. simply adding a ltrim() call before returning the decoded body): see attachement.

Hi, and thanks for the report and patch.

Are you using ::decodeChunkedBody() statically without instantiating a Response object?

If you could supply me with some reproduction code (for example a URL that I can send a request to that returns such problematic response) that would be most useful. The reason I need it is because the body which is decoded using decodeChunkedBody() should already be trimmed from the leading blank line as it is received from the server.

Additionally, your bug made me notice an even bigger issue - in some cases, the extractBody() method removed intentional blank lines and spaces from the response body - this is of course not acceptable, and I would like to change it, and not use ltrim() in any case.

Hi,

I noticed this problem when using Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client aggregates an instance of Zend\_Http\_Client and calls Zend\_Http\_Client::request() within Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::doRequest(). Zend\_Http\_Client::request() calls Zend\_Http\_Response::fromString() to construct an instance of Zend\_Http\_Response. Zend\_Http\_Response::fromString() on his part calls Zend\_Http\_Response::extractBody() to get the contents. ::extractBody() uses ltrim() to string newlines. Later Zend\_Http\_Response::getBody() is called. If the body is not chunked there is no problem because there are no leading newlines and the XML declaration is at the start of the document. But if the body is chunked the decoded body may contain new lines. Which results in an error when SimpleXML tries to parse the document in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Response::loadXml(). Please look at the attached sample responses (XML-RPC response bodies cut off). On closer inspection you will notice that Zend\_Http\_Response will cut off all leading newlines in response-not-chunked.txt which results in a valid XML document. But in response-chunked.txt Zend\_Http\_Reponse will only cut off newlines that stand ahead of the first length information (line 9).

I'm not sure wheter simply removing all leading newlines (as I proposed) is the best way to solve the problem. Maybe it would be a better approach for this particular problem to remove leading newlines in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Response::loadXml().

Looking at the samples you sent, it looks like the problem is in the response (and in the way Zend\_XmlRpc parses it) and not in Zend\_Http\_Client. The chunked response actually contains leading spaces (sent by the server). Logically, Zend\_Http\_Client should not be cutting off any data from the response sent by the server - including leading white space, as long as it's a part of the response body.

I suggest changing Zend\_XmlRpc to trim any whitespace from the response body if it causes SimpleXML to fail.

I am assiging this to the XmlRpc owners - I will also file a new bug on Zend\_Http\_Response because it shouldn't be trimming anything at all (which now it does).

I'm having trouble finding a way to re-create the issue in a test, and will need to consult with Shahar to fix. Rescheduling for next mini release following 1.5.0.

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-03-21T17:05:27.000+0000

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-04-18T13:11:52.000+0000

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Scheduling for next minor release; need to work with Shahar on a way to test this.

Assigning to Shahar; need help determining how to test to recreate the issue.

Shahar, any ideas here?

How about this for a reproducing test case: I used the OP's 'response-chunked.txt' file as a basis to create this test response:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Thu, 06 Sep 2007 14:58:44 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.0.54 (Debian GNU/Linux) DAV/2 SVN/1.1.4 mod_python/3.1.3 Python/2.3.5 mod_ssl/2.0.54 OpenSSL/0.9.7e PHP/5.1.6
    X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.6
    Connection: close
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
    
    92 
    
     
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    FOO
     
    0 
     


Then run the following unit test using it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * @group ZF-1897
         */
        public function testCallFailsWhenHttpClientDoesNotTrimChunkedResponse()
        {
            $baseUri = "http://foo:80";
            $this->httpAdapter = new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Test();
            $this->httpClient = new Zend_Http_Client(null, array('adapter' => $this->httpAdapter));
            
            $respBody = file_get_contents(dirname(__FILE__) . "/_files/ZF1897-response-chunked.txt");
            $this->httpAdapter->setResponse($respBody);
    
            $this->xmlrpcClient = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client($baseUri);
            $this->xmlrpcClient->setHttpClient($this->httpClient);
            
            $this->assertEquals('FOO', $this->xmlrpcClient->call('foo'));
        }


The result of this test is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ++ phpunit --verbose --group ZF-1897 AllTests
    PHPUnit 3.5.13 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    [...snipped...]
    There was 1 error:
    1) Zend_XmlRpc_ClientTest::testCallFailsWhenHttpClientDoesNotTrimChunkedResponse
    Zend_XmlRpc_Client_FaultException: Failed to parse response
    [...snipped...]


Apply Shahar's suggested fix (trim the body):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Index: library/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php
    ===================================================================
    --- library/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php      (revision 24104)
    +++ library/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php      (working copy)
    @@ -294,7 +294,7 @@
                 $response = new Zend_XmlRpc_Response();
             }
             $this->_lastResponse = $response;
    -        $this->_lastResponse->loadXml($httpResponse->getBody());
    +        $this->_lastResponse->loadXml(trim($httpResponse->getBody()));
         }
    
         /**


...and the unit test above (and the XmlRpc test suite as a whole) now passes.

So it looks to me like trimming the body is the way to go. Thoughts?
