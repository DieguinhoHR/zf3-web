### Description

The last week of 2008 is the week 53 but the get() function return 01.

$date = new Zend\_Date('2008-12-31') ; print $date->get(Zend\_Date::WEEK) ;

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/fr/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/fr/zend.date.constants.html)

12.9. Week Constants Description : "Week (as a number, 1-53)"

The doc should be corrected to : "Week (as a number, 1-52)" or the code to return the week 53 correctly.

I really don't know what for a calendar you are using but my gregorian calendar shows for the 31.12.2008 the week 1.

This is the definition from ISO:

- weeks start on a monday
- week 1 of a given year is the one that includes the first Thursday of that year. (or, equivalently, week 1 is the week that includes 4 January.)

Ah well, I probly need to check that ISO stuff you are talking about... My logical brain cannot accept that a day in 2008 is in the next year first week. :)
