ZF-7255: Unclear term in Zend Framework quickstart tutorial

### Description

On this page: [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-layout)

is this statement

"Now that we've initialized Zend\_Layout and set the Doctype, let's create our site-wide layout:"

"Zend\_Layout" appears to be a term relating to an object, element or something else that is in the code but it is not. As far as I can tell, we haven't "initialized" anything with the name "Zend\_Layout" by that point in the tutorial. It is referenced in the phrasing above, but does not appear in the code. Confusing.

Clearly, something is missing (and if not then the wording MUST change) because when I follow the link to the Zend\_Layout documentation, I see this:

bq: First, let's look at how to initialize Zend\_Layout for use with the MVC:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // In your bootstrap:
    Zend_Layout::startMvc();


And further down in the documentation not relating to MVC, there's this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $layout = new Zend_Layout();


neither of which are on the aforementioned quick start page immediately before "Now that we've initialized Zend\_Layout and set the Doctype, let's create our site-wide layout:"

Closing as not reproduceable.

First we can read:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    In Zend Framework, Zend_Layout combines the ideas behind these patterns. Instead of each action view script needing to include site-wide artifacts, they can simply focus on their own responsibilities.


Then we can read:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    To get started using Zend_Layout, first we need to inform our bootstrap to use the Layout resource. This can be done using the zf enable layout command: 


And at last:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Now that we've initialized Zend_Layout and set the Doctype, let's create our site-wide layout: 


For me this is logically even if I did not work with Zend\_Layout until now.

When you want to have a "rewritten content" I would propose that you note what should be changed.

As this issue is also several months old and related to an outdated release I close it as not reproduceable.
