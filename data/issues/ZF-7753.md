### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Route doesn't accepts 'action' for url assembling.

E.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $navi = new Zend_Navigation();
    $page = Zend_Navigation_Page::factory(array('controller' => 'page',  'label'    => 'Pages');
    $page2 = Zend_Navigation_Page::factory(array('controller' => 'page',  'label' => 'New page', 'action' => 'new');
    $page2->setParent($page);
    $navi->addPage($page);
    
    Zend_Registry::set('Zend_Navigation', $navi);


then in the view

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?=$this->navigation()->menu(); ?>


will result into

 
    <pre class="highlight">


                    <a href="/page">Page</a>

                            <a href="/page">Create new page</a>
                        
                    

Solution: Modify the assemble() method.

In Zend\_Rest\_Route, line 248, add:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(isset($params[$this->_actionKey])) {
                $action = $params[$this->_actionKey];
                if($action === $this->_defaults[$this->_actionKey]) {
                    $action = '';
                } else {
                    $action = '/' . $params[$this->_actionKey];
                }
            } else {
                $action = '';
            }


In Zend\_Rest\_Route, line 261, replace:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!empty($url) || $controller !== $this->_defaults[$this->_controllerKey]) {
                    $url = '/' . $controller . $url;
    }


with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $url = '/' . $controller . $action . $url;

Much elegant solution.

Now it's really elegant solution.

You need to specify the route with your pages:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    page2 = Zend_Navigation_Page::factory(array('route' => 'routeName', 'controller' => 'page',  'label' => 'New page', 'action' => 'new');


and then it should work. I've had success with this approach using the actions "index", "get", "post", "put", and "delete"; I haven't tried "edit" or "new", but both should work.

My application uses Zend\_Rest\_Route as default router. I don't think its because of undefined route name in Zend\_Navigation\_Page initialization.

Matthew, i checked that - solution you provided not working.

Found a solution for issue [ZF-7760](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7760). Please check.

1. Are you absolutely sure you're using a REST route?
2. Have you tried specifying the route in the page, as Matthew suggests?
3. If none of the two above work out for you, could you provde minimum code required to reproduce the bug?

sorry for the hiatus everyone. busy having a baby. ;)

is this still an issue? reading the comment backlog, I can't tell if Matthew's solution worked or not, and I've never used Zend\_Navigation. can someone write a test case that replicates the way Zend\_Navigation could/should use the route for pagination url's?

thanks.

It's been a few weeks now, so I guess this is not an issue anymore.

Alex: Could you provide a reproducable case?

So, after having a hard time to reproduce the behavior I was totally unable to. The code I used:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    error_reporting(E_ALL|E_STRICT);
    
    require_once 'Zend/Navigation.php';
    require_once 'Zend/View.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Navigation/Page.php';
    require_once 'Zend/View/Helper/Navigation.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Controller/Front.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php';
    
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRouter()->addDefaultRoutes();
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->setRequest('Zend_Controller_Request_Http');
    
    $navi = new Zend_Navigation();
    $page = Zend_Navigation_Page::factory(array('controller' => 'page',  'label'    => 'Pages'));
    $page2 = Zend_Navigation_Page::factory(array('controller' => 'page',  'label' => 'New page', 'action' => '$
    $page2->setParent($page);
    $navi->addPage($page);
    
    $helper = new Zend_View_Helper_Navigation();
    $helper->setView(new Zend_View());
    
    echo $helper->menu($navi);


Therefore closing this issue as cannot reproduce. A next time you create an issue, please make sure to include _all_ relevant code, preferably in a way it can be tested in cli mode. Furthermore it's unclear what the expected outcome of your code is, making it all totally vague.

Thanks Dolf.

Hi Dolf, I think I'm experiencing the same issue. In your test you're not adding a REST route. Wouldn't that be why you can't reproduce the issue?

 

 

Posted by Rick Jones (r13ckj) on 2011-01-29T19:41:59.000+0000

Ah! My issue was slightly different - I was using post action in nav conf. Now I understand more about how REST routing works in Zend Framework, I've figured it out. There doesn't appear to be an issue here. As Matthew said it might be a problem by not declaring routes in nav conf.
