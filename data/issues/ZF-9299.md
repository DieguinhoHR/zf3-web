### Description

The error message from Zend\_Mail (as an exception message) reported as:

Command

Actual error message from server:

502 Command not implemented

Zend\_Mail error message:

Access

Expected error message:

530 Access denied

If this is intentional, then maybe the documentation is incorrect as there is no mention of this.
