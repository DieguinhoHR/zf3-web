### Description

There's nothing wrong with Jira (in fact, most like it) but its timeouts ands response times of over 2 minutes are a bit big. Please fix it :D

The best fixes for this are to either get more memory and/or switch to a different ticketing system.

I've noticed that the performance is worst during the time that the largest number of contributors are on line -- which tells me that we have a load issue. Unfortunately, this is not something that can be fixed in a trouble ticket,but something I need to get budget and or resources allocated for.

Marking as incomplete, as the status is not resolved, still clearly an issue, but not something to resolve via this channel.
