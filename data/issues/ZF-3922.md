### Description

Prior to 1.6.0RC2 sanity check packages, the following route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    routes.article.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route"
    routes.article.route = "blog/articles/:id"
    routes.article.defaults.controller = blog
    routes.article.defaults.action = articles
    routes.article.defaults.id = 0
    routes.article.reqs.id = "[0-9]+"


would match both '<http://localhost/blog/articles/2000/>' and '<http://localhost/blog/articles/2000>'; currently, only the latter route now will match.

Does a unit test cover this case yet?
