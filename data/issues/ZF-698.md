### Description

There are some methods with Zend\_Session\* that must be called before any output has been sent the browser. However, the messages thrown with the exceptions lack sufficient information to help people reporting "problems". The messages read, "Zend\_Session\_Exception: You must call this method before any output has been sent to the browser ...".
