### Description

In the Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp is an minor issue. If you Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp::send() a log event of style 'TRACE', it can happend, due the 'traceOffset' truncating, that the first element of returned trace array has no information about the 'class' and the 'type'.

To fix this, handle $trace[0]['class'] and $trace[0]['type'] as optional information -> e.q. $trace[0]['file']
