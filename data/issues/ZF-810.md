### Description

nick@pixelnix.com writes:

In preview 0.7, there seems to be an issue with extending Zend\_Db\_Table with Adapter\_Oracle as the default adapter. When \_setup() calls its $adaptor->describeTable() method, for the Oracle adapter it retrieves some rows using Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle->fetch() [Zend/Db/Adapter/Oracle.php, line 188]. Those rows are returned arrays directly from a call to oci\_fetch\_assoc, I think, but I know for sure that the array keys are all upper-cased. Since the loop body immediately following [lines 189 thru 194] read array keys in lower-case, the returned array is totally empty.

Does anybody on this list hack on Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle and Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle? If so, is this really a bug - I don't immediately see any way to affect the behavior other than changing those array keys to uppercase.

If nobody is working those classes, I'd be happy to contribute. Cheers,

Nick

This is fixed,

All is uppercased, the result also, same in other adapters. I think that it could have been simpler to just lowercase array keys of the result set and leave the rest intact, now the code is backward incompatible...

So be aware that everyone that have used this function till now should update his code.

This was fixed by the rewrite of describeTable() in revision 3093.
