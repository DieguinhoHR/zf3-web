ZF-11544: Memcache seems to be offline
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-07-08T17:36:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-31T14:07:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Sometimes, with memcache activated, it seems the memcache server is down.

An exception is thrown each times the problem occures "Can\\'t get filling percentage."

The problem is in Zend/Cache/BackendMemcached.php The function php function getExtendedStats() is buggy and sometimes return false, even if memcache servers are online. The bug is declared here : <http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=22158>

If you can have only one memcache server, you can use this patch : //$mems = $this->\_memcache->getExtendedStats(); $memsStats = $this->\_memcache->getStats(); $mems = array($memsStats);

This problem can be reproduced by using the TwoLevel backend and memcached as the fast one. Then when there is no memcached server available you get the following error: {quote} Exception 'Zend\_Cache\_Exception' with message 'Can't get filling percentage' {quote}

The problem and fixed it like this:

    -            Zend_Cache::throwException('Can\'t get filling percentage');
    +        if ($memSize === null || $memUsed === null) 
    +        {
    +          $memSize = 1;
    +          $memUsed = 1;
    +          $this->_log('Can\'t get filling percentage', Zend_Log::INFO);
             }
     
             return ((int) (100. * ($memUsed / $memSize)));


This will return a 100% filling percentage if the memcached server is not available.

@Iwan As you said, your patch returns 100% if memcache does not respond, even if memcache _is not down_. With your solution, you think the disk is full, and your application will generate errors. You really have to know when there is a problem or not.

Workaround for this is just not restarting Memcached. Wipe your cache using the API functions.
