ZF-8696: Add a option to set which locales are accepted
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2010-01-03T08:27:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-08-07T07:51:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

A option should be added to set the locales which will be accepted.

Usecase: Expect that a application is available in 4 languages. "en", "de", "fr".

By setting the allowed locale to this 4, and by providing a fallback a developer could easily control which translations will be given.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resource.locale.allow.0 = "de"
    resource.locale.allow.1 = "en"
    resource.locale.allow.2 = "fr"
    resource.locale.default = "en"


Now when a browser sends "fr", "fr" should be set. But when a user sends "it", "en" should be set as "it" is not allowed and in this case the fallback has to be used.

Thomas, do you have any idea when you can implement this feature?

A feature which adds a equal functionality has been added. See ZF-10911 and GH-315.

Zend\_Translate uses now the users browser settings to add "default" routings. When a language is not provided then this routing will not be used and the next language which the user has set is checked.

Therefor this feature request is closed.
