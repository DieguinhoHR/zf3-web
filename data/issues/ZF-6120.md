ZF-6120: Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap Folder Delimiters
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-24T12:54:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:47.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

createFolder() only uses a default delimiter of "/".

1) Documentation in the Reference Manual section "31.14.7. Using folders" states: bq. "The format for maildir is as defined in maildir++ (with a dot as default delimiter)"

2) As stated in the createFolder() "TODO" comment, shouldn't the delimiter be determined automatically? At minimal, can the programmer be allowed to specify the folder delimiter, e.g. Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap::setFolderDelimiter('.'); ?

Thank you for all the great code. Chaz
