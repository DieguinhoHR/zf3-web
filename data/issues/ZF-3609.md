Here's an example of how Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_ListEntry::getDom() looks before and after these functions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getDOM($doc = null)
    {
        $element = parent::getDOM($doc);
        if ($this->_accessLevel != null) {
            $element->appendChild($this->_accessLevel->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
        }
        if ($this->_color != null) {
            $element->appendChild($this->_color->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
        }
        if ($this->_hidden != null) {
            $element->appendChild($this->_hidden->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
        }
        if ($this->_selected != null) {
            $element->appendChild($this->_selected->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
        }
        if ($this->_timezone != null) {
            $element->appendChild($this->_timezone->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
        }
        if ($this->_where != null) {
            foreach ($this->_where as $where) {
                $element->appendChild($where->getDOM($element->ownerDocument));
            }
        }
        return $element;
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getDOM($doc = null)
    {
        $element = parent::getDOM($doc);
        self::setDomChild($element,$this->_accessLevel);
        self::setDomChild($element,$this->_color);
        self::setDomChild($element,$this->_hidden);
        self::setDomChild($element,$this->_selected);
        self::setDomChild($element,$this->_timezone);
        self::setDomChildren($element,$this->_where);
        return $element;
    }

Suggested guard clauses and convenience functions, as patched against the 1.5.2 release

Darien,

Thanks for this patch. Much cleaner this way. One thing that may be even better is to just have a

 
    
    self::setDomChildren($element, $value)
    


method that takes an array as an argument. This way we can pass a single element with value or an array.

Let me know what you think Thanks - Jochen

I suppose. The only problem there is the behavior when the second argument is null.

If you're setting a single item, it means "missing", and means it should be skipped. If you're trying to do an array, it'd be an outright error.

Just musing here... what if your second argument is an object which implements getDom() but also has an array interface implemented? is\_array() will differentiate between them handily, but it may not be clear which behavior is desired.
