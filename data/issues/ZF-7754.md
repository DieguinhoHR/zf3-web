### Description

I think a very nice and important feature would be to add e.g. Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Local which would be used for speaking to a local Zend\_Soap\_Server.

The use case for that is Unit Testing. If you have a Webservice you would like to unit-test, you would want to speak to it which happens through HTTP, but given the CLI environment of unit tests execution, this won't be straight forward, IMHO the solution to that is the hereby suggested Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Local which can speak to an instance of Zend\_Soap\_Server directly.

In php.net, "Example #1 SoapClient::\_\_doRequest() example" is pretty similar: [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.dorequest.php)

This functionality is already implemented:

Use the class: Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Local
