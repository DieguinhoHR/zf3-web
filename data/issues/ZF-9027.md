### Description

Zend\_Validate\_PostCode is validating invalid postal codes as defined by Canada Post. Locale: en\_CA

For Example "A0D 1A1" is invalid, but Zend\_Validate\_PostCode treats is as a success.

Reasoning: the Letters D, F, I, O, Q, U are not valid in a postal code in any location. Additionally, the letters W, Z are not currently used as an initial character

Example Code $pc = new Zend\_Validate\_PostCode(array('locale'=>'en\_CA')); var\_dump($pc->isValid('A1D1A1'));

Expected Result bool(false)

Actual Result bool(true)

"The alphabetic characters, D, F, I, O, Q, U, are not in use at the present time." StatsCan PCCF Reference Guide, p 32.

Unicode defines the postalcode for the locale CA with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [ABCEGHJKLMNPRSTVXY]\d[A-Z][ ]?\d[A-Z]\d


When this pattern is not correct, then please fill in an issue within unicode (<http://cldr.unicode.org>) as ZF is build upon the unicode database.
