ZF-9810: Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase uses unnecessary magic \_\_get, masking coding errors

### Description

For some reason, ControllerTestCase uses \_\_get() and a switch statement instead of distinct methods to provide access to a small handful of member variables. This is arguably an abuse of \_\_get(), but more importantly it suppresses any PHP errors that would result from accessing an undefined attribute in a test case. Test cases should fail loudly if anything is out of place, so this behavior is counterproductive.

I want to agree with Chris. I just got through a day-long debugging sessions in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase because all I got were errors similar to "Failed asserting X is Y".

I have a smallish patch that I'm working on to fix though. Will share later today/tomorrow.

I disregarded my patch and wrote [a custom listener for PHPUnit instead](http://github.com/till/Lagged_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase_Listener#readme).

I guess that's the cleaner way until someone improves this.

Also have a blog post explaining it: [http://till.klampaeckel.de/blog/archives/…](http://till.klampaeckel.de/blog/archives/116-Debugging-Zend_Test.html)

To install it, get it from PEARfarm: [http://pearfarm.org/till/…](http://pearfarm.org/till/Lagged_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase_Listener)

Till -- how does your listener address the OP's problem, exactly? From what I can see, it simply listens for error conditions, and, when found, adds some output (very useful output I might add!) to the buffer. While this can help you to analyze the test conditions a bit more, it doesn't really address the idea of addressing unknown attributes. That said: care to contribute the listener to the framework? I think it could be an invaluable addition. :)

Chris: would raising an InvalidArgumentException (or similar) in \_\_get() for unknown values solve the issue you're seeing for now? We can't really remove \_\_get() or the logic it contains in the ZF1 branch, as this would be a BC break. However, introducing the exception seems an appropriate compromise.
