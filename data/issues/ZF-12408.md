ZF-12408: BBcode renderer can't render string with incorrect brackets

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">$bbcode = Zend_Markup::factory('Bbcode');
    echo $bbcode->render('poijgsz;oih [ioda hgij [gdsjag;acheck [url=<a href="/url">http://google.fr]link[/url</a>]  [b]formatted text[/b]  [i]this is italics[/i]');


will render

```

of course, this text is malformed because some brackets are opened without being closed. But I don't understand why in that case, these brackets aren't just displayed like that and the rest of the text rendered correctly.
