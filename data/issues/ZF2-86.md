ZF2-86: Calling $this->render('...') from within a layout script erases layout variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If you call $this->render('somescript.phtml') from within a layout script, the layout variables are erased. Calling something like echo $this->raw('content') later in the layout script results in an empty string being echo'd.
