### Description

I needed support for enumerations, so I've prepared a patch. It can be useful.

Example class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @enum
     */
    class MyEnum
    {
        const EnumValue_0 = EnumValue_0;
        const EnumValue_1 = EnumValue_1;
        const EnumValue_2 = EnumValue_2;
    }


[Patch](http://lysik.pl/zf/patches/DefaultComplexType_Enumeration.patch)

[DefaultComplexType.php](http://lysik.pl/zf/patches/DefaultComplexType.php.txt)

Is there any way to upload patches?

Hi,

I already did some work on that, I recommend you just look at it : <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9180>

I also did a proposal on the developper wiki.

It should be helpful for you.

Hi!

I initially created this ticket as a sub-task of that one, but I don't know why they both wasn't connected.

I'll check the proposal on the wiki.

Thanks!
