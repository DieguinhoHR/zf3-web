### Description

if you've a varchar(50) field in a table, describeTable() method will return that the field type is "varchar(50)" instead of "varchar" width length = 50

in the code i can see some "@todo" comments but this task is very simple to complete because you can simply copy the code of the mysql adapter

hi and thank for the fix but this is only partial, cause it doesn't care about

'SCALE' => null, // @todo 'PRECISION' => null, // @todo 'UNSIGNED' => null, // @todo

ok reading the sqlite3 documentation it seems that it doesn't have unsigned data thus the "unsigned" index of the describetable could remain NULL

i created a patch to solve the problems above, it's been created agains r7686 do you think it could be added soon?

225,227c225 < list($length, $scale, $precision, $unsigned, $primary, $primaryPosition, $identity) < = array(null, null, null, null, false, null, false);

< 'UNSIGNED' => $unsigned,

Unfortunately, I cannot use your patch until you have signed a [Contributor License Agreement](http://framework.zend.com/community/contribute), but I think I can figure it out independently. Once you've signed the CLA, you can work on just about anything you like! Please consider it. :)

i didn't know about the CLA, i'll do that but it you can take a look at the patch cause anyway it's really simple

Please check out [SVN r7728](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=7728), and let me know if this resolves the issue for you. Thanks! :)

 

 

Posted by Fabrizio Balliano (balliano) on 2008-01-31T09:07:48.000+0000

ok thank you, seems to work fine! :-) i think you can close the bug

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-01-31T09:11:10.000+0000

Excellent! I'll mark this as fixed for the next minor release until I merge the changes over to the release-1.0 branch, so they can be in the upcoming 1.0.4 release, too. :)

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-01-31T09:43:07.000+0000

Fixed for 1.0.4 with [SVN 7730](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=7730).
