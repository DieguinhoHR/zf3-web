ZF-2764: Incorrect conversion to user-specified format: a year is added
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-29T09:42:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-29T10:42:11.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Date converts incorrectly some dates using user-specified format. This happens only by the last day of some years (2007,2008,2011,2012,2013)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('31.12.2007', 'dd.MM.YYYY');
    echo $date; // Dec 31, 2007 12:00:00 AM
    echo $date->get(Zend_Date::ISO_8601); // 2007-12-31T00:00:00+01:00
    echo $date->toString('YYYY-MM-dd'); // 2008-12-31

No, this is not a problem... You said that you want to have the ISO Year instead of the real year.

This is normally used when you want to calculate calendars. Week 1 of the Calendarsheet 2008 begins with 31.December.

If you need to have the real year, you should define it within your userformat.

"Y" = ISO-Year "y" = Real-Year

As this is the 5th issue where users are using the specifiers in a wrong way I added a note about the year specifier for future problems.
