ZF-5829: The documentation for Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Fault::attachObserver is faulty.

### Description

The documentation for Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Fault::attachObserver states that this function takes a class name for a class that has a public static method (observe) that accepts an exception as argument. The argument passed to the observe is an instance of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Fault. Even though exception is spelled with lowercase 'e' and it doesn't say that it is the class Exception this is confusing.

Sollution: Change the documentation to state that the function observe should take an instance of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server\_Fault as it's sole argument.
