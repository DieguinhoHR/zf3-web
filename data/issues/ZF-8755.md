### Description

I have some problems with uncorrect filtering of not well formed html data in Zend\_Filter\_StripTags. For example if you passing data in bad format like (without trailing quones for attribute values) you'll get tag without any params.

Can provide my solution with fix if it necessary.

Zend\_Filter\_StripTags relies on fully formed HTML that MUST have all attributes quoted. A lack of quotes is forbidden for security reasons and such attributes silently deleted from any output as a result.

May you point me what security reasons can be used to not allow to output tags with not quoted attributes? I not see anything that can be done with not quoted attributes and not done with quoted. I will be grateful if you explain little more. Thanks.

You should look into PHP's manual for a description:

[http://at2.php.net/manual/en/…](http://at2.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php) {quote} Warning Because strip\_tags() does not actually validate the HTML, partial, or broken tags can result in the removal of more text/data than expected. {quote}

Closing as won't fix

Broken and bad tags are always stripped for security reasons as mentioned. This filter is not intended to correct tags. Therefor we recommend Tidy, HTMLPurifier or Wibble for example.
