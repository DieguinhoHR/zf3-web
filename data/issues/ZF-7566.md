include/require must be needed? or can be autoloded?

I guess most Zend/App\* files dont have require\_once's because Zend\_App is dependent on autoloading:

"It also takes care of setting up the PHP environment and introduces autoloading by default." [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.html)

Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract can be autoloded, so include/require method is not needed.

> Zend\_App is dependent on autoloading.

You are perfectly right, nevertheless, lazy loading still has an effective cost and should remain the end user's choice.

As far as I'm concerned, I use to load "libraries relations" (for instance: extended class when defining the extension class) using require\_once and to use lazy loading when using these classes/libraries.

Autoloading is generally cheaper than calling require\_once explicitly, particularly when it comes to library code such as ZF; this is the reason why we recommend stripping require\_once calls and enabling autoloading within our performance guide. Leaving require\_once statements in leads to issues where multiple files call require\_once on the same class file(s) -- leading to a performance decrease due to multiple stat calls being made. (If you don't believe me, do some profiling and benchmarking sometime -- it's eye-opening.)

While I understand your reasons, the fact of the matter was that Zend\_Application was designed from the ground up to use autoloading -- the constructor of Zend\_Application instantiates autoloading. As such, we chose not to place require\_once statements in the various Zend\_Application sub-components.
