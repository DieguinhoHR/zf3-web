### Description

No mailing list archive is evident for fw-docs@lists.zend.com. When this is added it should be synced with the effort in ZF-135

Adding the same type of archive I created for the fw-general list.

Reassigning from Jayson to Bill Karwin, pending further triage.

My understanding is that all mailing lists are now archived and indexed at nabble.com, except for the new list "fw-gdata" that was created to handle issues related to the Zend\_Gdata component. Nabble needs to be notified to index that list.
