ZF-11183: Objects in JSON arrays are returned as stdClass when cast to array
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In PHP 5.3, ext/json returns strictly stdClass objects. As such, Zend\\Config\\Json attempts to flatten these so it may convert them to Zend\\Config\\Config objects. Unforunately, this appears to fail when you have an JSON array of JSON objects:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "someKey": [
        { "nestedKey":"value"}
    ]


The value of "someKey" gets returned as an array of stdClass objects in this case.
