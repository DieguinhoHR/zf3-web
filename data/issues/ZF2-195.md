### Description

I'm trying to use tablegateway to insert values in a mysql' spatial column: <http://pastebin.com/K6ECz0h4> but there's no way not to quote the "points" column, in ZF1 we had the Zend\_Expr but I can't find anything like that in ZF2.

Same issue applies to Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Insert Thank you very much!

Please can someone with the correct privileges assign this to component Zend\\Db

This is probably fixed by [https://github.com/ralphschindler/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/ralphschindler/zf2/commits/feature/db-sql-expressions) if you "use Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Expression" and then do

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "point" => new Expression("GEOMFROMTEXT('POINT({$_REQUEST["lat"]} {$_REQUEST["lng"]})')"),


I'm hoping those changes will be merged into the master branch for Beta4.

I'll look into this today, I think it's a good idea.
