### Description

Problem is initially reported by Jan Pieper in an FW-General:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: [fw-general] problem using Zend\_Search\_Lucene

I´ve big problems by using Zend\_Search\_Lucene after the update to version 0.2.

$index = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene('/var/www/html/private/app/lucene', true);

I get Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception with this message:

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception caught: fopen(/var/www/html/private/app/lucene/segments): failed to open stream: No such file or directory

The directory /var/www/html/private/app/lucene/ extists (after running the script). Changing chmod to 777 and running the script again does not function. I´ll get this exception again.

Whats up? Why this does not function?

Changing component to Zend\_Search\_Lucene.

Thanks Bill! I've forgotten this. It's already too later here :)

Seems it was fixed with moving to the Lucene 2.1 index format support.

Index lockless processing and index clean-up improvements are finished with the latest Zend\_Search\_Lucene commits.

Please re-open issue if problem still exists.
