I need a lot more information than this in order to proceed. Please provide details of your application setup -- include\_paths, what your basic application structure looks like, etc.

My hunch is that the ZF installation is not on your PHP include\_path. Please look at the quickstart guide, in particular the page on creating your project ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.create-project.html)), as it details where to put your ZF install and how to ensure the include\_path is correct.

Closing; re-open if you can provide reproduce information.
