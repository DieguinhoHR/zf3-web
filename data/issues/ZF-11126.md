ZF-11126: Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate ignores "Application wide locale"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I was having trouble when using "Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate". When debugging this class, I realized it doesn't use "Application wide locale" set on Zend\_Registry. I thought it would use because based on what doc says about app wide locale:

"Then this instance will be used within all locale aware classes of Zend Framework..."

and on Zend\_Locale docs, it says that Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate is locale-aware.

It's a bug, isn't it?

Zend\_Locale\_Format is not really a locale aware class. It is a sub-class which works based on the input from Zend\_Locale.

For 1.x it is not possible to archive this functionality but 2.0 will support this in a different way.
