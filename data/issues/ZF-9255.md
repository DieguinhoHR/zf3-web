ZF-9255: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv missing unicode support
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-24T08:48:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:31.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Current version of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv doesn't support to query unicode characters (i.e Japanese) in the database without prepared statements. As upddate(), delete() and fetchAll() methods don't support "real" prepared statements (str\_replaces are done in the methods) it's not possible to support unicode characters.

The problem lies in the \_quote method of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv, as it doesn't quote to a unicode string. Microsoft SQL Server requires an prepended N to recognize unicode strings. So a query with japanese characters has to look like this: SELECT \* FROM myTable WHERE myColumn = N'[japanese characters]';

So \_quote method should also prepend the N for unicode characters. For this also the Zend\_Db\_Statement \_stripQuoted method has to be adjusted as this only works with a single quoting character, which also has to be the same at start and end.

We created this patch to fix this problem. It prepends the required N and extends \_stripQuoted to also handle this kind of quoting.

We hope this helps to fix that bug in one of the next releases.

This patch could be OK, but what about prepared statements? I still can't get my unicode strings with db->update or db->insert methods

Support for real prepared statements would be great, but is not part of this bug.
