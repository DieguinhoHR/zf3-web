### Description

Chaining does not work with the normal Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route when wildcards are used

/user/:id/:action/\* does not work because getMatchedPath() from the route is not returning the right matched path. It ignores the wildcard...

Fix is here: $matchedPath .= $path[$i] . $this->\_urlDelimiter;

on Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route match()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    // If it's a wildcard, get the rest of URL as wildcard data and stop matching
                    if ($this->_parts[$pos] == '*') {
                        $count = count($path);
                        for($i = $pos; $i < $count; $i+=2) {
                            $var = urldecode($path[$i]);
                            if (!isset($this->_wildcardData[$var]) && !isset($this->_defaults[$var]) && !isset($values[$var])) {
                                $this->_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? urldecode($path[$i+1]) : null;
                                $matchedPath .= $path[$i] . $this->_urlDelimiter;
                            }
                        }
                        break;
                    }
