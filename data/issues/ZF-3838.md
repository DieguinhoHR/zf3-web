### Description

On:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.placeholder)

The $conditionalStylesheet is referred to as a boolean rather than a string or false.

"The $media value defaults to 'screen', but may be any valid media value. $conditionalStylesheet is a boolean, and will be used at rendering time to determine if special comments should be included to prevent loading of the stylesheet on certain platforms."

Usage example is:

$view->appendStylesheet("styles.css", 'screen', 'lt IE 7');

Which outputs:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    Used as a boolean it would simply output:
    


Should be updated to reflect that the primary use is to pass a string, but you could pass the boolean value of false.
