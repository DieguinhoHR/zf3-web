### Description

The fetchAssoc() and fetchPairs() methods in the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract class have incorrect return types noted in their docblocks: the descriptions of both methods state that they return arrays (which they do), but the return type noted in the @return tag specifies that they return strings.

Patch for library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php to correct the noted docblock issues.
