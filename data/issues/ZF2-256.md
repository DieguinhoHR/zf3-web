### Description

In my app, i have two modules :

ModOne and ModTwo. Each modules have directory 'view' in module directory with scripts. In each module, i have one controller IndexController with an action index.

In Mod1 config :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack' => array(
                    'parameters' => array(
                        'paths'  => array(
                            'mod1' => __DIR__ . '/../view',
                        ),
                    ),
                ),


In Mod2 config :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack' => array(
                    'parameters' => array(
                        'paths'  => array(
                            'mod2' => __DIR__ . '/../view',
                        ),
                    ),
                ),


First literal route "/mod1" route to Mod1 index/index. Second literal route "/mod2" route to Mod2 index/index.

But, with the zf2, the Zend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack, the resolve method get the first which matched. But, two paths are good : Mod1/view and Mod2/view.

So route "www.exemple.com/mod1" route to Mod1 controller and display Mod1/index/index. So route "www.exemple.com/mod1" route to Mod1 controller BUT display Mod1/index/index, not Mod2/index/index.

I know why, because Zend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function resolve($name, Renderer $renderer = null)
    {
            [...]
    
            foreach ($this->paths as $path) {
                $file = new SplFileInfo($path . $name);


The two paths are valid, because there is "index" directory in each modules, and an "index" script in each modules.

Alias, namespaced controlle name or setPaths() of Zend\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack can resolve problem, but why can we add this native comportement ? ZF1 to ZF2 migration can be hard because developer use lot of IndexController name ?

I think the task of Evan Coury "Create "default" module route"in the board should be fix that
