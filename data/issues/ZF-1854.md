ZF-1854: Regexp Router does not match valid URL ending with '/' character
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-08-15T14:54:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-09-16T10:14:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When directing browser to URL such as: <http://example.com/blog/category,example,1/> Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex does not match the URL with regexp defined (in config file) as: blog/category,([^/]_),(\\d+)/ exactly: routes.blogCategory.route = "blog/category,([^/]_),(\\d+)/" Router trims ending '/' character of path (line 69 of Zend/Controller/Router/Route/Regex) thus URL can not be matched with defined route. To fix the bug, please replace following code of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex class (starting at line 69):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $path = trim(urldecode($path), '/');


with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $path = urldecode($path);
    if (strlen($path) > 0 && $path[0] == '/')
        $path = substr($path, 1);

It's designed to work that way, Wojciech. Simply omit the trailing slash while defining your routes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    routes.blogCategory.route = "blog/category,([^/]*),(\d+)"


PS: attn. Matthew - remember our little chat about ltirm which was used there in the beginning? That's what it was there for - to give developers more control over URI schemas. But it's easier this way for those remaining 80% who doesn't care if their URLs are suffixed by slash or not.
