### Description

I often find 90% of my forms are instantiated like this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array('action' => '/some/action/url/path'));


Any chance we could get the constructor slightly modified as below

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($options = null)
    {
        if (is_string($options)) {
            $options = array('action' => $options);
        }
        
        // the rest is unmodified
    }

You can always extend Zend\_Form in your own library to provide this logic, and then extend that class in all your forms. :)

We won't do this in ZF, however, as it's unclear what a string argument would be: \* the form name? \* the form action? \* the form method? All three of those values are strings, and any one of them may be a default condition you want to set.

Ah, but the form action is the only required HTML attribute. Anyway, extending the class is exactly what I'm currently doing.
