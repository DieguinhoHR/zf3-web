### Description

Zend\_Currency variables should be protected, not private. Currently they are all private so the class is not extendable at all, thus useless for advanced usage.

Not all of these variables are allowed to be protected. There is a reason why some variables are private.

I was already reworking the whole class. Now I have to rework my already made changes which have taken two days.

Please ask always before reassigning any issue already assigned to another person. Thank you.
