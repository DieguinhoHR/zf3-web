ZF-3813: URL delimiter in route is only '/', should also be '.'

### Description

When using routes i'd like to have one like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Static:staticUrl.htmlshopindexstatic

But the '\_urlDelimiter' variable in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route contains only '/' character, so the route is not exploded as expected (not to 'staticUrl' parameter and suffix, but to 'staticUrl.html' parameter). I don't know if it's bug or 'feature'.

Assigning to Martel to triage.

This is by design. I'm planning to rewrite Route object (for Route chaining) so this will work without any effort on user part. But for now you have to extend the route and override \_urlDelimiter, Tomas.

OK, from the code it's just what I expected, I just want to "let know" about this. As long as that some people can be upset by this not working... ;)
