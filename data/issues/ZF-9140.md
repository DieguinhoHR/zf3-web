### Description

In the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract class the function setOptions evaluates if the variable $file is equal to null (which it retrieves from the \_getFiles function). However the value returned fron \_getFiles is always an array, so this statement is always inherently false.

This hampered me severely in my attempts to upload a file with the magicFile set. I "fixed" it by checking if the sizeof the variable was larger than 0 or not...
