### Description

Hi there,

Whether I provide an array of primary keys or a single integer Zend\_Db\_Table::find() returns all the rows rather then just the one(s) specified.

This actually work fine on a prod server using 1.7.2 but in development using 1.7.5 it is definitly broken.

For info, this was experienced while using an Sqlite3 db.

PS: I haven't look at the unit test cases for this method.

Cheers, Franck

Apologies, this was an internal error our end. The Zend\_Db\_Table::\_where() was wrongly overloaded in one of our model which caused this aforementioned bug.

Much apology for the false alert -- if you could please shut this report.

Great framework.

Cheers, Franck
