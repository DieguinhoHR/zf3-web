ZF-1546: Missing require\_once call to load Exception class in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-06-11T12:34:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:18.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.0 (30/Jun/07)

### Description

I've encountered the following error when working on a Zend Framework MVC application I build:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Class 'Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception' not found in /home/shahar.e/Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php on line 263


This is of course not the expected behavior - it looks like a call to require\_once is missing.

A fix patch is attached.

Fix patch, adding the require\_once call to load the exception class.
