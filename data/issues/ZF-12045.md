Where did you come across this link? Example blocks in the documentation pages are not sections, and so cannot be linked via anchors. You can link to the section which contains the example like so: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.adapter.html#zend.db.adapter.connecting.parameters)
