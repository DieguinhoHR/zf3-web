I don't understand. In the last SVN revision (6679, 23/10/07) of the "Sqlite.php" file, there is :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    if (!extension_loaded('sqlite')) {
            Zend_Cache::throwException("Cannot use SQLite storage because the 'sqlite' extension is not loaded in the current PHP environment");
    }


in the constructor.

so, it's ok, isn't it ?
