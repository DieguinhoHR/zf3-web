ZF-11324: Example in docs throws a warning in constructor on PHP 5.3

### Description

The following example from official docu-site [0](a%20rel=) ends up with a php-warning:

Code: $d = new \\Zend\_Date('13.04.2006', array('date\_format' => 'dd.MM.yyyy'));

Warning: defined() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /usr/share/php/libzend-framework-php/Zend/Date.php on line 155

After studying the source code, i think the documentation is not right at this point.

The following example works perfectly:

$d = new \\Zend\_Date('13.04.2006', 'dd.MM.yyyy');

it seems for me, the date-format must be a string, an array with named options is not wanted here.

So only the documentation should be changed. Regards, Hagen

The attached docu page is from Zend\_Locale and not from Zend\_Date. The given parameters work for Zend\_Locale but for Zend\_Date only the first parameter is allowed to be an array.

Hi Thomas, thanx for reply.

you're right, but the docu has still the wrong example code using an array as second parameter for Zend\_Date (and this is the point i told you from):

Line 7: $dateObject = Zend\_Date('13.04.2006', array('date\_format' => 'dd.MM.yyyy'));
