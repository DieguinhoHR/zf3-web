### Description

I often find it useful to refresh a row from the database. Can we either make the \_refresh() method public (it is currently protected) or can we make a public refresh() method which executes the protected \_refresh() to preserve BC?

Is this going to make it into 1.0.3? I have commit access to Zend\_Db, can I commit this to the trunk at least?
