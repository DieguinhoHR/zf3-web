Adding helper methods and tests to make setting and getting the yt:recorded element easier in revision 11761.

We have support for all v1 and v2 functionality as of ZF 1.7.2 so I am resolving this issue. A few minor details are missing such as extension elements for yt:statistics that were recently added. Separate issues have already been created for those.
