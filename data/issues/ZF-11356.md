### Description

I'm using ZF with Doctrine which is using PHP 5.3 Namespaces. I want to encode an object using Zend\_Json's embedded encoder. This encoder adds a '\_\_classname' to every object which contains the get\_class() value of the object. This results in malformed JSON because the backslashes aren't encoded properly.

Example: Encoding a class A\\Entity\\Foo is saved as {"\_\_classname":"A\\Entity\\Foo"} without encoded backslashes. The correct encoding is {"\_\_classname":"A\\Entity\\Foo"}.

My local workaround is a str\_replace('\\', '\\\\', get\_class($value)) around the get\_class() call.

I've attached a fix implementation and unit test to cover it.

I wasn't sure what the proper procedure was for using namespaced classes inside of ZF. What I did was create a new PHP file tests/Zend/Json/\_files/Zf11356-NamespacedClass.php with this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    namespace Zend\JsonTest\Zf11356;
    class NamespacedClass extends \ArrayIterator
    {}


Then tested the PHP version in the unit test, and if it was >=5.3 require\_once'd the above file and carried on with the test.

Is this a good approach?
