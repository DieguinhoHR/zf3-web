ZF-685: Wikification: Illegal sorting of TOC
--------------------------------------------

### Description

Within the wikification the table of content and the child pages are sorted per name. But they should always be presented in the order they are written in the docu.

Example: Within Zend\_Measure the chapters are not sorted as expected. They seem to be thrown together.

Instead of Introduction -> Writing -> Creation

it displays Introduction -> Creation -> Edit

This autosorting happens by Confluence, and I can not control how the pages will be sorted. One possible solution might be to number the pages/chapters, but this will make it more difficult to maintain, if we will ever convert wiki back to docbook.
