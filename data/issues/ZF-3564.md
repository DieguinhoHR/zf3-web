ZF-3564: Incorrectly Formatted MBox File causes PHP Fatal Error (Out Of Memory)

### Description

If Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Mbox attempts to read a message in a mbox file that is incorrectly formatted it can result in a Out Of Memory Error. This occurs when Mbox passes a value < -1 to stream\_get\_contents in Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Mbox::getRawContent() which is interpreted as a very large value to read. The negative value is passed in because the value is determined from end - start positions, and in my case the incorrect format caused end to be less then start, causing a negative value.

The following code will reproduce this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    set_include_path('ZendFramework-1.5.2/library/' . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
    require 'Zend/Mail/Storage/Mbox.php';
    $mbox = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Mbox(
            array('filename' => 'test.mbox')
            );
    foreach($mbox as $msg) {
            echo $msg->getContent();
    }
    ?>


With the Following MBox file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    From example@example.org Thu Jul 3  09:38:37 2008
    Subject: From Problem
    From: "Example" 
    To: 

From on a line should be >From

Can't reproduce. What's your OS, PHP version, extensions, ..?

This issue is related to ZF-4007. I think if no values smaller than -1 are passed to stream\_get\_contents() both issues should be solved.

Error handling on those memory issues are probably platform dependent, and therefore hard to reproduce.

Why don't you format the mbox file correctly?

\_openMboxFile() of Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Mbox.php requires the Mbox file has CRLF on its end of lines as following.

Possibly is the end of lines in Mbox file only CR or LF?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strpos($line, 'From ') === 0) {
        $messagePos['end'] = ftell($this->_fh) - strlen($line) - 2; // + newline
        if (!$messagePos['separator']) {
            $messagePos['separator'] = $messagePos['end'];
        }
        $this->_positions[] = $messagePos;
        $messagePos = array('start' => ftell($this->_fh), 'separator' => 0, 'end' => 0);
    }
