ZF-11210: Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry docblock mismatch

### Description

The PHPDoc block for Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry::setEnclosure includes @param array $enclosures.

The actual parameter is named $enclosure (no 's').

Aside from the wrong name being misleading, it causes the generated API docs to claim that `setEnclosure` takes two arguments.

The new DocBlox generator seems to deal with the mismatched arg names better; it doesn't show two arguments like the old phpDocumentor docs did.

The mismatched names are still causing the generated docs to not correctly show that the $enclosure arg is an array.

Fixed in ZF2 with [GH-402](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/402)
