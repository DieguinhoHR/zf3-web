### Description

While the Amazon.com "itemLookup" api method allows a CSV list of up to 10 ids for the ItemId parameter, itemLookup() ignores multiple results, returning only an item only when $items->length == 1.

Amazon's API documentation describe the value of ItemId as the "Product IDs": [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceServâ€¦](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/2005-10-05/ApiReference/ItemLookupOperation.html)

Fixed, will now return a ResultSet if more than one item is returned. However, all ItemId's must be Amazon ASIN's, this is a restriction on the REST API as I see no way to specify seperate IdTypes unless that to should be a CSV, in which case just pass it in as an option :)

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
