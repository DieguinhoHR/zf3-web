### Description

Hi,

ive tested the Amazon\_S3 StreamWrapper and this works fine. But now, i would like to realize a direct Upload to the Amazon Storage, but to Upload a file, Zend\_File checks the Destination Directory and this won´t work with the StreamWrapper.

$s3 = new Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3(\*\*\*\*\*) $s3->registerStreamWrapper("s3"); [...] $adapter = new Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http(); $adapter->setDestination('<a>s3://test-test-f/</a>'); ( The bucket exist, checked with S3Fox. I also grant all rights in the ACL to everyone. )

This throws an exception, that the destination is not a directory.

Did i make a mistake or it is not implemented yet ?

I´ve found the Issue.

There is a Problem with the backslash in the "\_getNamePart" function.

I cant use this: "is\_dir('<a>s3://test-test-f</a>)" cause the index "path" is undefined.

But when i use this: "is\_dir('<a>s3://test-test-f/</a>')" the function return 2 slashes. string(12) "test-test-f//" and url\_stat wont work.

The main problem, that i cant use is\_dir() is, thats the mode is not set. ($stat['mode'] = 0;)

Quote from cellog at php dot net 13-Apr-2005 04:45 :

"url\_stat() must define mode, or is\_file()/is\_dir()/is\_executable(), and any of those functions affected by clearstatcache() simply won't work. It's not documented, but directories must be a mode like 040777 (octal), and files a mode like 0100666. If you wish the file to be executable, use 7s instead of 6s. The last 3 digits are exactly the same thing as what you pass to chmod. 040000 defines a directory, and 0100000 defines a file. "

the slash issue should be already fixed and I've checked in the fix for is\_dir issue.

This is still an issue. It look like we are not able to directly upload to S3. \* The url\_stat() code to detect folder/bucket vs. file often mix up: \*\* Example : '<a>s3://bucketName/subfolder/</a>' result in a file mode '<a>s3://bucketName/file</a>' is converted to 'bucketName\\file' which result in a folder mode because '/' is not the Windows DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR

So query return error 404 most of the time.

file\_put\_contents('<a>s3://BucketName/SubFolder/item.html</a>', $data); work correctly so i will manualy update the file until it is fixed.
