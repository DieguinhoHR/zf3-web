ZF-11746: Allow defining charset separately from Content-Type in Response object
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2011-09-16T12:19:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-05T23:14:15.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently you cannot control the charset of a response object separately from the content-type header.

This leads to the following issues:

- A component like AutoCompleteDojo defines its own content-type header, overriding any default you/apache provide
- As a result, the response contains no charset information, causing browsers to default to their own default encodings
- As an end result, character display issues can occur

Suggested fix:

- Provide a way to define charset separate from content-type.
- The response, when sent, would then combine these two values to produce the correct response header

This is possible at this time in ZF2 via the Zend\\Http component. In ZF1, this is a much more difficult prospect, as header management is done ad-hoc via arrays in the Response object -- meaning that we'd need to add a variety of switch statements to make it work (a code smell).

good to hear it works in zf2. I discussed this shortly on irc with robert, so maybe he has some solution

Can we consider this a "Won't Fix" for ZF1?
