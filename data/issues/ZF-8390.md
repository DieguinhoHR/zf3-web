### Description

Zend\_Pdf\_Action\_URI is currently an empty class. From looking at the format specs, it is my understanding that implementing this class is what is required in order to have links to external content (e.g. web pages). I believe this is a commonly used feature in PDFs - it certainly is in my organization.
