### Description

At the moment the format and the timezone of the timestamp in the log is hardcoded (date('c')).

This is very unattractive because of at least two reasons: 1. It is not possible to change the format e.g. to see milliseconds for performance profiling in the log 2. It is not possible to have a log with UTC timestamps even if the web application has other locale settings.

My recommendation is to give the possibility to assign a Zend\_Date object to a Zend\_Log object (or even better to a Zend\_Date\_Formatter object) which defines format and timezone for the log.

There is no Zend\_Date\_Formatter class... you can simply set your wished format with toString($format); or a convinient method if any of the standard formats is used.

Details on implementation when having problems can be asked in the I18N mailing list.

How would this be implemented? By passing an instance of Zend\_Date in the constructor of Zend\_Log? By passing an instance of Zend\_Date on every invocation of log()? Is there any need for the flexibility to log with different date formats using the same Zend\_Log object as provided by the second proposal?

I'm waiting for a response from the reporter. Thomas, do you think this is a worthy change? I'm postponing for now since this won't be fixed in the next few weeks unless a community member steps up.

Sorry for my late response... I was somehow disconnected from the watch list.

There are several ways: We could add a 'dateformat' option where you could define "yyMMDD" for example to get that format as date within your logs.

I don't know Zend\_Log details but only when Zend\_Log allows to use a self defined time/date we could add the possibility to attach a Zend\_Date object as date/time to use. Otherwise we would overwrite the actual date as the user could with Zend\_Date give a completly other date than wished.

Still there are two things to mention: First: Components should be loosly coupled... so the default behaviour should still be to use date('c') and only when configured/given within the options to use Zend\_Date

Second: I think this idea should be written in a own proposal as there are several other advantages/disadvantages which have to be thought of.
