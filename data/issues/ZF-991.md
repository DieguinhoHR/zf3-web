ZF-991: Circular 'require\_once' calls for Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common

### Description

When you try to include the 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common' class file, the require\_once path will require the file itself again, resulting in the file not loading properly.

Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common.php requires Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php requires Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common/Utf8.php Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common/Utf8.php requires Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common.php

To prevent circular require statements, one should only require classes directly required by need. In this fashion the Analyzer class should not require the Common/\*.php classes.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer class uses leafs of hierarchy.

It's actually only one class (Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_Text\_CaseInsensitive), but any other may be used. So it needs circular require\_once().

Whole hierarchy has to be used through including Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer.php';


It guarantees all files are loaded/parsed in right order. (I've just corrected example in the documentation)

I don't think it's obvious you must require Analyzer.php instead of the class to use. You know <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2456> is posted from the same origin.

I am not sure if Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer REALLY needs leafs of hierarchy, but if it does, the change like the following would fix the problem.

- Move require\_once's at the beginning of Analyzer.php and put them into the new file (name it A.php).
- Analyzer.php and all leaf classes SHOULD requires A.php instead of the classes to use.

In short, odd things (requiring the non-obvious file) should be done by the framework, not by the frame work user.
