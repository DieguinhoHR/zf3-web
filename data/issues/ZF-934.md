### Description

This is a very minor ZF coding standard issue, but affects svn diffs when we remove the 0x0d characters and then commit patches.

I do not recommend removing the 0x0d characters from library/Zend/Locale/Data/\*, since that would result in "svn update" sending the entire CLDR data set. Instead, I would purposely leave the 0x0d characters in these data files, and remove them when upgrading the CLDR data set (whenever this is done).

Not only the I18N components had 0x0d delimiters included.

I reverted the line delimiters for all files within the framework from windows (0d 0a) to unix (0a) as declared within coding standards.

SVN 3574 to 3583

For those using bash-compatible shells, here is a trick I use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    alias fixtabs="find . -path '*/.svn' -prune , -type f -a -name '*.php' | xargs sed -i -e 's/\r//g' -e 's/\t/    /g'"
    alias fixtabsx="find . -path '*/.svn' -prune , -type f -a -name '*.xml' | xargs sed -i -e 's/\r//g' -e 's/\t/    /g'"
