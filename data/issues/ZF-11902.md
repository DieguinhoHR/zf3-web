### Description

Unit test suite in ZF SVN trunk does not work with PHPUnit 3.4.x any more.

Progress Made: \* Convert usages of assertInstanceOf to assertType [Fixed r24563 r24676(MWOP) r24680] \* Convert uses of assertEmpty to assertTrue(empty(...)) [Fixed r24564 r24565]

TODO: \* Merge above into release branch

From: Update library and test suite to be compatible with PHP 5.4.0RC1 To: Update test suite to be compatible with PHPUnit 3.4.x again

Thats quite something different than what i voted for :)

Just a question, wich version is the desired version? (I hope phpunit-3.5 vor ZF1 and phpunit-3.6 for ZF2)

Yeah, sorry about that...I accidentally committed PHPUnit 3.4.x-related fixes against this ticket. Instead of backing them out of SVN and re-committing I just changed the purpose of this ticket and opened another for the PHP 5.4 fixup (ZF-11906)
