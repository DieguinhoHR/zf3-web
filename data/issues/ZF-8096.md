### Description

The following code shows three attempts to create a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_DateTextBox using a dojox.widget Calendar as popupClass.

The MonthAndYearly Calendar works fine!

The YearlyCalendar is displayed correctly too. But after selecting a value nothing happens with the DateTextBox - it stays empty.

I've added a markup version as third attempt to demonstrate that the Widget by Dojo itself seems to work fine.

Can't tell if it is a major Dojo problem with the popupClass in a DateTextBox or if it is caused by the Zend\_Form\_Element.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?= new Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_DateTextBox(
        'monthAndYearly',
        array(
            'dijitParams' => array(
                'popupClass' => 'dojox.widget.MonthAndYearlyCalendar'
            )
        )
    );
    ?>
    <?= new Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_DateTextBox(
        'yearly',
        array(
            'dijitParams' => array(
                'popupClass' => 'dojox.widget.YearlyCalendar',
                #'popupClass' => 'dojox.widget.MonthAndYearlyCalendar'
            )
        )
    );
    ?>
