### Description

Hi.

Can I access the headers in the soap-reauest, so I may use them in the handling class? I'm thinking of the content of the tag inside the root tag of the reuest, not the HTTP-request headers obviously.

This component proposal: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20109) even mentions this ability, and has a usecase using a server->setReadHeaders(true), but none of this exists in the current 1.10 version, or am I severely mistaken?
