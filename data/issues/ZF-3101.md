### Description

After running phpunit on the tests/AllTests suite from the trunk, I get the following test results on PHP 5.2.5 on Linux:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    1) testRegenerateId(Zend_SessionTest)
    Zend_Session_Exception: The session has already been started.  The session id must be set first.
    /var/local/zf/tests/Zend/Session/SessionTest.php:126

There was a problem with already started session.

Some other tests (Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_FlashMessengerTest and Zend\_OpenId\_Provider\_User\_SessionTest) utilize Zend\_Session to their own needs, session may already be started at testRegenerateId() pass time.

Changes also merged into release-1.5 branch.
