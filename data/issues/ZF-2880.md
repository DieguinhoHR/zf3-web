### Description

The method _validateIdOrTag() should only allow [a-zA-Z0-9_]. However, the preg\_match() call misses the D-modifier and therefore also trailing newlines are allowed. This might not be the biggest problem on earth as I couldn't find any real attack scenario but this should be fixed anyway.

Fixes the newline injection by adding the D-modifier.

probably no real attack scenario possible

I'm assuming this fix is merged to the 1.5 release branch for release with 1.5.1. Please update JIRA if this is not the case.
