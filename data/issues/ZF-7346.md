### Description

Zend\_Service\_Twtitter seems to be rushed a bit, as it has multiple coding standard violations, for example in some places no space after beween "if" and the opening brace, or some variables not named properly (e.g. $in\_reply\_to\_status\_id, instead of $inReplyToStatusId).

I believe that the only CS violation left was the variable name. I will fix and get this in place.
