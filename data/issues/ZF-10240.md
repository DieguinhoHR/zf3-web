### Description

As stated on ZF-10220 i think is trivial but useful to add also a way to cleanup all the caches handled by Zend\_Cache\_manager with only one single call.

Please use the new method getCaches:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($manager->getCaches() as $cache) {
        $cache->clean();
    }
