This failure is already fixed within trunk.

You'll have to wait for a new release, or use trunk as we can't edit a already released version.

We are using trunk ;-)

The test above is an _additional_ unit test that _fails on the trunk_ of two minutes ago (14046). It exposes a different failure.

The difference with the failure that was fixed in 5735 seems to be that this event falls within DST.

I added exactly this unittest with r14048 as I've done it locally before. Still this unittest does not fail. I can't reproduce your problem.

Maybe you mixed trunk with release by your includepath.

Enter the twilight zone:

I have checked out 14060 and ran phpunit Zend/DateTest.php, and _there are no failures_.

Now, I've stripped all testXYZ() functions from DateTest leaving only the testTimezoneArray() function. Stripping and running reproduces the error.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    There was 1 failure:
    
    1) testTimezoneArray(Zend_DateTest)
    expected string <2009-08-28T22:00:00+02:00>
    difference      <         xxxx>
    got string      <2009-08-29T00:00:00+02:00>
    
    FAILURES!
    Tests: 1, Assertions: 5, Failures: 1.
