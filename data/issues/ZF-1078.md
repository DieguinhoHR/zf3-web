Fixed with SVN 4070.

Although the fix applied works around differences between the comparison function in PhpMath.php and BCMath's bccomp(), is there any reason to avoid fixing PhpMath.php by adding support for precision, so that the behavior of PhpMath.php is more compatible with the BCMath functions?

Not exactly a "duplicate", but pertains to .. (same fix).

Zend\_Locale\_Math is a helper class for the locale framework to avoid problems with not installed BCMath extensions.

There is no need of doubling the complete BCMath extension. Only the needed functions for the I18N core should be coded. As there is actually no need of adding precision to comp I would avoid it until we are in need.

Although I dont understand what this has to do with this already fixed and closed issue...
