### Description

The comments for Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface claim that getItems-method should take $pageNumber as its first parameter. However, every adapter implementation and paginator itself use $offset as their first parameter.

Adapter\_Interface method declaration and documentation read as follows: /\*\* \* Returns a collection of items for a page. \* \* @param integer $pageNumber Page number \* @param integer $itemCountPerPage Number of items per page \* @return mixed \*/ public function getItems($pageNumber, $itemCountPerPage);

While they should be something along the lines of: /\*\* \* Returns a collection of items for a page. \* \* @param integer $offset Offset from which to start displaying items \* @param integer $itemCountPerPage Number of items per page \* @return mixed \*/ public function getItems($offset, $itemCountPerPage);

Nice catch. This is a holdover from pre-release versions where page number, not offset, was used here.

This issue was already fixed, but apparently not closed...
