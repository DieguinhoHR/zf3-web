Added a patch, I have only implemented these methods having not seen any immediate need or value for anything more at this time.

Thanks Robert in which version will the patch be included can't see in 1.11.11. I usally have the zf as an svn external, which makes it hard to patch.

What version of PHPUnit are you attempting to use? The highest officially supported version is 3.4.x, but personally I've been using 3.5.x without any significant problems. However, 3.6 is completely unsupported, as there were BC breaks introduced with that version.

Was unaware of 3.6 unsupported until after the fact.

@Adman as you can see here 3.6.4 is the durrent stable version: <http://pear.phpunit.de/> That ist the version I use.

@Adman as you can see here 3.6.4 is the current stable version: <http://pear.phpunit.de/> That ist the version I use.

Torsten -- please read Adam's comment in full. PHPUnit 3.6.4 introduces many BC breaks, and we are unwilling at this time to spend the time necessary to address them in ZF1 (when we addressed 3.4 -> 3.5 for ZF2, it took around a week of dedicated time to cleanup the test suite to work). As such, we're standardizing on the version of PHPUnit that was current during most of its development lifetime -- PHPUnit 3.4.X.
