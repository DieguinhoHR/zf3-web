### Description

Adding a class attrib to a html form element using setAttrib stops setRequired from adding it's required css class.

I suggest we have an addClass or setClass method onto the form elements. This would keep a list of css classes being added to the html element, during the render it would explode this list with spaces and possibly use setAttrib with the new list of css classes.

This is actually simply broken logic in the decorator; will fix for GA release.
