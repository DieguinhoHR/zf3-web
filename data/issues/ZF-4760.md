ZF-4760: Zend\_Pdf::newPage method does not accept Zend\_Pdf\_Page object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-31T04:09:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-15T14:06:02.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Due to a check on both $param2 and $param3 being null in the constructor of Zend\_Pdf\_Page, the parameters passed from Zend\_Pdf::newPage can never work with a Zend\_Pdf\_Page object parameter (used this way to use an existing page as a 'template').

This can be triggered by:

$pdf = new Zend\_Pdf(); $template = new Zend\_Pdf\_Page(Zend\_Pdf\_Page::SIZE\_A4); $page = $pdf->newPage($template); //error is thrown

I believe the manual states this is possible.

the manual does not state this is possible, the API does not do it either.

you have to do:
