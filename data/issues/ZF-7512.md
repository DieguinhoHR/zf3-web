ZF-7512: Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup getId() does not honor ids set via setAttrib().
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-08-06T15:09:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:19.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If you set an id on a display group, the id will not be honored. For example:

$group = new Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup('foo', new Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader); $group->setAttrib('id','bar'); echo $group->getId(); // prints 'foo'

The bug lies in Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup::getId(). The getId() method checks a non-existent instance member 'id'. It should check for an id element in the attribs member instead.
