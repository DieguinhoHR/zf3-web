ZF-1385: Indirect modification of Zend\_Session\_Namespace::$namespace has no effect
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-05-15T01:37:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-04T11:15:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When I use the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $messenger = $this->getHelper('FlashMessenger');
    $messenger->setNamespace('login');
    $messenger->addMessage($message);


I get the following notice:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property Zend_Session_Namespace::$login has no effect


As a result, the message never gets added to the array. The attached patch fixes this.

This problems occurred in PHP 5.2.0.

Exactly the same problem here, with exactly the same php version ... I found exactly the same patch :)

I use ZF-1.0RC1

I think this issue is one in the same.. I am trying to find a good test case to apply across different php versions, please see linked bug.
