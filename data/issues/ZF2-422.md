ZF2-422: RouteNotFoundStrategy not configurable
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2012-07-26T10:10:20.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:05.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently (RC1) there is no way to set the parameters of Zend\\Mvc\\View\\Http\\RouteNotFoundStrategy. The strategy is created without using config parameters (unlike the ExceptionStrategy) in the ViewManager.

Enabling exceptions is very helpful for debugging puposes.

Actually, you can set the display\_not\_found\_reason and not\_found\_template under the 'view-manager' configuration. What we cannot do currently is set the 'display\_exceptions' configuration. I'll add that for RC2.
