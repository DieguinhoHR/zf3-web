### Description

- zf create db-table/model/form, etc

While these generate the appropriate classfiles, they do not prepend them with the appropriate namespace.

"zf create project" defines the appNamespace key with a value of "Application" as we discussed. However, this namespace is not being prepended to the classes in the default module -- instead I get "Model\_DbTable\_Guestbook", "Model\_Guestbook". If I try to use "zf create db-table guestbook guestbook application", it tells me there is no "application" module, and fails.

I'm not sure how to resolve this, but if the default module is going to use the prefix "Application", the zf command needs to use it.

I've fixed the problem adding the namescape option in application's bootstrap file.

Regards

<?php

class Bootstrap extends Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap { protected function \_initRequest() { $options = $this->getOptions(); $this->getApplication()->setAutoloaderNamespaces(array($options["appnamespace"])); } }

This seems to be fixed in 1.10.5. When I create a model, form, db-table classs, the "Application\_" prefix is added automatically. Issue could be closed.

For me still doesn't work, i've simply created a class with the right name (Application\_Class), in the right folder and try to instantiate it, but doesn't work.

What I did was the following:

zf create project whatever cd whatever/ zf create db-table Users users

In whatever/application/models/DbTable/Users.php then I have the class Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users. In the IndexController::indexAction() method I just add

$users = new Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users();

When I run the project on <http://localhost/whatever/public/> I do get an application error which says "No adapter found for Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users" and indicates that Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users is loaded.

So, can you reproduce this? And does this still not work for you in 1.10.5?

Reproducing your instructions the result is correct: the same of your.

But my problem is different and maybe is caused by my misunderstanding, this is my situation:

- i've an application created by "zf create project test"
- In the folder that i've the "Zend" library folder i've created a folder "Application" that will my namespace for custom classes
- I've created a test classes named Application\_Test in the "Application" folder
- In my "application.ini" file i've the directive appnamespace = "Application"
- In my IndexController::indexAction() i would try to instantiate a class contained in the "Application" namespace without require it: $at = new Application\_Test();

So i've an error: the class can be found.

But if i add following lines in \_initRequest() application's Bootstrap file

$options = $this->getOptions(); $this->getApplication()->setAutoloaderNamespaces(array($options["appnamespace"]));

the class is founded and correctly instantiated.

But maybe this is not the correctly usage...

Regards

Yes, I think there is a little bit of misunderstanding in this issue. The namespace "Application" is used for all files in your default module of your project directory test/application/. The name for this namespace is set via the directiv "appnamespace".

If you want to extend the Zend library folder with you own extensions of the framework, you should use a different namespace. For example you create the directory test/library/Peter and therefore use the namespace "Peter". Then you should add the following directive to your application.ini:

autoloadernamespaces.Peter = "Peter"

You should rename your class to Peter\_Test and this should be autoloaded.

If you want to use "Application" for your library extension you should configure a different name for the classes in your default module:

appnamespace = "Whatever" autoloadernamespaces.Peter = "Peter"

But you have to make sure that your models, forms, db-tables, etc. in your default module have the class prefix "Whatever\_" to be autoloaded.

Does this clarify and solve your problems? If yes, could this issue be closed?

Yes, my problem is solved, i've added the autoloadernamespaces directive and the problem doesn't exists anymore.

So thanks a lot for your help, and excuse me for the misunderstanding on the issue :)

Best regards

Can be closed due to a misunderstanding of the reporter (see discussion).
