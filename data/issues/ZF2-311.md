### Description

Zend\\Filter\\Compress\\Tar::decompress() return boolean, and it can not return other stuff, so the assert always fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $content = $filter->decompress($content);
    $this->assertEquals(dirname(__DIR__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . '_files' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $content);

I have open the story #53 in AgileZen to register the need of refactor this component.

The story is actually in the backlog waiting for a RFC.

I have updated the Tar::decompress() method to at least return the value expected by the test and the CompressionAlgorithmInterface. At least we can have a passing build in the meantime pending story #53 without having to mark a test as skipped.

The code to test has been fixed and the rest of the tasks will be updated in the mentioned story.
