ZF-8091: Zend\_GData\_Apps could implement singleton...

### Description

I'm using Zend\_GData\_Apps as my main authentication mechanism for the application and I am reusing that object later on to manage Google Apps Domain. Currently, however, there is no method to store the persist the authenticated GData object (at least I didn't find any way apart from keeping the object in Zend\_Session). It would be quite ok to keep it the session, but the thing is that in the object you have a clear text user/password combination to the service. I think google relies on an authentication token, and that this can be forgotten for later on requests.

You can extract the authentication token from the Zend\_Gdata\_Apps object, and then store that.

I'd prefer to avoid singletons whenever possible. What if a user wants to interact with two accounts simultaneously?

I'm going to close this as Won't Fix.

I'm okay with that, then the class could provide a clear method for extracting the authentication token or a serializing method to save in the session. What do you think?

This is already implemented.

See Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient::getClientLoginToken() and getAuthSubToken():

Thanks for that. I'm just wondering now... it would be quite ok just to store the whole Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps object in session after authentication, provided that the password would not be stored in Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps::$\_httpClient::$paramsPost and lastRequest. So, maybe after successful authentication, it should do: Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps::getHttpClient()->resetParameters() and Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps::getHttpClient()->setLastRequest(""); // this method does not exist

what do you think?
