### Description

Possibly related to: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2448>

Occasionally (at seemingly random intervals), performing a query throws an exception such as, File '/search/lucene\_index/\_30\_j.del' is not readable

If you look at the structure of /search/lucene\_index/, there is a \_30\_k.del file but no \_30\_j.del file. It appears the delGen is being incremented incorrectly occasionally possibly.

The exception is raised from Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_SegmentInfo line 303. $delFile = $this->_directory->getFileObject($this->\_name . '_' . base\_convert($this->\_delGen, 10, 36) . '.del');

For a temporary, quick fix, I have modified Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_SegmentInfo to touch the file before it attempts to getFileObject. 303 $delFile = $this->_directory->touchFile($this->\_name . '_' . base\_convert($this->_delGen, 10, 36) . '.del'); 304 $delFile = $this->\_directory->getFileObject($this->\_name . '_' . base\_convert($this->\_delGen, 10, 36) . '.del');

I have reproduced this bug in 1.5.1 and 1.5.2

This is a really bizarre bug. Indexing fails in the same place every time, and it's not dependent on the particular item being indexed, it's dependent on when it is indexed (e.g., the 720th item (just an example) fails no matter what the 720th item actually is). This isn't a memory issue as far as I can tell.

It should be noted that I have also reproduced this bug with a checkout of trunk at revision 10001.

Got the same bug here. It's weird... I have an app that's been live for over a year without problems. Only when I moved it to a new VPS this problem started to show. Would optimizing the index regularly prevent this bug from occurring?

Could you provide full stack trace for the exception? There are two different situations where the problem may occur (opening index and updating index just updated by another process).

I've encountered this issue before with our internal ZF app (also at seemingly random intervals). I can't seem to comment on the issue, though, so I'm posting a stack trace here (with some potentially sensitive info masked).

Hope it's useful.

Thanks for the stacktrace Aaron, I don't have one sitting around anymore.

Alexander, if there are two possible situations, shouldn't we address both of the possibilities? Since the issue was appearing at seemingly random intervals for myself and others, we can't guarantee which one of the two conditions are occurring.

Aeron: Thanks!

Josh: There are two places where Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_SegmentInfo object is created using already existing index segment. I don't see what is the cause of the problem now, so stacktrace helps to define where the problem actualy appears.

I found where the problem was.

Segments updating (which may happen if some documents were deleted) and segments\_xxx file updaing were performed separately. So there was a lack for index updating lock. It may cause the floowing actions sequence:

process1 performs segments updating and writes new del file _30\_j.del -> process2 performs segments updating and writes new del file \_30\_k.del -> process2 performs segment updating and writes new segments\_xxx (with the latest del file generation k for segment \_30) -> process1 performs segment updating and writes new segments\_xxx+1 (with the latest del file generation j for segment \_30) -> process1 performs index directory cleanup and deletes all \_30_\*.del file excepting the last -> latest segments\_yyy refers del generation for segment \_30 as \_j, but index folder doesn't contain \_30\_j.del file => index is corrupted, exception is thrown.

Fixed for the trunk, release-1.5 and release-1.6 branches. Will be included into ZF 1.5.3 (should come within a week).
