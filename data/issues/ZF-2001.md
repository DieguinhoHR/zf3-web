Hmm, though I would write "a useful way," "an" may be the proper article, as it precedes a vowel sound, as in "an historic occasion." I don't know for sure. :)

Assigning to [~matthew] to initiate issue review.

Hmm. I don't know, I'm not a native englishspeaker but I feel it a bit annoying with "an", but possibly just becouse in Hungarian the written letter and pronunced sound is exactly the same, so there's no problems like this. But IMHO it's reasonable to suppose that pronunciation decides, since spoken language is earlier than written.

Of course if somebody who's more highly qualified in English can confute me...

I've asked an english teacher about this, and said that the pronounced sound decides; so "a useful way" is the correct form.

Current grammar is correct; nothing to fix.

It isn't correct - as discussed on the lists.
