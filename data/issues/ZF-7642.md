ZF-7642: zf:extends does not appear to be an interchangable element

### Description

If you attempt to use zf:extends as an element with a zf:const included in the value, Zend Framework throws errors. Currently, if you try to use zf:extends as an element as you can with several of the other non-namespaced tags, Zend Framework will throw the following errors:

Version 1.9.0 (svn: tags/release-1.9.0) of the framework reported: "A node with a 'const' childnode may not have any other children"

Version 1.9.1 (svn: tags/release-1.9.1) of the framework reported: "Unknown node with name 'extends' found"

The first error is strange because it almost seems to work, but it detects children in the zf:const tag for some reason when there are none (below example is identical to my attempts and no children are present). This is true with explicit and self-closing tag arrangements.

- - - - - -

For example, in application.xml, starting with this base: ....definitions.... ....definitions....

Then trying to extend another definition based on a constant value: ....definitions....

Since there is no way to define a constant in an attribute tag, the only viable options to achieve this are to create a custom loader that appends the constant value in some way when loading sections and creating several custom sections for each custom constant-based environment, creating another segmented file for each constant container, or zf:extends needs to be allowed as an element in Zend\_Config\_Xml and allowed to contain a zf:const value. The example may be odd, but it does communicate the issue I'm currently experiencing.

The error message in 1.9.0 is strange, but it seems to be fixed in 1.9.1, so that is no problem anymore. The second error-message tho is correct, since there is no node "extends" within the zf-namespace. This is in fact a bad example, since you coul have achieved the same effect with a proper configuration-structure.
