### Description

On [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/en/zend.application.available-resources.html)

The issue is with: Example #18 Sample View resource configuration

Adding the resources.view.basePath ini setting to the value of specified as: APPLICATION\_PATH "/views/scripts" ; at the time of writing

will set the base path to APPLICATION\_PATH/views/scripts/scripts

The sample should be: resources.view.basePath = APPLICATION\_PATH "/views"

Note that this isn't necessarily a problem assuming someone has got his viewsscripts in APPLICATION\_PATH/views/scripts/scripts. Since this won't be the case however a lot, I just updated the documentation on trunk.

Thank you for reporting this issue.
