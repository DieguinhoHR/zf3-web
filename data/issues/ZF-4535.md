ZF-4535: Dojo Parser runs 2 times
---------------------------------

### Description

If we add to djConfig "parseOnLoad = true" and we use programmatic style, in the auto created addOnLoad method the parser is ran manually.

So the first time, when the dom is ready the dojo parser runs (due to parseOnLoad = true) and just after, the zend method run the parser again (auto generated method).

If you're using the view helpers to generate Dijits, simply don't add the parseOnLoad = true djConfig setting.

Is it specified in the doc ?

No, but I'll include a note.
