ZF-11212: 'link' array entry works differently for RSS and Atom
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The 'link' key in an array passed to Zend\_Feed::importArray() means different things for Zend\_Feed\_Atom and Zend\_Feed\_Rss.

The manual page says that 'link' is the 'canonical url to the feed'.

Zend\_Feed\_Rss, in \_mapFieldHeaders(), simply creates a element in the channel. The RSS 2.0 spec says this means "The URL to the HTML website corresponding to the channel."

Zend\_Feed\_Atom, in its corresponding version of the same method, creates a element, which, like the manual would indicate, is intended to be a canonical url to the feed.

If the manual's text is indeed the intended behavior, then it seems Zend\_Feed\_Rss is creating bad output. If Zend\_Feed\_Rss is doing it the "right" way, then it would seem that Zend\_Feed\_Atom should be creating a .

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
