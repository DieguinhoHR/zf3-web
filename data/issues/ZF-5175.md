### Description

Zend\_Form\_Element\_File#setRequired should require at least one of multi files, but it does all of them uploaded.

Zend\_Form\_Element\_File#isValid returns false When you call setMultiFile($count) and setRequired(true) for Zend\_Form\_Element\_File and you upload one file or files less than $count.

I think setRequired should check if one or some files are uploaded only. Otherwise you do not have a way to create file elements that you need to upload at least one file. Regarding the file count, you can use the Count validator.

$file = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File('file'); $file->setDestination($upload\_destination\_path) ->setRequired(true) ->setMultiFile($max\_file\_count) ->addValidator('Count', false, array('min' => $min\_file\_count, 'max' => $max\_file\_count));

I don't get the point.

When you set a element to required the element must be given. If not then not.

A multielement is always counted as one element for the form. There is no way to say "2 are required and 3 are not". Zend\_Form does not support this.
