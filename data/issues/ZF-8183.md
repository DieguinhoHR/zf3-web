### Description

Methods create() and isExists() are meaningless in context of Memcacheq due to it's approach to creating queues on-the-fly. Method getQueues() can only be implemented by opening separate socket connection and talking to Memcacheq server bypassing PHP's client library. Besides, the usefulness of this method is questionable due to the same on-the-fly approach.

While I understand that this means breaking backward compatibility at certain level, I would suggest to remove the support for these capabilities, because they can not be implemented consistently and efficiently, and they are in conflict with Memcacheq's nature.

We're making sure the adapters implement a common set of methods with the abstract classes.
