### Description

Files extracted from ZendFramework-1.9.0.tar.gz.

Running zf.sh show version, the output is:

~: zf.sh show version PHP Notice: Undefined index: STORAGE\_DIR in /opt/zend/ZendFramework/bin/zf.php on line 70 Zend Framework Version: 1.8.4

Correct is: 1.9.0

As previously described on ZF-7464, also shows unsetted index STORAGE\_DIR notice.

I believe you may have incorrectly installed Zend\_Tool, as in my fresh install, it shows 1.9.0 {quote} ryan@ryan-laptop:~/projects/test.com$ zf show version PHP Notice: Undefined index: STORAGE\_DIR in /usr/local/ZendFramework/bin/zf.php on line 70 Zend Framework Version: 1.9.0 {quote}

Check that you put the 1.9 lib on the correct include\_path for your CLI install
