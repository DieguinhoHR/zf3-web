### Comments

Posted by Goran Hacek (ghacek) on 2007-04-04T06:55:58.000+0000

There was a conflict with unit tests of Zend\_Service\_Akismet component, where that component was changing http adapter of Zend\_Service\_Abstract to Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Test which isn't compatible with Zend\_Service\_Delicious unit tests.

Resolved in revision 4343.
