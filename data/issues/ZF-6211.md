@Dolf: What should this issue bring ? Actually Zend\_Validate\_Identical is under Code-Review by Alex.

And even if he already needed more than several weeks, there is no reason to create a new issue which is attached to another person. When Alex is not captable to do this task it will be done automatically by another dev member.
