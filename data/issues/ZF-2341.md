### Description

The release of Zend\_InfoCard as a separate package (like Zend\_Gdata) requires some preparation. For example, the release build scripts need modification according to the required files and modification of the documentation and unit test master suites, and the website needs to be modified to accommodate the release package downloads.

Added due date under the assumption that this is required for 1.5.0 GA (i.e., not RC1). If this is not the case (i.e., the package is required for RC1), the due date should be 2008-02-22.
