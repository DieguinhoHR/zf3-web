This is not an issue. Zend\_Ldap::explodeDn() is a backwards-compatibility method. It has been in Zend\_Ldap from the very beginning.

During refactoring I moved DN-related functions to Zend\_Ldap\_Dn and named the method that checks if a given string is a vlid DN Zend\_Ldap\_Dn::checkDn(). As this is exactly the funtionality provided be the legacy Zend\_Ldap::explodeDn(), the latter only proxies to the former. Zend\_Ldap::explodeDn() is just kept for backwards-compatibility but is marked "deprecated".
