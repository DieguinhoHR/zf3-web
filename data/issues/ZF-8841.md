### Description

I have been playing with the Twitter part of zend framework,and I missed the ReTweets.

So I hacked the zend/services/twitter.php file so the public function statusFriendsTimeline references home\_timeline instead friends\_timeline and it works great for my needs. They are identical functions.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.service.twitter.html#zend.service.twitter.status)

I would like to see both methods supported.
