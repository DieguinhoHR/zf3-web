### Description

Assemble method of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route should use values submitted in a URL as defaults instead of throwing an Excpetion when variable is not defined as a parameter.

With URL of '<http://localhost/test/news/view/10>' and map defined as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute('news', 'news/:action/:id/*', array('controller' => 'news'));


Assemble should return 'news/edit/10' when called without id:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route->assemble(array('action' => 'edit');

Hi Michael

The current implementation is still not quite respecting the original route:

If I use:- route: /conference/view/ $params: array('id' => 1) $route->assemble($params) = '/conference/view/id/1' (which is correct)

However if I use: route: /conference/view/year/2000/month/3 $params: array('id' => 1) $route->assemble($params) = '/conference/view/id/1' (which is incorrect - my values for year and month are gone)

Yes, I know, Simon. The problem is in additional parameters which are not defined in a route. I may add this functionality to the assemble if someone comes up with a logical use case. And I mean real example.

As mentioned here by Tim Berners-Lee: <http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI> (thx Nick ;)

The URL of '/conference/view/year/2000/month/3' should really be stripped of unrelevant information making it look like this for example: '/conference/2000/3'. This does look clear, doesn't it? And RewriteRouter allows you to do that, you just have to define your route as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addRoute('conferences', 'conference/:year/:month', array('controller' => 'conference', 'action' => 'display'));


If you do $route->assemble('month' => 5) it will use a year value from URL.

The wildcard and additional params are not the correct and appriopriate way of using a RewriteRouter. This functionality is implemented primarily for backwards compatibility.

Oh, I forgot to explain the first paragraph. I don't really see the point of using wildcard parameters to represent this URL you gave in the second example. If you need to do that and OPTIONALLY provide an id, make the route definition like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addRoute('conferences', 'conference/:year/:<a>month:/id</a>', array('controller' => 'conference', 'action' => 'display', 'id' => null, 'month' => null));


This way, this single route will be able to match URLs like:

<http://host.com/conference/2000/3> (Params will be set to: year = 2000, month = 3, id = null) <http://host.com/conference/2002> (year = 2002, month = null, id = null) <http://host.com/conference/2002/5/14> (year = 2002, month = 5, id = 14)

I wasn't sure if the RewriteRouter was going to supercede the current implementation - that's why I am concerned that I can't still have the 'freedom' allowed by the current implementation. Being able to handle the baseURL and wildcard routes is reason enough for me to want to use the RewriteRouter, however not at the expense of freedom of being able to create the kind of URLs I want to use with my apps.

For example, in my cms, I may have any one of the following URLs to view a 'directory' of records:-

/admin/section1/directory/ /admin/section1/directory/sort/firstname /admin/section1/directory/sort/firstname/search/Simon /admin/section1/directory/sort/firstname/search/Simon/pg/3 /admin/section1/directory/sort/firstname/search/Simon/pg/3/pp/50

...and so forth...

Each of these are valid ways to view the page, but I may choose to click on 'view' to view a record. Now if my URL is suddenly rewritten as "/admin/section1/view/id/1" I suddenly lose all the criteria I have previously selected. Now if I use the above as advice, then it means I need to create a whole set of routes that may or may not need the same information.

I want my URLs - in certain controlled cases - to be 'buildable' to allow multiple filters/criteria.

The route ':controller/:section/:action/\*' makes sense for me to use, because I don't want to limit the kind of params I may or may not want to pass over to the controller depending on the context of that section. A view for a single record may have different requirements of a multi-record admin screen.

So I guess in my long-winded way I'm saying that I don't disagree that 'limited' routes should be the default, but I would really like to be able to apply a lot more freedom to these routes if I chose to. 'Cool URIs' aren't always practical, nor desirable depending on the end-use of the app.

Simon, you are free to use it any way you see fit. And you have the same freedom you had with the old router - RewriteRouter closly mirrors old router behaviour, so you can create URLs with parameters defined as you like. There is no expense or "you have to do it like that now" here.

But the issue is about how the new router implementation handles it's own url parameters (which have to be defined in the URL) in reversing the routes. You are referring to new router functionality in it's NEW assemble method which at the moment does not support old style parameter mapping fully. You still can use it with old style mapping but you have to provide it's parameters on your own.

So if you want those parameters to be mapped, you just have to provide them in an assemble call for now. It's still possible and easy but requires a bit more work on your part. With a route of ':controller/:section/:action/\*' it should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assemble('sort' => 'firstname', 'search' => 'Simon', 'pg' => 3);


And the code above will result in '/admin/section1/directory/sort/firstname/search/Simon/pg/3'

I will try to evaluate work needed in the assemble the wildcard variables but on a first look it seems pretty complicated (if you don't want the variables to be duplicated). Yet it's not a first priority for me right now.

Maybe someone could provide a working solution in form of a patch ready to be integrated?

I'll leave the issue opened for now but if I won't correct this before 0.2.0, I will be forced to close it.

This does a pretty serviceable job. The feature is off by default (to maintain compatibility) but can be turned on with a second boolean parameter - $build.

It's not so easy, Simon. If it was I would do it myself. It's not that I don't want it in the code :)

Look, we have a route of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $routes['archive'] = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('archive/:year/:month/*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show'));


An URL of:

<http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/05>

And a code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = $router->getCurrentRoute();
    $url = $route->assemble(array(), true);
    var_dump($url);


Which results in: string(46) "archive/2005/05/controller/archive/action/show"

And should be "archive/2005/05".

 

 

Posted by Simon Mundy (peptolab) on 2006-07-14T09:27:28.000+0000

It is working OK, though, judging by the above example. That's an expected behaviour.

If you wanted a strict 'archive/2005/05' then your route would be 'archive/:year/:month' (without the wildcard). Then 'controller' and 'action' aren't appended.

But since you've added the wildcard, you've lifted the constraints on the url and allowed those parameters through.

And because 'controller' isn't a defined :variable within the route, the logic is quite right in adding the new 'controller' parameter to the assembled URL.

As far as I can see, if you're going down the path (pardon the pun) of a specific route like:- /news/:year/:month/:article /archive/:year

then you're less likely to want a wildcard anyway. And even less likely that you'd want to add the 'true' parameter to the assemble() method.

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-14T10:33:48.000+0000

It's not expected because you're introducing variables which are already defined through defaults. And by defining a route like that I don't wan't my users to ba able to define an action and the controller in the url. And as that I also don't want them to see my internal implementation.

And what if I want also this functionality:

[http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/…](http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/05/sort/author) [http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/…](http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/05/description/show) [http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/…](http://test.nebula.intranet/archive/2005/05/description/show/sort/author)

?

Hi Michel - I've gone back to the drawing board and this time made a few test cases in order to bulletproof this example!

I've modified the Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::assemble() so that you can either build/replace the current params (in a wildcard example) or you can pass a 'true' flag to completely reset the url (see examples below).

The 'match()' method now gathers the 'explicit' variables from the url and stores in a protected $\_params array. This is merged with the defaults to provide the final match. However, for 'assemble', only the $\_params are used, meaning that 'silent' default variables are not returned for the assemble method. Both methods still enforce the 'no overwrite' principle, as shown below.

// Route 1 - Append 'id' to a wildcard route $route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('archive/:year/:month/\*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show')); $route->match('archive/2006/12'); echo($route->assemble(array('id' => '3')) . '  
'); // outputs archive/2006/12/id/3

// Route 1 - Append 'id', 'dir' and replace 'year' $route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('archive/:year/:month/\*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show')); $route->match('archive/2006/12'); echo($route->assemble(array('id' => '3', 'dir' => 'asc', 'year' => 2001)) . '  
'); // outputs archive/2001/12/id/3/dir/asc

// Route 1 - Reset URL, replace 'year' and 'month' and add 'filter' $route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('archive/:year/:month/\*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show')); $route->match('archive/2001/12/id/3/dir/asc'); echo($route->assemble(array('year' => '2003', 'month' => 10, 'filter' => 'active'), true) . '  
');

// Route 2 - Attempt to overwrite with bogus 'action', add 'id' $route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('archive/:controller/:action/\*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show')); $route->match('archive/2001/show/action/foo/action/bar'); echo($route->assemble(array('id' => '3')) . '  
'); // outputs archive/2001/show/id/3

// Route 2 - Attempt to overwrite with correct 'action', add 'id' $route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('archive/:controller/:action/\*', array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show')); $route->match('archive/2001/show/action/foo/action/bar'); echo($route->assemble(array('id' => '3', 'action' => 'email')) . '  
'); // outputs archive/2001/show/id/3

Simon, as I have said in a private mail - it's brilliant. But you have to tweak it a bit more because it doesn't pass one test - testAssembleWithWildcardUrlVariablesOverwriting. It's located in RouteTest on line 247.

After your change, router is overwriting 'controller' while it shouldn't. The rule is - if there is a default set without a variable in the url, users shouldn't be able to change it's value. And that's what those "array\_key\_exists($var, $values)" and "is\_null($values[$var])" are for. Url variables are stored in $this->\_vars, so you can use it for that task.

Please provide a patch as an attachment to the issue instead of pasting it in the comment body. It will help a lot :)
