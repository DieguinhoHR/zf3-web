ZF-1095: Allow other HTTP methods not in the RFC
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-03-20T16:09:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:58.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.1 (23/Mar/07)

### Description

Currently, Http\_Client only allows the 8 HTTP/1.1 compliant request methods. However, several protocols based on HTTP (such as HTTPMail used by Outlook to connect to Hotmail and DAV used by Subversion) require additional request methods.

Additionally, the RFC specifically allows servers and clients to extend the common request methods and use different, non-RFC ones.

Currently I don't see any reason not to allow the user to send HTTP requests using arbitrary methods.
