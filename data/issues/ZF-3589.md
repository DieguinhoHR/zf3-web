ZF-3589: add callback option as treatment to Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable has a database dependent way of specifying a treatment for the password. In mysql this could be PASSWORD(?), which won't work in sqlite. Instead of just an sql string, it might be nice to be able to specify a callback so a user can easily create rdbms independent solutions. It might also help with salting, etc.
