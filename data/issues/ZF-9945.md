ZF-9945: Zend\_Amf serializer generates NOTICE for Zend\_Db objects
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2010-06-03T13:07:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:36.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When serializing some Zend\_Db objects, the Zend\_Amf\_Value\_Messaging\_AcknowledgeMessage object representing that class throws the following error

Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property Model\_Census::$age has no effect in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Amf\\Parse\\Amf3\\Serializer.php on line 494

Silencing the line or setting the error\_reporting level to zero obviously work, but IIRC code is not supposed to show warnings.
