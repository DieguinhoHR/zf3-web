### Description

From Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       /**
         * get root folder or given folder
         *
         * @param  string $rootFolder get folder structure for given folder, else root
         * @return Zend_Mail_Storage_Folder root or wanted folder
         * @throws Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception
         * @throws Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception
         */
        public function getFolders($rootFolder = null)
        {
            $folders = $this->_protocol->listMailbox((string)$rootFolder);
            if (!$folders) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Mail/Storage/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception('folder not found');
            }


When mailbox pointed by $rootFolder is empty (has no subdirectories), it throws an exception. I reckon it should return an empty iterator instead.

The IMAP chat the code would result with:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    TAG2 LIST "INBOX.aaa" "*"
    TAG2 OK LIST completed


The IMAP implementation I was testing it against (courier) does not indicate errors if queried for inexistent folder

 
    <pre class="literal">
    TAG3 LIST "INBOX.this.does.not.exist" "*"
    TAG3 OK LIST completed


It is possible, though, to list the contents of the inbox by querying parent directory with an appropriate wildcard, and then parse the data.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    TAG4 LIST "INBOX" "aaa*"
    * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX.aaa"
    
    TAG5 CREATE "INBOX.aaa.bbb"
    TAG5 OK "INBOX.aaa.bbb" created.
    
    TAG6 LIST "INBOX" "aaa*"
    * LIST (\HasNoChildren) "." "INBOX.aaa.bbb"
    * LIST (\HasChildren) "." "INBOX.aaa"
    TAG6 OK LIST completed


Possible drawbacks I could imagine is having multiple directories matching the pattern resulting in unnecessary data being sent across the network & processed (in example above it would list all directories starting with aaa).

Other possible solution is to have two step process:

LIST "INBOX.aaa" "\*", then if empty, check whether the directory exists itself by doing LIST "INBOX" "aaa"
