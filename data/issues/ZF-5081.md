### Description

I am trying to create a select with currency and Im providing it a HTML entity for the Euro, which then gets encoded again

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
     $this->addElement('select', 'Currency', array(
        'label' => '/h',
        'multiOptions' => array('null' => 'Select...', 'EUR' => '€', 'GBP' => '£', 'USD' => '$' )
     ))


ouputs

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    Select...&euro;&pound;$

What Id like is to be able to switch escaping off perhaps. I can see the need to do this on a per option basis. Providing a Euro symbol does not escape to &euro;

Update : I found out how to do non formatted text so updated my example to be more accurate

Thanks :)

It would also be nice to render $nbsp; :)

Is it possible to use utf-8 in your application and then use the actual € and £ symbols just like the $ symbol?

Tell Zend\_View to use utf-8 encoding: $view->setEncoding('utf-8') if you want to use UTF-8 symbols directly.

As for the original reporter's issue, you can do this already. Pull the 'ViewHelper' decorator from the element, and set the 'escape' option to a boolean false:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $decorator = $multi->getDecorator('viewHelper');
    $decorator->setOption('escape', false);
