### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html)

This document links to [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.reflection.php) which does not exist (anymore).

It should link to <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php>.

When I need to find something, I usually (ab)use <http://php.net/reflection> which not only redirects me to a mirror, but gives me good results most of the time.

Patch looks ok, should be committed AFAICT.
