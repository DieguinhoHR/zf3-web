### Description

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server throws an exception "Calling parameters do not match signature" with base64.

Code to illustrate

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Enter description here...
     *
     * @param base64 $data
     * @return base64
     */
    
    public function setAvatar($data) {
        return $data;
    } 


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client(".");
    
    $avatar = array(
        'type' => 'base64',
        'value' => file_get_contents('avatar.jpg')
    );
    $response = $client->call("setAvatar", array($avatar)); 


From XML-RPC server we got error "Calling parameters do not match signature", and if we change @param base64 $data to @param string $data no error happens.

I've watched code, so here is my opinion on this Issue:

One part of issue is in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request, in loadXml method. It's parses XML to params (protected member $\_params) and saves them as native PHP array with native PHP types. So at this part information about base64 in RPC request is lost.

Second part of this Issue is in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server, in \_handle method. It's uses params array from Request (Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request, witch has native PHP types) and compares them with RPC method's Reflection data (where it has base64). Here we got this "Calling parameters do not match signature".

Possibly, fixing issue in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request->loadXml and tiny fixes for all Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request to store data about requested param's types should solve this issue, but I'm not sure about depended Zend\_XmlRpc functionality.

Fixed in trunk and 1.5 release branch

I'm assuming this fix is merged to the 1.5 release branch for release with 1.5.1. Please update JIRA if this is not the case.
