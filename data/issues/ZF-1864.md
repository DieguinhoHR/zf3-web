ZF-1864: Zend\_Db\_Profiler replaces bind variables

### Description

If you request the query params from the last executed query through the profiler, you get the following result.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(4) {
      [":train_id"] => string(4) "32"
      [":dep_station_id"] => string(7) "32"
      [":arr_station_id"] => string(7) "32"
      [":stage_id"] => string(2) "32"
    }


While it should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(4) {
      [":train_id"] => string(4) "8972"
      [":dep_station_id"] => string(7) "1000006"
      [":arr_station_id"] => string(7) "1000104"
      [":stage_id"] => string(2) "32"
    }


So, all values are replaced by the last value in the given array.

I found that the problem resides in Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Query::bindParam(). Currently it is written as this.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function bindParam($param, &$variable)
    {
            $this->_boundParams[$param] =& $variable;
    }


Removing the assignation by reference fixed this behaviour.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function bindParam($param, &$variable)
    {
            $this->_boundParams[$param] = $variable;
    }

I believe I found this mistake already and fixed it in [revision 6136](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Profiler/Query.php?r1=5401&r2=6136).

Would you be able to refresh your ZF library with the latest code in subversion and test this?

This code change is currently in the ZF 1.1.0 main development branch. We have a policy that code changes need to be reviewed before we can port them to the ZF 1.0.x branch. So if you review this code change I'll be glad to make sure it gets into the next ZF 1.0.x release.

wrong copy/paste.

You're correct, it is indeed fixed in the latest version on Subversion.

Applying a better fix in revision 6163.

Now we apply parameters at execute time, so we can support "bound" parameters. Not truly bound to a variable, but the value is copied at execute time, not at bind time. See unit test in Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_TestCommon::testProfilerPreparedStatementWithBoundParameters().

Applying an even better fix in revision 6170.

Updating Fix Version to follow issue tracker conventions.
