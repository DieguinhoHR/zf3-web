ZF-5411: Wrong behaviour of dispatcher when invalid controller found
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I think there is a bug during the dispatcher process. If there was an invalid controller detected, the controller is rewritten to "IndexController". Ok, that's what is expected. But the $request->param[{$\_actionKey}] in the request object is set to null also . So any call of the desired action failed after creation the default controller, because the in the $request-->\_param[$\_actionkey] does no longer exist .

Take a look at Zend/Controller/Request/Abstract.php, function setActionName($value) line 155:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if (null === $value) { $this->setParam($this->getActionKey(), $value); }

I think it should be:
---------------------

if (null !== $value) { $this->setParam($this->getActionKey(), $value); }

or better be removed completly to get the behaviour of Zend 1.6.2:

 
    1. Detect an invalid controller -->  rewrite to default controller
    2. Call the desired action. If  the action method does not exist --> invoke __call() for error handling.


another solution is, to change the getDefaultControllerClass(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract $request) in Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php on line 426/427 from: $request->setControllerName($controller) ->setActionName(null); to: $request->setControllerName($controller);

Because I think it is not necessary to reset the actionName after falling back to the default controller.

Maybe I could be wrong but using it with the following code snipped in ZF 1.6.2 works as expected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $controller->setControllerDirectory('/path-to/controller/directory'); $controller->setParams(array('useDefaultControllerAlways' =>true)); $controller->throwExceptions(true); $controller->returnResponse(true); $controller->setBaseUrl("/custom/base-url/here'); $controller->getRouter()->addRoute('default', new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex('(?:([a-z-]+))(?:/([a-z-]+))?(?:/([a-z0-9-]+)/)?', array ( 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index' ), array( 1=>'controller', 2=>'action', 3=>'value' ) )); $output = $controller->dispatch();

return $output;
---------------

Any suggestions?

First off, the controller is only ever rewritten to IndexController if you have set the 'useDefaultControllerAlways' front controller parameter; otherwise, if the controller is not found, an exception indicating this is thrown, at which point you can determine the original action called by inspecting the request object stored in the error\_handler parameter.

BTW, this behavior is by design; if the controller cannot be found, in all liklihood the action does not exist in the IndexController and would throw an exception -- so when using useDefaultControllerAlways, the action is rewritten to the index action to ensure a dispatchable action.

One way to capture the _matched_ action is to capture it in a plugin that operates in either routeShutdown(), dispatchLoopStartup(), or preDispatch(); simply capture the value of the request object's action parameter.
