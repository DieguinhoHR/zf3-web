### Description

Would be great to have an ability to set a default format for Zend\_Date objects, instead of doing this thing every time:

<?php echo Zend\_Date::now()->get(Zend\_Date::DATE\_MEDIUM);

I would do this instead:

<?php Zend\_Date::setDefaultFormat(Zend\_Date::DATE\_MEDIUM); echo Zend\_Date::now();

What do you think?
