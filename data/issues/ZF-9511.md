### Description

The Module provider works by more or less cloning a target resource, which by default is the application directory. To create the resource that will be added to the project profile it iterates through the application directory, adding resources to the about to be created module resource. When it descends deeper into the tree (it uses RecursiveIteratorIterator) it adds the current parent onto a parent stack to keep track. When it ascends back up the tree, it is supposed to pop as many parents off of the parent stack, as leaves it is ascending, so that resources have the correct parent (i.e. if it is ascending two levels, two parents should pop off the stack).

The popping code is on lines 105-112 of Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Module.php. If the depth difference is less than 0, then a do-while loop is entered that (I think) is intended to pop off parents until the depth difference is back to 0. The problem is the while conditional is "while($i-- > 0)", but the elseif conditional that gets you into the do-while loop specifies that $depthDifference < 0, which implies that $i < 0 to begin with. $i starting at less than 0, $i-- will never be greater than 0, and the while condition will never be satisfied.

 
            } elseif ($depthDifference < 0) {
                // if we went up to a parent, make note
                $i = $depthDifference;
                do {
                    // if we went out more than 1 parent, get to the correct parent
                    $currentResource = array_pop($parentResources);
                } while ($i-- > 0);
            }


Since this is a do-while loop, the first iteration happens no matter what, and the problem doesn't manifest itself unless the depth difference is more than 1 (i.e. if $depthDifference < 1). This is how I got the views directory inside the models directory.

This could be fixed by changing the loop to

 
                for($i = $depthDifference; $i < 0; $i++) {
                    $currentResource = array_pop($parentResources);             
                }
