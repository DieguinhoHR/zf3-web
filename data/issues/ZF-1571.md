ZF-1571: Wrong method call in zend.controller.plugins.html examples

### Description

The example code on page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.plugins.html) seems to be incorrect. In various examples the following method is called:

Zend\_Controller\_Error::\_getRequest()

This method does not exist, AFAIK. Discussion on #zftalk indicates that it should be either Zend\_Controller\_Error::\_getParam() or $this->getRequest()->getParam()

This occurs in the following sections: 7.10.5.1.1 and 7.10.5.1.3.

Also, while working on this document, it would help to indicate how one can retrieve the actual exception from the error object... this doesn't become obvious from the documentation.
