ZF-1085: Incorrect column selection syntax for multiple colums
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The SELECT statement is not incorrectly prepared when selecting multiple columns. The problem specifically is when quoting the column names - Currently all the columns selected are quoted togather, and they should be quoted seperately.

For example, if I select "columns id,name,password" from table "user", the framework creates the following statement:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT `user`.`id,name,password` FROM `user` 


which returns MySQL error 1054.

The columns should be quoted seperately - using the previous example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT `user`.`id`,`user`.`name`,`user`.`password` FROM `user`


If there's only one table to choose from, the framework should recognize this and avoid using the table name before each column to create a shorter statement, i.e:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT `id`,`name`,`username` FROM `user`


P.S This bug was present in the previous release as well (0.8.0) but release 0.7.0 worked fine. I also believe this issue relates only to MySQL 5.0 and above

This is as designed.

You must use an array of columns, not a comma-separated list of columns in a string.
