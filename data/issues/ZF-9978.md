### Description

method: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::fetchAssoc()

The current code uses array\_slice and array\_values to get the value of the first column:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    while ($row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        $tmp = array_values(array_slice($row, 0, 1));
        $data[$tmp[0]] = $row;
    }


My first thought was that a clean and simple reset would be better, but to my surprise this was actually a bit slower:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // NOT faster (but it looks cleaner though)
    while ($row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        $tmp = reset($row);
        $data[$tmp] = $row;
    }


However, using key lookup, it became more than 3 times as fast, but you need additional code, executed once, to get the key name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);
    if ($row) {
        $colName = key($row);
        do {
            $data[$row[$colName]] = $row;
        } while ($row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC));
    }


Note: local timing gave timings of about 3.2 versus 0.9 seconds for going through a 14000 record array a 100 times (thus excluding the fetch from the loop).

Note: according to the PHP manual an array that has just been assigned to another variable is reset, thus a reset before the call to key() is not needed.

Note: If you start indexing by column name as per this code, it would be fairly easy to add the column name to use as keys as a parameter to this method. This is even better when using "select \* ..." and you thus cannot be sure of the order of the columns. This kind of changes the issue type to new feature as well.

Code including changed doc:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Fetches all SQL result rows as an associative array.
         *
         * The given column (or first column if absent) is used as key.
         * the entire row array is the value.
         * You should construct the query to be sure that
         * the key column contains unique values, or else
         * rows with duplicate values in this column will
         * overwrite previous data.
         *
         * @param string|Zend_Db_Select $sql An SQL SELECT statement.
         * @param mixed $bind Data to bind into SELECT placeholders.
         * @param string|null $col Column name to use as key. If null, the first column is used as key
         * @return array
         */
        public function fetchAssoc($sql, $bind = array(), $col = null)
        {
            $stmt = $this->query($sql, $bind);
            $data = array();
            $row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);
            if ($row) {
                if ($col === null) {
                    $col = key($row);
                }
                do {
                    $data[$row[$col]] = $row;
                } while ($row = $stmt->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC));
            }
            return $data;
        }
