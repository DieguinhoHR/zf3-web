### Description

In Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getRequestUri()
        {
            if (empty($this->_requestUri)) {
                $this->setRequestUri();
            }
    
            return $this->_requestUri;
        }


if the BASE\_URL is encoded the name of the module, controller is not correct Let's say that we have the following URL

/~user/module/controller/action

which is encoded to

/%7Euser/module/controller/action

the module name is not ok

maybe

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     return $this->_requestUri;


should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return urldecode($this->_requestUri);

Sorry, this was sitting as In Progress instead of "Resolved".

Re-opening, since the patch hasn't actually been applied yet.

This change breaks backward compatibility.

Test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testPathInfoShouldNotDecodeRequestParams()
    {
        $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
        $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = '/module/controller/action/param/escaped%2Fstring';
        $pathInfo = $request->getPathInfo();
    
        $this->assertEquals( '/module/controller/action/param/escaped%2Fstring', $pathInfo, $pathInfo);
    }

Recent change to 1.11.1 brakes applications that send / as encoded parameter to action. Attaching patch with tests.

Recent patch fixes issue ZF-11017 as well

Once this issue is resolved, please run the unit tests for ZF-10964 (there is a group by the same name) or all of the Zend\_Rest tests. I've made some changes there that may need to be reverted depending on the fix here.

According to the comments, the patch appears to work, which I can confirm. Any reason why there has been no progress since?

Potential fix in trunk at r24002 - asking for watchers to test now.
