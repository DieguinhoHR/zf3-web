ZF-3861: set default encoding for Zend\_Pdf\_Page::drawText
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

typing same encoding in every method-call is annoying. There should be setDefaultEncoding method for Zend\_Pdf\_Page and Zend\_Pdf If i set default encoding for Zend\_Pdf -> all new pages should also have this encoding by default

The default encoding is defined by current locale.

Do you see it's useful to have an option to set it to something different?

Yeah. That may be good to have something like setDefaultEncoding($encodeng) where null means 'encoding defined by current locale' and any other value is converted to string and used as encoding.

I disagree.

Encoding and locale are 2 separated things. Locale i.e. is czech, russian or german. But encoding is i.e. UTF-8. If you look at declaration of drawString() - you will see it calls Zend\_Pdf\_Resource\_Font::encodeString() which is wrapper for iconv() That means encoding is the first param for iconv() function. So there is no way to convert locale to encoding

Anyway alternatively you can use native iconv\_set\_encoding() to set default encoding. Unluckily there is no reference in documentation about such behaviour.

Current locale may contain encoding information, ex:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    setlocale(LC_ALL, 'cs_CZ.ISO-8859-2');
    setlocale(LC_ALL, 'cs_CZ.UTF-8');
    setlocale(LC_ALL, 'de_DE.ISO-8859-1);


iconv() uses it if empty string is provided as 'to' or 'from' encoding.

On the other hand I definitely agree, it should be described in the documentation more clear, probably in addition to the adding setDefaultEncoding() method.

OK i see. I thought u mean Zend\_Locale. I agree the documentation should be more clear. That is the main reason for creating this issue
