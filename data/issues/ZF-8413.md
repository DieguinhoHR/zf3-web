Detaching Zend\_Filter from the affected components. Zend\_Filter is not the reason why filters are applied twice.

Since both the view Zend\_App resource plugin as well as the layout resource plugin only pass the options on to resp. Zend\_View and Zend\_Layout, this is not a bug in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Layout. Therefore I'm -deassigning (why does my spellchecker not recognize that word?)- revoking the zend\_application\_resouce component and myself as assignee.

For those looking for a fix, here's a quick patch. Tested briefly in ZF 1.11.10 I'm pretty new to ZF, so there should be a better way.
