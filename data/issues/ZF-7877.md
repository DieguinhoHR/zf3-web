### Description

A class Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ApplicationTestCase should be added that allows to test your MVC application with a given Zend\_Application instance.

There is lots of buzz and questions on the mailing lists on how to get Zend App running with Zend Test and it seems not to be an easy task, so we should offer the convenience there.

Benjamin please see my other issue here: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7839>

The goal is the same I believe.

The ControllerTestCase now allows you to specify a Zend\_Application instance to the $bootstrap property.
