Many are fixed (see Fisheye link), but some remain:

Zend\_Date::setLocale($locale = null) needs to be refactored and added to Zend\_Locale, so that Zend\_Measure\* and others can share this same code.

For example, a new

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::setLocale($locale = null)
    {
        $this->_Locale = Zend_Locale::set($locale);
        return $this->getLocale();
    }


Similarly, the constructor for Zend\_Measure could then contain the code below (and the corresponding unit tests would then pass):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $this->_Locale = Zend_Locale::set($locale);

No fisheye found !

No SVN change found!

Changing setLocale to be static brakes existing Zend\_Locale in not being able to change the own locale anymore.

Having classes create a locale object just for setting a new locale identifier does also brake existing code, as several classes (Zend\_Translate, Zend\_Currency,...) only use the locale identifier which is checked with the static function Zend\_Locale::isLocale(); So there is no need for this classes to initiate a new locale object just for having the string identifier.

Btw: Having a locale identifier set which is not avaiable should throw an exeption in the calling class. This was the reason for inclusion of isLocale();

AND: The reason for the unit tests to fail IS BECAUSE THE LOCALE IS UNKNOWN... This is expected behavior... the unit tests are just wrong because the measure classes do not check if the locale is right... this has changed in past... not the checking is done by Zend\_Locale and not anymore within the calling class

a simple

if (!Zend\_Locale::isLocale($locale) { throw new Zend\_Measure\_Exception("unknown locale ($locale) given", $locale); }

within all functions which set Locales in a class will solve the problem

To clearify for locale:

Only identifier needed (MOST CLASSES USE THIS): if (!$locale = Zend\_Locale::isLocale($locale)) { throw new EXCEPTION }

Object needed (for now only Zend\_Date is in need of this) if ($locale instanceof Zend\_Locale) { $this->\_Locale = $locale; }

 
        if (!$locale = Zend_Locale::isLocale($locale)) {
            throw new Zend_Date_Exception("Given locale ($locale) does not exist", $locale);
        } else {
            $this->_Locale = new Zend_Locale($locale);
        }


Only identifier needed (MOST CLASSES USE THIS): but additionaly create if $locale is NULL: if (!$locale = Zend\_Locale::isLocale($locale, true)) { throw new EXCEPTION }

Same for object creation...

See Zend\_Date->isLocale() for locale object example

See Zend\_Translate->setAdapter() for locale identifier example

I would have reworked this as I have time, but as you assigned this to you I dont want to brake already made changes by you because you seem to have forgotten to commit your changes ;-)

Fixed for Zend\_Measure and all it's subclasses...

0 errors on my side, expected 3 on your timezone.

First, there is a Fisheye link on _every_ issue page. See the links immediately above the first comment: {quote} Commit 2834 by gavin [Jan 16, 2007 6:09:57 PM] Fix for "losing" locale on creation (ZF-764) + consistency improvement for constant defintions. trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Date.php 2834 (+65 -66) diff {quote}

Secondly, I did not propose a fundamental change in behavior, but only a refactoring to eliminate redundant code that would be duplicated across classes.

The notation "Zend\_Date::" above did not mean the method should be static, this is just one way of indentifying which class the method belongs in. The keywork "static" should precede a method name, if the intent were to make it static.

I reviewed all the recent commits, and they appear to be exactly what I expected. Thanks! :)
