### Description

Error first occurred with ZF v1.9.4. Upgraded to 1.10.4 and error still persists when attempting to construct a URL to get data from an outside source. As has been observed in other tickets there is no class in this file so I disregard that part of the error. The autoloader functions fine on other classes in the lib. Have added the directory in which this file resides to the include\_path of my PHP in order to try and circumvent an autoloader location problem but error persists.

Env: Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3 and built-in Apache, ZF 1.10.4, PHP 5.3.2 (ZE 2.3.0)

Could you attach code to reproduce this error?

When you are upgrading then you must upgrade the complete framework.

The given line 331 from your exception trace is an array\_shift() command. Zend\_Loader itself is never called within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname.

Closing as not reproduceable.

Zend\_Loader is never called within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname. The files are manually included as they are no classes but only resources.

Feel free to reopen when you have new informations for reproduction.

Tested against ZF 1.10.4

Firstly, Zend Loader was just my guess nothing definitive - I look to you for more detail on what the cause for this can be.

Obviously I upgraded the whole framework, even installed into different path and changed my php.ini to point to it- nothing in my post would suggest otherwise.

Despite the content of the error message, ZF IS finding the file as evidenced by the fact that when the Com.php file is renamed to XXXCom.php the error is not evident, presumably because the code checks for file existence before taking whatever step throws the error. I would suggest that section of the code that executes when the file is found should be the first point of investigation.

This error (or similar) has been bouncing around in several previous versions and while it may not be common, it is also clear that so many disparate people could not have come across this without there being some circumstance under which this occurs, even if it is not common across every setup. It needs to be addressed and not closed as non-reproducable out of hand. For me, in this instance, it is impacting a production website and while renaming the file seems to have little ill effect for now, it is obviously a blatant hack that should not be necessary.

My code is not complex and the relevant snippet is below - I cannot provide the precise URL or key as it is an internal web service but I believe that should not make any difference to the error.

I am more than willing to perform diagnostics or patch the code on the system to collect more information for you as I believe this bug needs squashing once and for all or if there is a simple configuration problem that occurs with an apparent standard install or a certain PHP version on a particular platform that otherwise works perfectly then it needs to be added to the install document.

- - - - - -

$uri = Zend\_Registry::get('configuration')->reviews->url->development."getReviews/?"; foreach($trimIds as $id){ $uri .= 'submodelId='.$id['chrome\_id'].'&'; }

 
        $uri .= "expandSubmodels=true&firstResult={$skip}&max={$count}";
        $client = new Zend_Http_Client($uri);
        $pubcode = Zend_Registry::get('site')->reviews->code;
        $client->setHeaders('publisher-code', $pubcode);
    
        try {
            $response = $client->request('GET');
        } catch (Exception $e) {

Additonally:

I have no custom error handling. This is about as standard as a setup can get - ZF was installed from MacPorts if there have been any reported problems with that version.

Tested same codebase on a clean install of Zend Server CE on Windows XP.

File used for install downloaded on 5/21 - ZendServer-CE-php-5.3.2-5.0.1-Windows\_x86.exe.

Error occurs in identical manner.

Take a look at what you posted:

{quote} Trace:

=================================================================================================================================

{quote}

According to this exception which you added to this issue, Zend\_Validate\_Hostname throws an exception on line 331 at the comment Zend\_Loader::loadClass.

Line 331 from Zend/Validate/Hostname.php is an array\_shift command. Additionally Zend\_Loader is never called from within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname... Zend\_Loader itself is not even used within the complete class.

So there must be a old file or framework within the paths you are using.

When you say that you updated your framework from 1.9.4 to 1.10.3 and the exception is still the same then something must be completely wrong on your side because the line numbers have changed between these two releases.

Please note the Zend Framework is not Zend Server CE, so I can not say what release they integrated. Fact for me is that Zend\_Loader is not used within Zend\_Validate\_Hostname in all 1.10 releases so the conclusion for me is that you are not using a 1.10 release.

Take a look into Zend/Validate/Hostname and look at the revision number on top of that file. It should note 21063. When it's below then you are not using 1.10.x
