ZF-6014: Dojo (Digit) form elements get unqualified (widget) IDs, causing conflicting widgetid
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Dojo Digit form element widgets get an unqualified name, id, and widgetid, after the form name has been set. The digit widgetid name space appears to be global, so conflicts can easily happen if more than one form has been created. Should the widgetid set by form->setName been used in generating the fully qualified id?

class Project\_Model\_Form\_Deliverable extends Zend\_Dojo\_From

 
    public function init()
    {
        $this->setName('deliverableform')


// ... $this->addElement('SubmitButton', 'save', array( 'required' => false, 'ignore' => true, 'label' => 'Save', ));

generated html <span class="dijit dijitReset dijitLeft dijitInline dijitButton" ... " widgetid="save"> ..

Use setElementsBelongTo() to set the namespace to which form elements belong. Beyond that, there's nothing more we can do here -- the potential for conflicting IDs is possible regardless of whether or not ZF generates the widgets.
