### Description

Although the coding standards is clear to use space only for indentation, lot of files contains tabs. I will correct this with some automation and commit this component by component.

For the record, I am using (in bash):

for file in `grep -lP "\t" $(find -name "*.php")`; do expand -i -t4 $file > $file.new ; mv $file.new $file ; done
