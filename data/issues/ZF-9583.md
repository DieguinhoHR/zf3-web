### Description

I've been encoutering some problems with the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File while uploading. The error message

File 'file' exceeds the defined ini size

Keeps showing up at irregular moments. I cache my forms, so it doesn't have to be initialized every time. It seems that this doesn't work well with the File element.

I've put a demo over here: [http://gwsystems.nl/element\_file\_bug.php](http://gwsystems.nl/element_file_bug.php)

The php.ini say I've a limit of 100M and I can upload files to my server. It really is a Zend\_Framework problem, not a server problem.

The source is viewable at: [http://gwsystems.nl/element\_file\_bug.php/â€¦](http://gwsystems.nl/element_file_bug.php?source=true)

However, I've never seen this error on my local system (windows).

The error is added at the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::isValid (118).

- One of your validators is used wrong
- Loading the form from cache something is wrong. The returned failure is from PHP. In detail $\_FILES[xxx]['error'] is set to 1 instead of 0. ZF just returns a usefull description instead of an integer value.

Look what $\_FILES does... this could help you to debug your code.

I've removed the validators. The error still occurs.

Have you seen my demo? I've added the \_FILES data, it seems ok. The errorcode is 4, which is valid, because I don't upload anything.

Try uploading no file, this shouldn't give an error, unless required is set to true.

Tried your demo several (~40) times empty and ~10 times with Fileupload, there was no error for me, does this mean you found a solution for your problem, and this issue could be closed?

You're right, the problem doesn't occur anymore. When I add the Size validator, it does. Can you verify this?

what happens if you do not clone $form, but save it directly to cache?

Answer to myself the same error, but the displayed message "File 'file' exceeds the defined ini size" is defined in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Upload and not in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size.

And it is displayed because the Transfer Adapter sets the error to int(1) in

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function isValid($files = null)
        {
            // Workaround for WebServer not conforming HTTP and omitting CONTENT_LENGTH
            $content = 0;
            if (isset($_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH'])) {
                $content = $_SERVER['CONTENT_LENGTH'];
            } else if (!empty($_POST)) {
                $content = serialize($_POST);
            }
    
            // Workaround for a PHP error returning empty $_FILES when form data exceeds php settings
            if (empty($this->_files) && ($content > 0)) {
                if (is_array($files)) {
                    $files = current($files);
                }
    
                $temp = array($files => array(
                    'name'  => $files,
                    'error' => 1));
                $validator = $this->_validators['Zend_Validate_File_Upload'];
                $validator->setFiles($temp)
                          ->isValid($files, null);
                $this->_messages += $validator->getMessages();
                return false;
            }
    
            return parent::isValid($files);
        }

Added appropriate Components

I think now this ones real issue is Zend\_Form\_Element\_File not setting up $adapter->\_files when loading the Form from cache and that makes Adapters isValid method add the error 1 to the filename.

When not loading from cache $adapter->\_files is filled with array('file' => ...)

I never said that it's within the Size validator. I knew that it's the Upload validator. That's the reason why I asked you for the content of $\_FILES.

Looking at your online example there ARE differences.

Why is $\_FILES different when you send it and when you load it from cache?

The code block you referred to prevents a PHP problem. The only way how it can run into this block is when $\_FILES is empty and $\_SERVER['CONTENT\_LENGTH'] is not empty. PHP itself has a problem when one of it's settings is lower than the provided POST content.

I don't think that it's a problem of the component because the component reacts only on the input from $\_POST, $\_FILES and some $\_SERVER settings. When the cached data differs then also the output differs.

Note that when you are caching the input, it's also possible that you get an "attacker" exception.

Note that the file element is not set to be optional. So raising an failure when no file is given is correct behaviour.

Thanks for the journey into Zend\_File ;P This can not work as you expect because Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http \_prepareFiles() within and only within \_\_construct() from Global $\_FILES.

So you will always end up serializing the Adapter with $\_FILES at time of saving to cache.

Which is either empty and generates this messages in conclusion, or is filled with the at-save-time uploaded $\_FILES metadata, and thus generates an Attack Error because the actual file data for the saved $\_FILES is missing.

Workaround, add to your Form class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __wakeup()
    {
       $this->init();
    }


or call it after loading $form from cache with $form->init();

Thomas, what do you think, could this be closed now? Or should we make a Feature Request for the ability to store Forms with File Elements in cache?

Closing as non-issue.

$\_FILES content is different before saving and after loading from cache. The file adapter is therefor not able to work.

The only solution is to create a new instance of Zend\_File\_Transfer and add it to the element AFTER it has been loaded from cache and BEFORE running validation.

Note that PHP itself does not allow to cache temporary uploaded files.

I do not want to cache input or tempfiles, I want to cache the form structure as build in the init. I load the form form cache and use it to validate \_POST or to set defaults and allow users to change it.

I know understand the issue and can create a work-around for it. Isn't it possible to add a \_wakeup method to the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File and reinit only that element?

 

 

Posted by Martin Winkel (storeman) on 2010-04-05T06:48:15.000+0000

The following solves my problem:

[code] public function \_\_wakeup(){ $this->\_adapter = null; } [/code]
