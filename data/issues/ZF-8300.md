For support please see the mailing list, IRC or zfforums, don't clog up the issue tracker with non-issues.

We need way more detail on the issue: how did you configure Dojo, where was Dojo installed in your application, etc.

Regarding JS and CSS minimization, please see the relevant page in the manual: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.dojo.build-layers.html)
