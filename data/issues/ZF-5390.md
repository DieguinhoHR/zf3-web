### Description

Matthew, your blog posts on using Models in an application are great. In fact, I think posts like that need to be compiled into an entry for the ZF reference manual under the chapter Zend\_Model (just to let people know where to find it, even though there's no concrete Zend\_Model implementation).

Please also write that neither Active Record, Table Gateway or Data Mapper are models, but Transaction Script, Table Module and Domain Model (only in conjunction with Server Layer) are.

How come that those 3 patterns are never mentioned in the model debate? although even fowler discusses them in great length as patterns of the domain logic.

Ben -- our QuickStart actually uses (and names it as such!) the Table Module pattern, and I specifically mention Transaction Script and Domain Model in my blog posts. :)

Active Record, Table Data Gateway, and Data Mapper are all data access patterns. That's definitely one thing I've been trying to get across in my blog series.
