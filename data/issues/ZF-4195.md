### Description

Hello,

Whenever a validation of Zend\_Form\_Element\_File fails, Zend\_Translate\_Adapter / PHP throws the following warning:

Warning: Illegal offset type in isset or empty in Zend\\Translate\\Adapter.php on line 497

This is my example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $form = new Zend_Form(array(
                'action'   => '/upload',
                'method'   => 'post',
                'enctype'  => 'multipart/form-data',
                'name'     => 'uploadForm',
                'elements' => array(
                    'submit' => array('submit', array(
                        'label' => 'Go',
                        'order' => 10,
                    )),
                )
            ));
            
            // Prepage file element
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
            $element->setLabel('Upload file')
                    ->setRequired(true)
                    ->setDestination($this->getCurrentDirectory())
                    ->addValidator('Count', false, 1)
                    ->addValidator('NotExists', $this->getCurrentDirectory())
                    ->addValidator('Size', false, array($size));
    
            $form->addElement($element, 'file');


As you can see, I was not able to add the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File to the array because I just didn't get the validators properly to work. This might be an issue as well. I used the trunk version from today.

Not an issue. You set false properties.

See here:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ->addValidator('Size', false, array($size));


But allowed is only number, number or array(number, number)

And you set number, array(number)

See the failure ?

Simply fix your code to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ->addValidator('Size', false, $size);

Hello Thomas,

thank you for the hint. Though, I somewhere read that only the maximum size is required in the array. And the validator seems to work correctly.

Well, I tried your suggestion but unfortunately there wasn't the tinniest improvement to see. The warning still occurs right beneath the error message "The file 'Whatever.rar' is bigger than allowed".

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-09-05T07:23:52.000+0000

Why should there be no improvement ?

Before you got:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Now you got:


I see this as improvment.

What about reading the error message? Could it be that the file you want to transfer is bigger than you allowed it ? :-)

Btw: What should "false" be for a size or count value ? As parameter is only integer or string allowed.... just read the manual for the proper usage.

Nope, I never said the validation wouldn't work. I got the right validation message already before I opened this issue (I only didn't get it to work when I pass it as an array, therefore I did it almost exactly as in the manual). This issue is about the warning only. All I'm saying is, that whenever a file is transfered that isn't completely valid, the expected error message occures and with it a warning.

> > What should "false" be for a size or count value ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Form_Element 
    {
              public function addValidator($validator, $breakChainOnFailure = false, $options = array()) 
              { }
    }

So you are using the form element... but why have you set this here ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    What should getCurrentDirectory do here when a boolean is expected in the form helper ?


Shouldn't it be ``` regarding to your example and the method header you gave ?

I would expect that giving an empty array as parameter if a file exists throws an warning about illegal offset...

This might be true. So I removed all validators but the size validator (otherwise I wouldn't get an error at all).

Warning remains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
            $element->setLabel('Upload file')
                    ->setRequired(true)
                    ->setDestination($this->getCurrentDirectory())
                    ->addValidator('Size', false, 2097152); // 2MB


Warning remains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...->addValidator('Size', 2097152);


Warning remains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...->addValidator('Size', false, array('0kB', '2097152kB', 'fileupload'));


No warning because there is no validation at all ?!?:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...->setRequired(false)


May be it IS an issue? ;-)

So let's clearify some things:

setRequired can not be false. This is a known problem. Have you set minimum and maxium for all files ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    This one will NOT work:


because you named you element 'file' and not 'fileupload'.

And related to your warning: ``` This warning is thrown by Zend\_Translate and not Zend\_File\_Transfer. It seems as you tried to translate a array into another language.

> > setRequired can not be false. This is a known problem. Yes, I read that already

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...->addValidator('Size', false, array('0kB', '2097152kB', 'fileupload'));


works, because I changed it to make sure it has nothing to do with the name (should have mentioned)

> > This warning is thrown by Zend\_Translate and not Zend\_File\_Transfer. Well, this might be true. But as I have not defined a string to translate, Zend\_File\_Transfer does it for me (or tries). So I think, may be I'm wrong, that it is a Zend\_File\_Transfer problem, because it does not pass the strings/arrays correctly to Zend\_Translate.

Ah, forgot to mention, that I only upload one file at a time with only one Zend\_Form\_Element\_File.

So I think, may be I'm wrong, that it is a Zend\_File\_Transfer problem, because it does not pass the strings/arrays correctly to Zend\_Translate.

Somewhere in your code you have defined a translation object. Zend\_File\_Transfer has no relation to Zend\_Translate, no line which allows to call it. Nor does Zend\_File\_Transfer define any strings to be translated.

Can it be that you defined a translation for Zend\_Form and not for Zend\_File\_Transfer ?

 

 

Posted by Tobias Schifftner (milchbazi) on 2008-09-05T15:33:13.000+0000

Yes, that's definite... But shouldn't Zend\_Translate be supported by all Zend\_Form\_Element\_\* classes? So it is an issue ;-)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-09-06T01:48:51.000+0000

Probably... Generally Zend\_Form\_Element which is the parent of all Zend\_Form\_Elements handles all translations.

But why is this then a problem of Zend\_File\_Transfer ??? This is where I don't get the clue of your issue.

And just to mention: A warning of Zend\_Translate does not stop validation. It is thrown after validation has occured.

 

 

Posted by Tobias Schifftner (milchbazi) on 2008-09-06T03:52:58.000+0000

I see what you mean. That's true, I do not know, I only assume it has something to do with Zend\_File. Otherwise all other forms would throw a warning as well... May be I can figure out tonight what really happends right before the warning.
