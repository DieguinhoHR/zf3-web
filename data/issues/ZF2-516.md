### Description

The FormRow-Helper seems not to use a translator service present for the label portion:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $this->add(array(
                'name' => 'username',
                'attributes' => array(
                    'type'  => 'text',
                ),
                'options' => array(
                    'label' => 'username',
                )
            ));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function onBootstrap($e)
    {
        \Locale::setDefault('de_DE');
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->formRow($this->form->get('username')); 
    echo $this->formLabel($this->form->get('username'));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Output incorrect: "username", even if translation available
    Output correct: "Benutzername" (DE translation of "username")

The FormLabel's translation functionality is covered with a unit test (and currently passing): [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/tests/ZendTest/Form/View/Helper/FormLabelTest.php#L145-L160)

For the translator to automatically attach to the view helpers, the translator should be in the service locator. Example via config from the skeleton application: [https://github.com/zendframework/…](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/blob/master/module/Application/config/module.config.php#L60-L69)

Here is the code that pulls it out of the service locator and attaches it to the view helpers (including FormLabel): [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/View/HelperPluginManager.php#L136-L144)

Some things to check: \* Confirm that the translator is set on the FormLabel helper: var\_dump($this->formLabel()->getTranslator()) \* Do the translation text domains match?: var\_dump($this->formLabel()->getTranslatorTextDomain()) \* Does the translation key match and exist in your DE translation file?

EDIT: Apologies, I just noticed your output of both FormRow and FormLabel together... I will set up a test here and take a look see. Thanks!

FormRow was not translating the label. Fixed in this PR: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2300>
