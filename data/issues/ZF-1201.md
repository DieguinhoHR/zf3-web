There's been a fair amount of discussion of this topic on the fw-mvc list, and I'm not sure it's appropriate to make this change. The idea of \_redirect() is for general redirection, and not necessarily redirection within the site itself.

Probably a better idea is to create an additional method, createUrl(), that could be used by \_forward() and also used to generate a URL to pass to \_redirect(); an option in the $options array passed to \_redirect() could be used to indicate that the URL should be generated via createUrl().

I will consider the issue, but cannot guarantee it will be ready prior to the 1.0.0 release.

Added a URL action helper in r4422 -- this is in the incubator only at this point. Usage would be $this->\_helper->url($action, $controller, $module, $params), just like with \_forward(). You will need to use the version of Zend\_Controller\_Action from the incubator to test this.

Resolved for the 0.9.3 release, by use of the redirector action helper. Usage would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->redirector->goto($action, $controller, $module, $params);


or more simply:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->redirector($action, $controller, $module, $params):
