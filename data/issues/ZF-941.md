### Description

In zend.controller.providedsubclasses.html#zend.controller.providedsubclasses.rewriterouter

7.4.3.9. Using Zend\_Config with the RewriteRouter

$config = new Zend\_Config\_Ini($file);

The above line is invalid as Zend\_Config->\_construct() expects two parameters. I don't know what it should be though.
