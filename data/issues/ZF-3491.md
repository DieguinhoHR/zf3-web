### Description

A Zend\_Http\_Client object can be passed a Zend\_Uri object through it's setUri method, although this is not really promoted in the documentation. Often it is useful to 'build' a Uri using a Zend\_Uri object rather than pass a string directly.

Although Zend\_Uri does provide a facility for setting a Username/Password combination (presumably for HTTP authentication), this is not detected when the Zend\_Uri object is passed in. Theoretically this would also therefore work for with strings formatted like '[http://username:password@uri.com/](http://uri.com/)' since they are automatically converted to Zend\_Uri objects anyway.

Fixed in r17648. Added a line in the documentation and unit tests for the new feature as well. All tests pass.
