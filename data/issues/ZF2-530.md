It looks to me like getPropertyNames needs to get renamed to getProperties to follow the same naming as getConstants. Am I right?

I submitted a pull request to deprecate getPropertyNames and changed the test cases to use getProperties. (<https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2339>)

Let me know if that's all wrong.

No. getProperties() & getProperty() should follow getMethods() & getMethod(). getProperty() should return Zend\\Code\\Scanner\\PropertyScanner object.(currently not implmeted). getPropertNames() does not return propery's accessor, default value, belonged class name.

Ohh yeah....duh. Okay, I'll work on getting PropertyScanner implemented.

Thanks!
