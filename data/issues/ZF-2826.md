ZF-2826: Misleading exception message when file does not exist
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-07T09:53:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T17:25:45.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.1 (25/Mar/08)

### Description

When trying to load class and file doesn't exist, Zend\_Loader claims that file was loaded but class was not found in it.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Not_Existing_Class');


Throws an exception: Zend\_Exception: File "Not\\Existing\\Class.php" was loaded but class "Not\_Existing\_Class" was not found in the file in ...\\lib\\Zend\\Loader.php on line 87

Expected messages should be "File not found" when file doesn't exist and "File was loaded but class not found" when file exists but class not. Or current message should be changed to "File $file does not exist or class $class not found in it."

I'm assuming this fix is merged to the 1.5 release branch for release with 1.5.1. Please update JIRA if this is not the case.
