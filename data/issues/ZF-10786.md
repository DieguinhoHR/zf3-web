ZF-10786: Slashes trimmed in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route trims slashes by default, which means that on a given website, these urls are equivalent :

/login /login/ /login// //login//

IMHO, this is quite a non desirable behavior, as : \* It can break the layout if we use relative paths in the HTML (/login & /login/ are not considered the same folder); \* Having a resource accessible via multiple urls breaks one of the basic principles for SEO.

We cannot override that by providing our own routes, because of the file Zend/Controller/Router/Route.php, on line 160 : $route = trim($route, $this->\_urlDelimiter);

I've created a thread on the official forum about this issue, but got no opinion from other users : <http://forums.zend.com/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=8750>
