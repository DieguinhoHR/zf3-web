### Description

The commited patch breaks connections to Oracle9i using the standard client. It seems that the (PORT=nnnn) _MUST_ be present otherwise, the client throws an "Invalid ADDRESS" error.

The workaround is trivial: either specify the oracle port (1521 by default)

The proposed patch is also very simple, it just adds the port number.
