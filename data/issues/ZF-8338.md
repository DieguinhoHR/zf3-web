### Description

Since for 1.10 there will be support for database connections and Zend\_Application in Zend\_Tool\_Project it, an additional action for the testing provider could be easily added that generates fixtures for the complete database or certain tables from it using the Zend\_Application Db Adapter resource to introspect the development database.
