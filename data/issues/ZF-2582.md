### Description

As I pointed out in the ZF mailing list there's a remarkable number of unit test files with duplicate (and not needed) require statements or outdated code practice.

All those files should be cleaned up and, if possibile, all common best practice collected in a single page somewhere (may be the wiki?).

For further details I recommend to have a look at the following mailing list post [http://nabble.com/Multiple-%28and-perhaps-not-needâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Multiple-%28and-perhaps-not-needed%29-require-statements-to15299693s16154.html)

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning to Matthew as it is a part of ZF2 refactoring
