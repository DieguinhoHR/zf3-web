### Description

I have try zf tool to create project layout with modules. And when I create controller use it, I must edit the controller name according to the module. Ex:

$ zf create controller user index-action-included=1 admin

The command above will produce a controller in admin module with class name UserController. When access the controller, it will return error, because the controller name is not match with controller name that ZF suggest for modular project. The suggest controller name from ZF is Module\_ControllerName (Admin\_UserController).

And for this, I have made a patch for this case.
