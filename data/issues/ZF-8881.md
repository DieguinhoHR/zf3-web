### Description

Since the getMagicFile() method was modified to check if some magicfile exists in most current places like "/usr/share/...", I get warnings due to open basedir restriction on my hosting provider. It's due to the file\_exists() method, I guess...

Is it possible to deactivate that or anything ?

Typical error I get : **Warning**: file\_exists() [<function.file-exists>]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/misc/magic) is not within the allowed path(s): (/home/www/4c4a9afbc958438a3a92ddffa0303afc:/tmp:/opt/php/lib/php) in **/home/www/4c4a9afbc958438a3a92ddffa0303afc/data/lib/zend\_framework\_196/library/Zend/Validate/File/MimeType.php** on line **144**

I still got this problem with open\_basedir in effect, but safe\_mode off (that's why the check in line 154 of MimeType.php doesn't trigger):

Warning: is\_readable(): open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/misc/magic) is not within the allowed path(s): ({mypath}) in {mypath}/application/library/Zend/Validate/File/MimeType.php on line 194

PHP Version: 5.3.2-0.dotdeb.2 ZF Version: from trunk, @ r22560

Closing as won't fix.

There is no way to see which directories are allowed and which not. open\_basedir does not allow to see on which directories there are restrictions. And as soon as there is an access, the warning is thrown.

The integrated patch works in 75%. The only way to prevent this completly is to give the proper mimefile manually.

Note: open\_basedir is deprecated as of PHP 5.3
