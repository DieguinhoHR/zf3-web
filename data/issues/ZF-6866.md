### Description

Route I am using:

$category='aaaa'; new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('category/:category/:controller/:action/\*', array( 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index', 'category' => $category )

If I surf to a page with the url <http://domain/category/aaaa> And in this page there is a use of the URL() view helper:

<a href="">'aaaa') ,null,true) ?'>go category aaaa</a>

What I actually get in the HTML output is:

[go category aaaa](/category/)

When what I am expecting is:

[go category aaaa](/category/aaaa)
