ZF-9483: Zend\_Mail charset configuration
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2010-03-19T12:17:52.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:38:12.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s): - Next Major Release ()

### Description

Zend\_Mail constructor sets charset value from passed argument. This is not a problem, but there is no way to set it after you have an object of this class, there is no a setCharset(), but it still is not a problem.

The constructor has one argument, this one has as default value "iso-8859-1", it does not look good. The construct method also makes hard to extends the class and to overwrite it, once this not follow the code standard, users _must_ send default charset encoding to parent constructor.

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/PHP+Coding+Standard+%28draft%29#PHPCodingStandard%28draft%29-OptionalParameters)

_Sample_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Mail extends Zend_Mail
    {
        public function __construct()
        {
            // do something...
        }
    }
    
    $mail = new My_Mail();


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Mail extends Zend_Mail
    {
        public function __construct($charset = null)
        {
            // do something...
            parent::__construct($charset);
        }
    }
    
    $mail = new My_Mail();


_Expected result_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail->_charset; // "iso-8859-1"


_Actual result_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail->_charset; // null

Reopening because tests have not been applied yet. Also; this will not be released in a mini release because this in specific circumstances may be a BC break

Why Renan has applied only modifications about constructor without add the _setCharset_ method?

Benoit, Freeaqingme has assign this issue to himself to fix something. Actually the issue is about constructor problem, anyway i think we should add setCharset() to Zend\_Mail class.

There are some issues that could be affected, see ZF-4955 ZF-9990

+1 for adding setCharset()

Issue will be implemented with ZF2. Kinda impossible with current architecture.
