### Description

I suggest a new method in Zend\_Cache\_Core to get the Zend\_Date object which is when the cache record expires

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory([...]);
    
    $cache_id = 'myCacheRecord;
    $expires_date = $cache->whenExpires( $cache_id );

what about the test() method :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
         * Test if a cache is available or not (for the given id)
         * 
         * @param string $id cache id
         * @return mixed false (a cache is not available) or "last modified" timestamp (int) of the available cache record
         */

I think it will be better if test() returns only a boolean (cache available or not ?).

But independently it will be nice to can get informations about a cache record : for example, an array containing the "last modified" timestamp and the lifetime (or two independent methods) And why don't use Zend\_Date ?

An idea : maybe create a class Zend\_Cache\_Record with adapted methods ?
