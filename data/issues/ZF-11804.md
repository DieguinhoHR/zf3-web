Line 906 does not contain "list()". This must be the content of a parameter ($value?) which has been given by you. As the given value can not be found within the locale data an exception is thrown. This is expected behaviour.

Yes, But, in this case, why Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList() can take 3 optional parameters ?

As you can see within the reference documentation getTranslationList can take 3 parameters. {quote} Details for getTranslation($value = null, $type = null, $locale = null) {quote}

Also within the same chapter you can see that $value can be an array with optional parameters: {quote} Month

Returns a translation for a month. You have to give the number of the month as integer value. It has to be between 1 and 12. If you want to receive data for other calendars, contexts or formats, then you must give an array instead of an integer with the expected values. The array has to look like this: array( 'calendar', 'context', 'format', 'month number'). If you give only an integer then the default values are the 'gregorian' calendar, the context 'format' and the format 'wide'. Use Zend\_Date for simplicity {quote}

I would ask you simply to look into the documentation for details on how this method can be used
