ZF-6549: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_Stream incorrectly parses object names
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Location: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_Stream-> \_getNamePart()

Problem: Adds an addition / between the host and path when forming the S3 object name.

Example: <a>s3://bucket-name/object-name</a> returns a name of bucket-name//object-name

Impact: Other calls such as getInfo() fail as the object is not found.

Cause: parse\_url includes / in the 'path', there for a second "/" separator between the $url['host'] and $url['path'] is not required

Suggested fix Current line: return $url['path'] ? $url['host'].'/'.$url['path'] : $url['host']; Proposed line: return $url['path'] ? $url['host'].$url['path'] : $url['host'];

Hope this helps Glenn
