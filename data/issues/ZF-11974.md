### Description

Hi,

trying this call (using gettext adapter)

bq. $translate->plural('Software','Software',2);

never give me the plural or singular translation of the term but only Software.

Is it a limitation of Zend\_Translate or a bug ? Without it, complete translations are quite difficult.

Calling bq. $translate->plural('Software','Softwares',2); is not correct because Software have no plural forms.

Regards

PS :

po file content : {quote} msgid "Software" msgid\_plural "Software" msgstr[0] "Logiciel" msgstr[1] "Logiciels" {quote}

print\_r($this->\_data); at the end of the Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext::\_loadTranslationData function {quote} Array ( [fr\_FR] => Array ( [Software] => ) ) {quote}

Commenting this part of Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext::\_loadTranslationData function

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
                        foreach ($original as $orig) {
                             $this->_data[$locale][$orig] = '';
                        }


makes it works... But I do not know why.

How do you call Zend\_Translate? Because it does only read MO files... it does not handle or read PO files.

The implementation has tests on real plural mo-files. So my expectation is that you missed to set the proper plural rules within poedit. Details can only be seen and said when you attach the related mo file.

Zend\_Translate is called by :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
          $TRANSLATE = new Zend_Translate(array('adapter'        => 'gettext',
                                                'content'        => PATH_OF_THE_MO_FILE,
                                                'locale'         => 'fr_FR,
                                                'disableNotices' => true) 
                                         );
    
    
    $TRANSLATE->plural('Software', 'Software', 2);
    


I will attached mo and po files. These files are generated using transifex.

Po and Mo files can be found here : [https://forge.indepnet.net/projects/glpi/…](https://forge.indepnet.net/projects/glpi/repository/raw/trunk/locales/fr_FR.po)

The call looks good on the first hand. On your issue click on "more actions", there you can find "attach files".

 

 

Posted by JULIEN DOMBRE (moyo) on 2012-01-15T12:58:05.000+0000

I do not have attach files on more actions. Maybe not sufficient rights. I have put the link to the files.

Regards
