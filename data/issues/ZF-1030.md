ZF-1030: Zend\_Register::get() fails without an argument
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-03-09T08:12:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

ZF-1029 states:

Zend::registry() becomes Zend\_Registry::get()

but I've found that the argument isn't optional, as it used to be, and as described in the doc block of get().

Is this a bug, or are we now meant to use: Zend\_Register::getInstance() instead if we wish to iterate through the entire registry?

I can fix it if it is a bug, and get() should be callable without an arg, in which case should it just return the instance, or should it make a copy into a plain array?

I'm guessing it was just an oversight, I've committed a fix anyway, rev: 3839

Documentation needs to be updated. get() should not behave like getInstance(). getInstance() is the correct method to use to obtain the instance.

Ok, I've revert my previous fix and corrected the documentation.

Thanks! Just to clarify ... getInstance() is more standard than get() for retrieving the same "special" single instance every time the function is used.
