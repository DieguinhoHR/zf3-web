### Description

At this moment Zend\_Form isValid method check for each element if it is valid, passing element value and context values.

Furthermore the isValid methot of the element set element value and get it filtered (the validation came in place after filtering).

If you want to implement let's say a chain validator and you need to check the filtered value of an element against the value (filtered) of other element you need to pass the form to the validator. You cannot pass the form to the validator if the form is created form a config file.

This is why i think that the form isValid method need to populate the form with values first, at least merge context data with the filtered ones, and pass to element isValid methot filtered values for all form elements.
