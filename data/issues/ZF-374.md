The framework should include summary and detailed instructions on how to run the unit tests using PHPUnit, perhaps in a README.txt file.

Better would be to integrate a own chapter in the documentation (f.e. Appendix A - Internal Framework Testing)

I agree - good idea!

Much of the information needed to successfully run the ZF unit tests are found here: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Testing+Standards)

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-04-18T13:12:00.000+0000

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Maybe it makes sense to do this when you write the controller unit test docs? This should only require a few paragraphs, and an appendix on unit testing would be very useful.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.
