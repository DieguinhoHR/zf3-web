### Description

hello,

i wanted to upgrad zf from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3PL1. so i do that and have discovered a bug while uploading files with form. in my case i try to upload an image. i run zf with php 5.2.6 - can that be a problem cause u changed some on validation "isImage" for php 5.3.0?

so thanks in advance for your comments and help. i hope u get this fixed...
