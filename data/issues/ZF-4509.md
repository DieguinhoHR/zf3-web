According to the Docs:

Example 40.13. Retrieving Related Artists

$as = new Zend\_Service\_Audioscrobbler(); $as->setArtist('LCD Soundsystem'); // Set the artist for whom you would like to retrieve related artists $relatedArtists = $as->artistGetRelatedArtists(); // Retrieve the related artists foreach ($relatedArtists as $artist) { print '[' . $artist->name . ']('%20.%20$artist-)  
'; // Display the related artists }

Setting the artist can be done with the set($field, $value) method that is implemented in Zend\_Service\_Audioscrobbler. The actual setArtist method is not available. I've implemented a this convenience method that reuses the set($field, $value) method proved by Zend\_Service\_Audioscrobbler to comply with the information provided in the documentation.

Not only does setArtist() not exist, but also setAlbum, setUser, setTag and so on.

They were all be added by a \_\_call intercept that proxies to set($name, $field)

Merged fix into 1.7 release branch, due to possible 1.7.3 release
