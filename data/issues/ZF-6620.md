### Description

At the moment I have to do something like this to fetch objects rather than arrays from the database

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    protected function _initFetch(){
    
        $this->bootstrap('db');
        $db = $this->getResource('db');
    
        $db->setFetchMode(Zend_Db::FETCH_OBJ);
    
    }


It would be great if the existing Db resource could take another config line like this

resources.db.fetchMode = 5
