### Description

I have a standard app structure : - application -- configs -- controllers -- forms -- models -- views --- helpers ---- XXX.php (class View\_Helper\_XXX extends Zend\_View\_Helper\_Abstract) --- scripts -- library

With this autoloader : $moduleLoader = new Zend\_Application\_Module\_Autoloader(array( 'namespace' => '', 'basePath' => APPLICATION\_PATH ));

When call View\_Helper\_XXX in a view ($this->XXX()) ->

exception 'Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception' with message 'Plugin by name 'XXX' was not found in the registry; used paths: ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_: ZendX/JQuery/View/Helper/ Zend\_View\_Helper\_: Zend/View/Helper/ :/my/app/dir/application/views/helpers/

The loader load my helper file, no problem, But It search for Zend\_View\_Helper\_XXX So, If I change my class name from View\_Helper\_XXX to Zend\_View\_Helper\_XXX, it works, it isn't logic it's name prefix is "Zend\_"

PS : I have no problem to load Form\_XX, Model\_XXX

Hi,

Same issue here with the version 11.3 of the framework. If I read the doc, I should just need to create a View\_Helper\_XXX class in my views/helpers folder. Quote of the doc [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader-resource.html) :

"This loader, Zend\_Application\_Module\_Autoloader, comes with the following mappings:

forms/ => Form models/ => Model DbTable/ => Model\_DbTable mappers/ => Model\_Mapper plugins/ => Plugin services/ => Service views/ helpers => View\_Helper filters => View\_Filter"

I got everything (from, model, mappers, ...) working fine except for the helpers. So I create a really simple helper helper class name View\_Helper\_Test stored in views/helpers. And I made some echos in the Zend\_Plugin\_Loader interface. Intrestingly, here is what I have :

... Zend\_Filter\_Word\_CamelCaseToDash | Zend/Filter/Word\\CamelCaseToDash.php | isReadable | ClassExists Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower | Zend/Filter/StringToLower.php | isReadable | ClassExists Zend\_View\_Helper\_Test | C:/Users/Olivier/Documents/Eclipse/workspace/dealecta.com/application/modules/default/views\\helpers/Test.php | isReadable | Zend/View/Helper/Test.php CLASS NOT FOUND

The first echo is the class name the plugin loader is looking for. And I don't know why, but he is looking for a Zend\_View\_Helper\_Test and not View\_Helper\_Test.

So Either, it is a bug either documentation is missing something.

Let me know.
