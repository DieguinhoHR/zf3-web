### Description

Bug in snapshot 20080529-9566

while ($this->\_stmt->nextRowset()) {} before $this->\_stmt->closeCursor(); causes some queries to be returned in error with SQLSTATE[HYC00]: Optional feature not implemented

Most often this occurs when using pdo\_mysql and attempting to execute more than one query. This issue is related to ZF-2101 and a result of attempting to resolve that issue.

Affects PHP version 5\* Affects Windows Servers Does not affect Linux Servers

Is this still an issue?

This is not a Zend Framework issue, but rather a PHP 5 and MySQL library issue on Windows.

Specifically, the MySQL library for windows is known for this bug so it therefore has inherited its problem to PHP on Windows and therefore down to Zend Framework.

I do not believe there is any possible way you can change Zend Framework to fix this. Only alternative I found was to use \*nix
