### Description

Apart from providing a more code-friendly appearance, I feel that the camelcaps transform on field names creates another unnecessary layer of abstraction. If my database has user\_list\_id and member\_status, it is far more readable and understandable for those looking through the code to refer to the field names as-is. Especially as the insert/update and where criteria code still relies on the 'uncamelised' id, this treatment seems a bit inconsistent and redundant, considering the inflector that is needed to re-transform them back to the original field name.

I'm not saying to ditch this feature (as I'm sure some people do quite like this), however wish it to be a configurable option. Ideally you would enable/disable when you instantiate the Db object.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = array ('host'     => '127.0.0.1',
                     'username' => 'malory',
                     'password' => '******',
                     'dbname'   => 'camelot',
                     'transform' => Zend_Db::CASE_DEFAULT);
    
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('PDO_MYSQL', $params);


CASE\_DEFAULT = Unchanged CASE\_MIXED = Uppercase words (Camel style - strip underscores) CASE\_LOWER = Lowercase (retain underscores) CASE\_UPPER = Uppercase (retain underscores)

Almost the same as ZF-50, so let us all put our comments on these topics in ZF-50.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
