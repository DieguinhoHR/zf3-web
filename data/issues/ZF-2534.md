### Description

First, look here <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33598&edit=1> this is the php's bug.

And in the line 139:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __destruct()
        {
            if ($this->_connection instanceof Zend_Mail_Protocol_Smtp) {
                $this->_connection->quit();
                $this->_connection->disconnect();
            }
        }


We will get: Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0

The real exception is: No connection has been established to smtpserver

This issue may be outdated. I can not find the functions that are pointed out.

I'm having the same problem (Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0) with version 1.0.4.

Class: Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp Line: 139

I guess the connection is already closed and the call to:

 
            $this->_send('QUIT');


At Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp, line 364, throws an exception (same Class, line 260):

 
    protected function _send($request)
    {
        if (!is_resource($this->_socket)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception('No connection has been established to ' . $this->_host);
        }
    ...

Memo: Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract has \_send() .

I search over SVN trunk today and find same problem was fixed at SVN r6661 (2007/10/20).

The change was done for ZF-2075 . The issue was solved in Ver 1.5.0.

I suggest you update your version to the latest to solve this issue.
