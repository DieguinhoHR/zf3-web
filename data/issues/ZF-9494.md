ZF-9494: Zend\_Form::isValid() overrides translator set on an element
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-21T04:28:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-23T14:29:39.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)

### Description

Zend\_Form's isValid() does this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $translator = $this->getTranslator();
    // ...
    foreach($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
        $element->setTranslator($translator);
    // etc
       


This means that if you've put a translator onto an element, it is overriden by the translator attached to the form. If there is no translator attached to the form, then the translator attached to the element is removed!

Suggested patch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ svn diff library/Zend/Form.php
    Index: library/Zend/Form.php

    +            if ($translator) {
    +                $element->setTranslator($translator);
    +            }
                 if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                     $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
                 } else {

Looking at isValidPartial(), the correct patch is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

             foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
    -            $element->setTranslator($translator);
    +            if (null !== $translator) {
    +                $element->setTranslator($translator);
    +            }
                 if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                     $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
                 } else {

Sorry, Rob, it seems to me you missed the point. Because when setting a translator on Form Level in addition to setting a translator on an Element, the Forms Translator will neverless overwrite the Elements Translator.

Would you mind to have a look at [ZF-9364]?

Duh, or did I? Is the Forms Translator supposed to be more mightful than the Translators on Element Level?

Christian,

You're right in that if there is a forms level translator, it should override the element one. It has to be like that in order to preserve B/C.

This issue is concerned with the case when you don't have a forms level one but do have an element level. Prior to this path, the element level was was removed even though there was no forms level translator to replace it.

Regards,

Rob...
