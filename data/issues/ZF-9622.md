### Description

In the online reference the navigation to the chapter Zend\_Feed\_Writer is missing. After Zend\_Feed\_Reader you just can navigate to Zend\_Feed\_Pubsubhubbub.

When you enter the URL manually [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.10/en/zend.feed.writer.html) the page exists.

This bug exists in all languages but german.

Can someone change the component from Zend\_Feed to Zend\_Feed\_Writer? I think that Padraic can change this issue more quickly then Alex :).
