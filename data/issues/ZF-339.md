### Description

When dumping utf-8 text posted from form using Zend::dump there are corrrupted Polish chars. When dumping using var\_dump() everything is ok.

That bug is connected with htmlentities() function.

This is line from Zend::dump: {quote} <?php htmlentities('ąźęćłżóń',null); ?> {quote} National chars are corrupted because iso-8859-1 character set is used

And this code works properly: {quote} {quote}

There I've described solution. This problem occurs not only in Polish, but in other languages too :))

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
