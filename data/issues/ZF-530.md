### Description

When starting the server, I got a nasty fatal error because I didn't have the pcntl extension complied in. I suggest adding a check using function\_exists() or extension\_loaded() to make sure pcntl is available, and if it isn't, die with a nice error.

Patch adding a check in the constructor to make sure the pcntl functions exists, and throws an exception if not.
