### Description

Firstly, apologies if this is the wrong medium to report this - am quite new to the framework.

I am trying to download the demo for the tutorials. It says to use:

svn checkout <http://framework.zend.com/svn/laboratory/>

or

svn checkout <http://framework.zend.com/svn/laboratory/zfdemo>

However I keep getting asked for a username and password. I have tried my Zend account but am not getting anywhere.

I can't see mention of a username or password. Am I doing something wrong?

The SVN layout was restructured in May of this year. Use <http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/laboratory> as the root instead.
