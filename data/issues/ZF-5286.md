### Description

Some services, especially those created before September 2004 (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3902.txt>) don't know about the "application/soap+xml" media type. I need a way to set the content-type to 'text/xml', which is what one particular service is expecting. Zend\_Soap\_Client doesn't currently provide a method for that.

How would you do that with the php5 SoapClient extension?

This should be possible with the 'stream\_context' option for SoapClient. I had been working on a patch but I think I've run into this bug: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=46427>

It looks like I'm able to use content-type: text/xml by reverting to soap1.1, using the option 'soap\_version' => SOAP\_1\_1

I still think that Zend\_Soap\_Client should allow the user to add stream\_context, does anyone else agree? If nobody else chimes in, I'll just mark this issue as resolved.

hello stephan,

i think its a valuable option that should be supported. I'll look into it.

New methods setStreamContext/getStreamContext added aswell as setOptions 'stream\_context' variable.

Also your bug does not apply here since the context is saved as a class variable and will not be deleted through the course of the request.
