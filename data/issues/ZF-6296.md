### Description

Currently, the router has many flaws and drawbacks, which this refactoring is going to solve. This includes usability of the router, as well as performance and code-cleaning. Will be worked out with a mini proposal post 1.8.

This issue is to be solved with ZF 2.0, as it involves many BC-breaks. A quick and short list of possible changes:

- Removing getInstance(), instead \_\_construct($options)
- Making getDefaults(), getDefault() of routes interface methods
- Making getCurrentRoute() and getCurrentRouteName() interface methods
- CS Cleanup
- Using match(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http $request) in the interface
- Allowing request-method routing per route
