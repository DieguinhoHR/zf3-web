ZF-7481: Zend\_Filter\_HtmlEntities legacy constructor is not handled properly
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-08-04T23:17:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-24T14:52:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.3 (22/Sep/09)

### Description

The updated Zend\_Filter\_HtmlEntities constructor to favor a single options array does not translate the deprecated constructor call properly. While the backwards compatibility code path retrieves the functions argument array (line 67) it does not make any use of it (lines 68 and 70), causing a notice to be emitted and resulting in ignoring the passed in charset argument.

Patch to fix replace the $options in lines 68 and 70 with $argv.
