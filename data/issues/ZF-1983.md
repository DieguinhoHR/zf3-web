ZF-1983: Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page when using a cache\_dir that has a relative path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When you use the Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page and your cache\_dir has a relative path, the caching doesn't work. If we add chdir(dirname($\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_FILENAME'])); to the \_flush callback, we can fix the problem. Is there any other solution?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function _flush($data)
    {
        chdir(dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])); // <-- added
        $this->save($data);
        return $data;
    }


Explaination :

Some web servers (e.g. Apache) change the working directory of a script when calling the callback function. You can change it back by e.g. chdir(dirname($\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_FILENAME'])) in the callback function.

p.s. Testing server: WinXP Apache HTTPD 2.2.4 + Openssl 0.9.8e PHP 5.2.3

can you try to open the Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php file and to change the line "$this->setOption('cache\_dir', $value);" (function setCacheDir()) with "$this->setOption('cache\_dir', realpath($value));" ?

thanks

sorry it's the line "$value = rtrim($value, '\\/') . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR;" which have to be replaced by "$value = rtrim(realpath($value), '\\/') . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR;"

Meanwhile I got a new computer with a different OS so I can't test it on the same configuration. Well.. on Vista it works OK without adding the realpath function & it works also with the added realpath function.
