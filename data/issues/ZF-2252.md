### Description

Example 13.1 published in Zend\_Feed overview (<http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.html>) doesn't work. Slashdot started to serve feeds in RSS 1.0 and, according to ZF-405, Zend\_Feed is unable to parse RSS 1.0 due to bug ZF-26.

I would suggest to change example with a working one, at least untile ZF-405 will be fixed.

Additionally, what about including a note in the official Zend\_Feed documentation about the lack of RSS 1.0 support? It may also point to ZF-405. I think this is a major issue that needs to be reported. Have a look at [http://nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154…](http://www.nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154.html#a14108105)

Assigned to Alexander who, according to [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Web+Services+Team), is the new Zend\_Feed component coordinator.

This issue will be solved because ZF-26 an ZF-405 are fixed.
