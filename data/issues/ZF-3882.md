### Description

The current InArray implementation does not support nested arrays. Which makes it unusable for selects with optgroups (for example). Have such functionality will enable this functionality.

This is a huge downfall. It's creating a usability issue with my form. I can extend it; however, this should be a default feature. Is it too late to be added to 1.6? Perhaps for 1.6.1?

Just like to point out that I found two work-arounds for this. The first is the easiest and that is if you are retrieving valid items from a database, then whenever you iterate through to create the optgroup items, add the valid values to a new array and pass it in as a parameter to the InArray validator.

The other option is to override the InArray validator and add another method. I called it calculateValids() and here is it's construct:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Validators_InArray extends Zend_Validate_Abstract
    {
        CONST NOT_IN_ARRAY = 'notInArray';
        
        protected $_messageTemplates = array(
            self::NOT_IN_ARRAY => '\'%value%\' was not found in the haystack',
        );
        
        protected $_haystack;
        
        protected $_strict;
        
        public function __construct(array $haystack, $strict=false)
        {
            $this->setHaystack($haystack)
                ->setStrict($strict);
        }
        
        public function calculateValids($array)
        {
            $valids = array();
            foreach($array as $key=>$value)
            {
                if(is_array($value))
                    $valids = array_merge($valids, $this->calculateValids($value));
                else
                    $valids[] = $key;
            }
            return $valids;
        }
        
        public function getHaystack()
        {
            return $this->_haystack;
        }
        
        public function setHaystack(array $haystack)
        {
            $this->_haystack = $this->calculateValids($haystack);
            
            return $this;
        }
        
        public function getStrict()
        {
            return $this->_strict;
        }
        
        public function setStrict($strict)
        {
            $this->_strict = $strict;
            return $this;
        }
        
        public function isValid($value)
        {
            $this->_setValue($value);
            if(!in_array($value, $this->_haystack, $this->_strict))
            {
                $this->_error();
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    }


Not the prettiest; however, it works :) Hopefully this can make it in to the next release or minor release.

I looked into the code of Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi, because I wanted to implement my own isValid method on a province select element. To my surprise, I found that validation of optgroups is supported. It works very well. The problem in my case was that I add added the multioptions in the render method, which is far to late for the validator to work (the validator will have no options at its disposal at all!).

After I implemented the getMultiOptions method to return a fixed set of provinces, validation worked just fine. So I wonder if this issue should not be marked as resolved?
