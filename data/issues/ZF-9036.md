### Description

I am building a simple tool which can access the contactlist from a MSN Live account but something is bugging me. I am using a Zend\_Http\_Client object to do all the calls and I am using the Zend\_Http\_Cookiejar to store cookies in. During the calls the cookies get properly saved with host ".live.com" so they are accessible from all subdomains. I tried getting the cookie by:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cookiejar = $client->getCookieJar();
    $authcookie = $cookiejar->getCookie('<a href="">http://.live.com</a>', 'MSPAuth');


This gives me an Exception with "Invalid URI supplied" as message. When i remove the dot from the URI I don't get an exception but the CookieJar won't return the cookie since the host doesnt match (live.com != .live.com). When I remove the check for the hostname in Zend\_Uri the ".live.com" hostname is working fine like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $uri = Zend_Uri::factory();
    $uri->setHost('.live.com');
    $authcookie = $cookiejar->getCookie($uri, 'MSPAuth');


Please fix, tnx :)
