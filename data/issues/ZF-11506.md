### Description

There are a couple of places that Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli checks for a connection. Why do these checks not utilize mysqli\_ping?

I am running into instances where I am getting a "MySQL Server has gone away" error, and I believe if we used mysqli\_ping in the two places I've pointed out in the patch file, you would have a better chance of not getting that error message.
