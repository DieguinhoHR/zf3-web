Also, I would suggest to separate the http-method verification (just below the "// ensure correct curl call" comment) in a different method, like validate() or something, in such a way I can extend the component in a new class and overwrite the method.

Is there any progress for this ticket?

If not, I'd like to adapt the changes that have been made in ZF2 for that issue:

<https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1877> <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1856>

And extend the LINK and UNLINK methods.
