ZF-6008: Zend\_Amf\_Server setClassMap doesn't work for binding multiple AS classes with a single PHP class

### Description

If I map two remote classes to the same local class (AmfRequestBody, or something like that) the array\_flip call in TypeLoader::getMappedClassName() nukes the other entries.

The current implementation does not allow for multiple classes to be mapped to a single class on the PHP side. This may not be a bug - please feel free to mark as an enhancement, as it's something that might be wanted under certain circumstances.

Can you give a use case for this? I'm not really sure how a one to many mapping could be created.
