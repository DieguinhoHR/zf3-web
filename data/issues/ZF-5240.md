### Description

When forwarding to an action that changes the default viewscript via $this->\_helper->viewRenderer('viewscriptname'), ZF tries to use the default viewscript for that new action. I didn't have a viewscript with the default name "index.phtml" for the indexAction that I forwarded to, so ZF threw exception:

Zend\_View\_Exception: script 'newaction/index.phtml' not found in path...

..when it should be using 'viewscriptname.phtml' since in the indexAction I have the line: $this->\_helper->viewRenderer('viewscriptname');

set component and auto reassign

There might be some problem with the order of operations. Can you please provide us with test code?

Ideally, code for the whole controller that misbehaves.
