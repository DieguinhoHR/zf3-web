### Description

Atom Tombstone draft spec: [http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/…](http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-snell-atompub-tombstones/)

Though the draft is expired, there is talk of using this spec in pubsubhubbub to signal a removed entry.

Currently, Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry is not easily extendable to this level.

Fixed in r20518 - see feed level createTombstone/addTombstone. Operates on par with a normal Entry. The classes start with Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Deleted (the data container API).
