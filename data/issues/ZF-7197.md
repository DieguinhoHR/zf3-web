### Description

Hi,

I think it might be a good option to add a sort possibility for translated select options.

Suppose you get a list of country codes out of the DB and you map it to translation keys:

Array ( [ad] => lbl\_country\_ad [ae] => lbl\_country\_ae [af] => lbl\_country\_af [ag] => lbl\_country\_ag [ai] => lbl\_country\_ai ... )

After translating (which the select element does nicely), you get following multi-options:

Array ( [ad] => Andorra [ae] => United Arab Emirates [af] => Afghanistan [ag] => Antigua and Barbuda [ai] => Anguilla ... )

As you can see the 2nd element looks out of place in a drop down box. You would expect it at the end with the other countries starting with U.

I propose adding a callback (null by default) to a sort function in Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi. If a the callback is not null, it will be called to sort the multi options after they have been set.

Any thoughts, ideas,...?

Jeroen

<?php

/\*\* \* Multiselect \* \* @package default \*/ class My\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect extends Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multiselect {

 
    /**
     * Sort options
     * (call after adding the options)
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function sort()
    {
        asort($this->options);
    }


}

Simple solution: Use a ORDER BY in your sql query. or:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->foo->setMultiOptions(asort($options));
