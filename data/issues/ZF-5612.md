### Description

I have an index built and optimised with the engine (latest 1.7.2) which contains around 1020000 documents, a simple search with just 1 or 2 criteria which should returns around 1000 entries spent ~30 seconds but I have another index built with Java Lucene engine on the same documents uses less than 1 seconds to return the 1000 entires; this indicated that the PHP search engine is not much productive

I think this issue depends on ZF-4997.

Hi Satoru,

I've built a very fast CJK analyser which has its performance close to its Java implementation in Apache Lucene sand box which has been used for building the relevant search index. IMHO, its item fetch mechanism from the segment files are slow.

Satoru: I don't think it's a [ZF-4997] related issue. [ZF-4997] describes indexing problem and doesn't affect search time (excepting query parsing time, but parsing itself is really not too long)

Richard: Could you give an example of index and query for testing? (If it's possible, please attach it to the issue or send it directly to me - alexander.v@zend.com)

Reduced priority, as improvements do not block existing applications from being executed.
