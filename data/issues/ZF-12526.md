Just to let ZF-people know: This also affects the latest version 1.12.3.

@Jari If the affected version is 1.12.1 and the issue is not fixed, then the problem is also included in version 1.12.3. ;)

to fix that, just add a missing parameter Gdata.php Line 123+124

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function import($uri, $client = null,
            $className='Zend_Gdata_Feed', $useObjectMapping = true)
