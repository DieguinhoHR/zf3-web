ZF-9454: Using $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] in the CLI environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

ZendFramework-1.10.2\\library\\Zend\\Tool\\Framework\\Client\\Console ArgumentParser.php line: 120

 
    // check to see if the first cli arg is the script name
        if ($this->_argumentsWorking[0] == $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME' ]) {
    
            array_shift($this->_argumentsWorking);
    
        } 


Here you use $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] global variable in the CLI environment, but if you look in the PHP Manual ([http://php.net/manualen/â€¦](http://php.net/manualen/reserved.variables.server.php)), at the INDICES part, you will find the text saying: "You may or may not find any of the following elements in $\_SERVER. Note that few, if any, of these will be available (or indeed have any meaning)if running PHP on the command line. "

When i tried to run the zf.sh i got the error "Action '.../zf.php' is not a valid action." This was because $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is NULL in the CLI environment. But when i removed the "if" statement (as you can see below), then it worked just fine and I was able to run the "zf show version" command without errors. // check to see if the first cli arg is the script name array\_shift($this->\_argumentsWorking);

What environment are you on, b/c I cannot reproduce an environment where SCRIPT\_NAME is not available.

I just hit this problem on one of my boxes. The server is running CentOS 5.5, and also the fcgi version of PHP (not sure if that is relevant - version in this case is 5.2.14). SCRIPT\_NAME is set when using PHP normally, but from the command line the variable is null, as in the reporter's case.

Perhaps a reasonable fix, if $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is not set, would be to check if the first argument ends with 'zf.php'.

Let me know if you need any more environment info or a fix tested.

Okay, this was actually a configuration problem on my side. Because of an incorrect path I'd put in, zf.sh was picking up the normal PHP binary instead of the php-cli. So that may well be the cause if anyone else hits this issue.

Perhaps the fix suggested above could be put in anyway, or if SCRIPT\_NAME should always be available to php-cli then an error could be output if it is null, just to help debug problems like this.
