### Description

In ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_JQuery\_Container when the \_renderExtras method is executed, it calls a number of actions to performed at the document.ready event. However, this call explicitly uses the $ to grab the document element and does not check to see whether or not noConflict mode has been enabled for the jQuery lib. This call needs to check to see which jQueryHandler should be used.
