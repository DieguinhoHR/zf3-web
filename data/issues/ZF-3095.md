### Description

Appears that calling _Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap::getFolders_ with an invalid parameter will cause a PHP warning to be thrown as Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap will attempt to iterate over a boolean value.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap(array(..., 'ssl' => 'SSL'));
    $folders = $mail->getFolders('DoesNotExist');


this will eventually end up calling the following code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function listMailbox($reference = '', $mailbox = '*')
        {
            $result = array();
            $list = $this->requestAndResponse('LIST', $this->escapeString($reference, $mailbox));
            if (!$list) {
                return $result;
            }
    
            foreach ($list as $item) {
                if (count($item) != 4 || $item[0] != 'LIST') {
                    continue;
                }
                $result[$item[3]] = array('delim' => $item[2], 'flags' => $item[1]);
            }
    
            return $result;
        }


Which will cause a PHP Warning when it tries to loop through $list as $list is a _bool(true)_ and not an array.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Good catch. It seems a bit strange, that you don't get an error with an invalid reference, but it's now checked.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
