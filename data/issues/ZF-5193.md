### Description

The SOAP Wsdl Parser is needed for 2 reasons:

1. if a well tested parser exists, one can switch all wsdl and autodiscover unittests to using the parser instead of matching the complete xml string.
2. for Zend\_Tool a build Provider to create SOAP Clients from WSDL definition files would be a great asset.

There are already classes Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Parser\* stuff, but they are not really part of the current SOAP distribution.
