### Description

After authenticated on Active Directory using Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap as my adapter, i can call getLdap(), returning the Zend\_Ldap object used to authenticated.

The problem is when I do searches: everytime it's necessary to bind. I don't if this is default or not, but it's so boring.

Wouldn't be nice if there was a "auto-bind" function inside search function? Afterall, The options are already set there, including username and password posted by user.

Please, thanks and sorry in advance if I said something wrong. Im new here and a eternal apprentice. :}

Should rather be an Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap issue.

Are you using the membership-feature (using the group-setting not being null)? If so the auth-adapter must rebind with the user given in the adapter options to prevent access restriction problems.

Would be these options?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Auth_Adapter_Ldap (line 380)
    
            $adapterOptions = array(
                'group'       => null,
                'groupDn'     => $ldap->getBaseDn(),
                'groupScope'  => Zend_Ldap::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB,
                'groupAttr'   => 'cn',
                'groupFilter' => 'objectClass=groupOfUniqueNames',
                'memberAttr'  => 'uniqueMember',
                'memberIsDn'  => true
            );


I didn't know about those options. So I guess group may still ```.

My login is working perfectly, as my searches. The only "problem" is that before every search I must bind again.

The options should be fine. Could you please provide some sample code of what you're doing so that I can build a test-case to replicate your issue?

Options

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ldap.default.host = "primolan.primolan.com.br"
    ldap.default.accountDomainName = "primolan.com.br"
    ldap.default.accountDomainNameShort = "primolan"
    ldap.default.accountCanonicalForm = 3
    ldap.default.baseDn = "DC=primolan, DC=primolan, DC=com, DC=br"


Login

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance()->setStorage(new Zend_Auth_Storage_Session($this->getRequest()->getModuleName()));
    $adapter = new Zend_Auth_Adapter_Ldap($options, $params['username'], $params['password']);
    $result = $auth->authenticate($adapter);
    $ldap = $adapter->getLdap();


Search

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ldap->bind($username, $password);
    $result = $ldap->searchEntries($filters, $ldap->getBaseDn(), Zend_Ldap::SEARCH_SCOPE_SUB);


Without that _$ldap->bind()_, searchEntries doesn't work.

OK - thanks for your efforts.

Currently I can't think of a reason why this would not work - but let me check this. I'll have a look into this tomorrow.

Should be fixed in trunk (r18878) and 1.9-release branch (r18882)
