### Description

Hi,

there is a missing apostrophe in the Zend\_Form docs and because of it, syntax coloring is wrong in

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.forms.html#zend.form.forms.custom)

in xml it is on line 1569: $password = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Password('password);
