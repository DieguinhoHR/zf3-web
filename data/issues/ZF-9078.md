ZF-9078: Zend\_Measure\_Abstract: Precision detection on type change possible bug
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-04T00:18:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-05T01:59:40.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)

### Description

Dears,

In this code (line 287)

$slength = strlen($value); $length = 0; for($i = 1; $i <= 25; ++$i) { if ($value[$slength - $i] != '0') { $length = 26 - $i; break; } }

$this->\_value = Zend\_Locale\_Math::round($value, $length); $this->\_type = $type;

A possible error can occur if $slength is < 25... We will have $value[$indexNegative]. A simple fix would be

for($i = 1; $i <= $slength && $i <= 25; ++$i) {

Regards,

Raphaël Dehousse

This has been introduced in revision 18493:

[ZF-8009] Zend\_Measure:

- added precision detection on type change

Closing as non-issue. The code works as intended and throws no warning or error.

Thomas,

With all the respect I owe you, I do not understand why a notice is not considered as a possible bug. With this code, I get notices than causes unit tests to fail. A simple fix I provided you resolve the problem. Why not integrate it?

Regards,

Raphaël Dehousse

If the strlen($value) == 0, then, the index will be -1 => notice

I will try to give you a test case to reproduce this

$time = new Zend\_Measure\_Time(0, Zend\_Measure\_Time::SECOND);

$time->setType(Zend\_Measure\_Time::SECOND);

Uninitialized string offset: -1

Zend/Measure/Abstract.php:293

This is because with 0, strlen($value) = 1,

for($i = 1; $i <= 25; ++$i) { if ($value[$slength - $i] != '0') { $length = 26 - $i; break; } }

$value[1 - 1] == 0 => won't break $value[1 - 2] => negative offset...

Won't occur with $i <= $slength

Thank for your help :)

Regards

Raphaël Dehousse

Dear Thomas,

I really like the Zend Framework and I think that I have shown good will by providing patches to the issues I reported.

Would it be possible to see any action from you? A response?

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

The input value is fixed to a length of 25 by using Zend\_Locale\_Math. Using your example code, a vardump of $value on line 290 returns: string '0.0000000000000000000000000' (length=27)

Therefor still not reproducable. (speaking of revision 20096 or higher)

PS: Please note that I am always replying, even if I am one week away due to my real live job or because I am working on other issues... no reason to get impatient.

Dear Thomas,

First, please accept my excuses about my many comments.

Let's back to the issue :)

I tested on Linux and on Windows and indeed, the result is different. On Windows, if I dump $value line around 289-290, I receive string(27) "0.0000000000000000000000000". On Linux, I receive : string(1) "0".

So, the "problem" could be here. Then the issue is maybe in Zend\_Locale\_Math?

PS: I tested against ZF 1.10.1 and 1.10.2

Best regards,

Raphaël Dehousse

Note: When you say that unittests fail it is always recommended, and in my eyes useful, when you provide the returned informations from unittests to see which test fails on which line with which returned value.

And we need also some other informations for reproducation in all issues: \* PHP release? \* BCMath available? \* Used locale

Test:

$ cat DummyTest.php <?php

require\_once('Zend/Measure/Time.php');

class DummyTest extends PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase {

 
        public function testTime()
        {
                $locale = new Zend_Locale();
                var_dump((string) $locale);
    
                var_dump(Zend_Locale_Math::isBcmathDisabled());
    
                $time = new Zend_Measure_Time(0, Zend_Measure_Time::SECOND);
                $time->setLocale($locale);
    
                $time->setType(Zend_Measure_Time::SECOND);
        }


}

Test output:

$ phpunit DummyTest.php PHPUnit 3.4.6 by Sebastian Bergmann.

string(5) "en\_US" bool(true) E

Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.75Mb

There was 1 error:

1) DummyTest::testTime Uninitialized string offset: -1

/usr/share/php5/Zend/Measure/Abstract.php:292 /home/rdehouss/DummyTest.php:12

FAILURES! Tests: 1, Assertions: 0, Errors: 1.

With bcmath compiled with php, the problem does not occur:

$ phpunit DummyTest.php PHPUnit 3.4.6 by Sebastian Bergmann.

string(5) "en\_US" bool(false) .

Time: 1 second, Memory: 5.75Mb

OK (1 test, 0 assertions)

Do you want I create another bug for Zend\_Locale\_Math\_PhpMath and let this one closed?

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2010-03-03T12:18:42.000+0000

You said that unitests fail..

So I don't need a new test from you, but the information which unittests from ZF fail, with the exact failure, the exceptionstack and so on.

Give me not only the unitests from Zend\_Measure but also the testresults from Zend\_Locale\_AllTests. These tests are deeper.

Thnx

PS: Please use styling and don't write code plaintext.

At last I was able to reproduce with a different code than yours.

Fixed with r21330
