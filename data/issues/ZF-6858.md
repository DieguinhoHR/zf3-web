### Description

I have a form with a file element as such: $image = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File($image); $image->setLabel('Upload picture') ->setRequired(TRUE) ->setDestination($full\_image\_path) ->addFilter('StripTags') ->addFilter('StringTrim') ->addValidator('Size', true, '2MB') ->addValidator('Extension', true, 'jpg,jpeg'); $image->getValidator('Extension')->setMessage('Only Jpeg (.jpg, .jpeg) images allowed'); $form->addElement($image);

Then when I process the form I have the following: $adapter = $form->getElement($image)->getTransferAdapter(); $filename = $adapter-getFileName(); When the name of the file uploaded uses non latin characters then the file name returned is empty with only the file extension (.jpg, for instance). The file is uploaded normally.

Tested with filename containing Hebrew, Arabic, Thai and Russian characters.

 <?php echo $form->render(new Zend\_View());?>

Thank you for the detailed answer. I'll have to think of a workaround to this.

When you know a workaround feel free to give us the information. Maybe we can include such a workaround also within the framework itself.
