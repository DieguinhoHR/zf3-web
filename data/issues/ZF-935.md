### Description

If multiple calls to Zend\_Db\_Select::from() are made in a Zend\_Db\_Select instance, new correlation names are auto-generated and unnecessary INNER JOIN are added. This affects performance and can severely impact the expected results of a query.

For example, the following query:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from('my_table', 'id');
    $select->from('my_table', 'name');
    $select->from('my_table', 'description');


_Expected result:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT
        my_table.`id`,
        my_table.`name`,
        my_table.`description`
    FROM `my_table` my_table


_Actual result:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT
        my_table.`id`,
        my_table_2.`name`,
        my_table_3.`description`
    FROM `my_table` my_table
     INNER JOIN `my_table` my_table_2
     INNER JOIN `my_table` my_table_3


I can see where auto-renaming could be useful, but would it be possible to ignore this rule for 'from' statements so that queries can be built atomically?

The intention was to make a simple interface for people to generate self-joins.

But you're right, this makes it necessary to list all columns from a given table instance in one call to from(). That is, currently the way to get what you expect is the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from('my_table', array('id', 'name', 'description'));


But I can understand that sometimes you might not have the list of column names prepared at the time you want to add them to the query. You might have some logic to go through to decide if you need given columns.

I think the best way to preserve the ability to do self-joins and also allow multiple from() calls for a single table instance is that the user must specify the correlation name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from(array('my_table' => 'm'), 'id');
    $select->from(array('my_table' => 'm'), 'name');
    $select->from(array('my_table' => 'm'), 'description');


Whereas omitting the correlation name always results in generating a new correlation name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from('my_table', 'id');          // cname = my_table
    $select->from('my_table', 'name');        // cname = my_table_2
    $select->from('my_table', 'description'); // cname = my_table_3


Currently the code throws an exception if you specify a correlation name that is already in use (cf. line 350 of Select.php).

This solution could also apply to join() by the way:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from(array('my_table' => 'm'), 'id');
    $select->join(array('contact_table' => 'o'), '', 'fax_number');
    $select->join(array('contact_table' => 'o'), '', 'mobile_number');


In the above example, both fax\_number and mobile\_number are taken from the table instance with the correlation name 'o'. The specified in the second call to join() is ignored; the condition specified in the first call takes priority.

The risk is that people make "cut & paste" mistakes, so they might end up using the same correlation name repeatedly by mistake. Throwing an exception when the correlation name is used a second time was an effort to catch this mistake.

A possible compromise would be to throw an exception if the user specifies a correlation name that was used previously, but the table specified in the from() or join() doesn't match the one previously defined for that correlation name. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select();
    $select->from(array('my_table' => 'm'), 'id');
    $select->join(array('contact_table' => 'm'), '', 'fax_number');


The join() above is an error because 'm' is already used, and it is used by a different table than that mentioned in the join() call.

I like the sound of the comprise - it's going to be a lot more natural to use that way and the enforcement of unique correlation names is less intrusive but still as effective.

My original thinking for only applying this to 'from' statements was derived from the usage of select() currently - with a from() method you never specify the 'where' criteria, so it implies that you can build those atomically. Whereas all the 'join' methods you DO supply the where criteria so it implies that the method is to be called only once.

IMO there should be an exception thrown if you try to resupply the criteria to a join where the correlation name already exists - if you wish to 'add' fields to an existing correlation you should supply a null value to the criteria.

Would that help clarify usage?

Assigning to [~peptolab] to be resolved with the approved Zend\_Db\_Table enhancements proposal.

Resolved by using the new columns() method introduced in trunk r9057
