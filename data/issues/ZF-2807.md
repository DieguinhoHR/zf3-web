Why are you using strings consisting of simply multiple zeros as values?

In the current code, we check to see if an option value is in the array of selected values. Interestingly, we have the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (in_array($value, $selected, 0 === $value)) {
    }


Basically, if the option value is an integer zero, we force a strict type comparison.

We _could_ potentially change this to _always_ be strict, but that means you'd never be able to pass in an int zero _or_ a string zero -- only a zero in the exact type as provided. This could pose issues when re-populating a form with submitted data, which is always using strings.

The big issue, here, though, is that you're using equivalent string values, which is going to cause issues regardless.

Will not fix; submitted code will cause issues in most situations regardless.
