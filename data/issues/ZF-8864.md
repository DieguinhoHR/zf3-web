### Description

If i call Flickr Service with i.E. "content\_type" i get an exception. This is because not all flickr api options are currently supported.

The problem are this methods:

- validateTagSearch
- validateUserSearch
- validateGroupPoolGetPhotos

The list of options must be synchronized with the list of options i.E. at [http://flickr.com/services/api/…](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $flickr = new Zend_Service_Flickr($apiKey);
    $results = $flickr->tagSearch("inmon,cms", array('tag_mode' => 'all', 'content_type' => 2));
    foreach ($results as $result) {
         echo '<img alt="' . $result->Square->uri . '" src="'%20.%20$result-"></img>';
    }

Attached is a patch that adds extra options. This should get rid of your problem.
