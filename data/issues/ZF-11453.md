### Description

Using HTML5 doctype does not ensure the and tags are closed, generating non-standard HTML5 code, according to W3C validation process.

At _Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta_ line _359_: $tpl = ($this- >view->doctype()- >isXhtml()) should be: $tpl = ($this- >view->doctype()- >isXhtml() || $this- >view->doctype()- >isHtml5()) to ensure that HTML5 is closed.

At _Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta_ line _362_: } elseif ($this- >view->doctype()- >isXhtml()) { should be: } elseif ($this- >view->doctype()- >isXhtml() || $this- >view- >doctype()- >isHtml5()) { to ensure that the other type of tag is closed.

At _Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadLink_ line _289_: $link .= ($this- >view- >doctype()- >isXhtml()) ? '/>' : '>'; should be: $link .= ($this- >view- >doctype()- >isXhtml() || $this- >view- >doctype()- >isHtml5()) ? '/>' : '>'; to ensure the tag is closed.
