### Description

I have a simple form with a display group.

When trying to render the group separately in the view script, eg. <?php echo $this->form->myGroup ?>, the group is rendered without a fieldset although such decorator exists.

When rendering with <?php echo $this->form->myGroup->render($this) ?>, the fieldset is added as expected.

I tracked this down to the getView() method of Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup. It seems like this method simply returns $this->\_view, unlike other getView() methods that use the viewRenderer helper to return the default view.
