ZF-8590: Broken require\_once() in Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Storage/Queue.php
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In [19821] Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Storage/Queue.php contains a broken include statement:

Warning: require\_once(Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/SharedKeyCredentials.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Users/andreas/Documents/Workspaces/BrainStore/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Storage/Queue.php on line 26

Obsviously credentials moved into their own directory, but the require\_once was not update.

This should be the correct statement: require\_once 'Zend/Service/WindowsAzure/Credentials/SharedKey.php';
