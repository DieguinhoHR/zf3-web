I investigated the issue and this is caused by XDebug.

According to the following comment [http://php.benscom.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://php.benscom.com/manual/en/reserved.variables.php#49316) the variable $php\_errormsg is not populated if you have XDebug running.

It means the variable will be used for the first time, in case of loadXML statement failure. The following line

{quote} throw new Zend\_Feed\_Exception("DOMDocument cannot parse XML: $php\_errormsg"); {quote}

will generate a PHP notice

{quote} Undefined variable: php\_errormsg {quote}

retrown by PHPUnit as a PHPUnit\_Framework\_Notice exception.

{quote} 1) testAtomSample3(Zend\_Feed\_ImportTest) Failed asserting that is an instance of class "Zend\_Feed\_Exception". /Users/weppos/Sites/zend.com.framework/trunk/tests/Zend/Feed/ImportTest.php:424 /Users/weppos/Sites/zend.com.framework/trunk/tests/Zend/Feed/ImportTest.php:136 {quote}

The test fails because PHPUnit\_Framework\_Notice is not an instance of Zend\_Feed\_Exception.
