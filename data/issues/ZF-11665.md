### Description

On resource Zend\_Validate.php is as follows:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ...
    // Zend_Validate_Db_Abstract
    "No record matching %value% was found" => "Não foram encontrados registros para %value%",
    "A record matching %value% was found" => "Um registro foi encontrado para %value%",
    ...


And on Zend\_Validate\_Db\_Abstract.php is as follows:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ...
       protected $_messageTemplates = array(
            self::ERROR_NO_RECORD_FOUND => "No record matching '%value%' was found",
            self::ERROR_RECORD_FOUND    => "A record matching '%value%' was found",
       );
    ...


There are only two methods to resolve this problem.

1 - Change the message on the array in all appeals to:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ...
    // Zend_Validate_Db_Abstract
    "No record matching '%value%' was found" => "Não foram encontrados registros para '%value%'",
    "A record matching '%value%' was found" => "Um registro foi encontrado para '%value%'",
    ...


2 - Change the message on the array in Zend\_Validate\_Db\_Abstract.php (I would do this):

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ...
       protected $_messageTemplates = array(
            self::ERROR_NO_RECORD_FOUND => "No record matching '%value%' was found",
            self::ERROR_RECORD_FOUND    => "A record matching '%value%' was found",
       );
    ...

Issue not reproduceable.

In trunk, branch and also within release 1.11.10 both messages from the abstract validator and the original resource file are equal.

See [http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftags%2Frelease-1.11.10%2Fresources%2Flanguages%2Fen%2FZend_Validate.php) and [http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftags%2Frelease-1.11.10%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FValidate%2FDb%2FAbstract.php) for details.

On the repository [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.11/resources) the problem still persists.
