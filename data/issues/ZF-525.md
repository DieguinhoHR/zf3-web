### Description

If you're searching a single index, you use an IndexSearcher with a single index. If you need to search across multiple indexes, you instantiate one IndexSearcher per index, create an array, stick the IndexSearcher instances in the array, and instantiate a MultiSearcher with the array as an argument.
