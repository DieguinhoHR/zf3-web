### Description

The patch has again not been merged to the release branch and was therefore not part of the recent release 1.7.5 (as for the last two before).

Since reopening seems to be not possible for me i added a sub-task for the pending merge. Setting its priority to blocker will perhaps help to get the merging done before the next release...
