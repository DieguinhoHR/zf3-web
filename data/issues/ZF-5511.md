ZF-5511: avoid unnecessary update queries
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-01-10T09:08:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-17T16:19:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Let's say I retrieve a Row from db with $row->prop set to 'prop1'; (ie. 'prop1' is stored in $row->\_cleanData). At this point, if I do $row->save(), no sql update query gets executed (no data was changed)

Now if I do: $row->prop = 'prop1'; $row->save(); In this case an update query gets executed when in fact it's not necessary.

To avoid this, my suggestion would be to update Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::\_\_set, replacing the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$this->_data[$columnName] = $value;
    $this->_modifiedFields[$columnName] = true;

with the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_data[$columnName] = $value;
    if (isset($this->_cleanData[$columnName]) && $this->_cleanData[$columnName] === $value) {
      @unset($this->_modifiedFields[$columnName]);
    } else {
      $this->_modifiedFields[$columnName] = true;
    }

I am inclined to close this as Not An Issue, here is my reasoning:

Databases have lots of features across all vendors. Typically, you could see a stored procedure, trigger or any other number of (on UPDATE / on INSERT) type of data mutations when in fact the data on the application side is still very much the same. I dont think that silent determination is a good idea. Also, the type of functionality you are talking about is very easy to implement if you add the logic to the methods of a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract extended class.

Please reopen and bring to the mailing list if you feel differently.

It would be interesting to see what the impact of such a feature would be in terms of speed and number of queries in an average application. If it would provide a significant performance increase it would be worth adding this as an opt-in feature. Metrics will tell : )
