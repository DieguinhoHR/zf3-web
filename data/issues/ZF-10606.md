### Description

Zend\_Application\_Resource\_View allows the doctype to be configured from application.ini. It would be useful to extend this to stylesheets as well.

Stylesheet requirements can differ between environments. Development might use uncompressed files, while production uses minified versions. Development may use many small files, while production uses a single concatenated file. Capturing these requirements in application.ini keeps the bootstrap and/or the layout slim.

Here's an example of application.ini defining two stylesheets verbosely. In the common case, only the href is truly necessary.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    resources.view.stylesheets.main.href = "/css/main.css"
    resources.view.stylesheets.main.media = "screen"
    resources.view.stylesheets.reset.href = "/css/reset-fonts.css"
    resources.view.stylesheets.reset.media = "screen"
    resources.view.stylesheets.reset.conditional = 0
    resources.view.stylesheets.reset.extras.foo = "bar"


Here's an addition to getView() in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_View to process them:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if (isset($options['stylesheets'])) {
        $defaults = array('href' => null, 'media' => 'screen', 'conditional' => null, 'extras' => null);
        foreach ($options['stylesheets'] as $name => $stylesheet) {
            $params = array_merge($defaults, $stylesheet);
            $this->_view->headLink()->appendStylesheet($params['href'], $params['media'], $params['conditional'], $params['extras']);
        }
    }

Would a placeholder not work just as well? This would also allow you to override the default setting somewhere down the line even as far down as in a view script.
