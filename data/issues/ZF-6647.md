### Description

the getLabel() method of Zend\_Form\_Element does not perform translation as described in the doc ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.i18n.html#zend.form.i18n.standard))

It seems that there is no translator returned in the label decorator for file elements. The method called is Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::getTranslator() which in the end is calling Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::getTranslator()

The code in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract does not return the default translator if there is not a specific one assigned. Replacing the code in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::getTranslator() with the below (from Zend\_Form\_Element::getTranslator()) fixes the problem and make sure the default translators is returned.

 
        if ($this->translatorIsDisabled()) {
            return null;
        }
    
        if (null === $this->_translator) {
            require_once 'Zend/Form.php';
            return Zend_Form::getDefaultTranslator();
        }
        return $this->_translator;

I don't believe that adding the form translator into the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract is the correct fix for this. It would seem that it would be a better fix to put this into the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File area and setting it from there rather than adding additional complexity and coupling the File\_Transfer\_Adapter to the form.

I cannot reproduce this bug in the trunk:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            require_once 'Zend/Translate.php';
            $translate = new Zend_Translate('array', array('foo' => 'bar'), 'en');
    
            Zend_Form::setDefaultTranslator($translate);
            $form = new Zend_Form();
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
            $element->setLabel('foo');
            $form->addElement($element);
            $form->setView(new Zend_View());
    
            $html = (string) $form;

Confirmed Mike's diagnosis -- on trunk, this is working fine. Closing; re-open if you can provide reproduce code off of current trunk that shows labels not being translated.
