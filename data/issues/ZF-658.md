### Description

The controller and action name shouldn't necessarily be specified in the request object's user parameters; it should be possible to specify these keys within the url after the controller and action have been matched. For instance, '/foo/bar/controller/abc' should route to FooController::BarAction, but still have a request parameter of 'controller' mapping to 'abc'.

This can be done pretty easily. As an example, using the controller getter:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getControllerName()
        {
            if (null === ($name = $this->_controllerName)) {
                $name = $this->getParam($this->getControllerKey(), null);
                if (null !== $name) {
                    $this->_controllerName = $name;
                }
            }
    
            return $this->_controllerName;
        }

+1 Here, also changing to major

This is a major issue, developer should be able to use the param name 'action' in the url without it, getting smashed.

Example of a crud controller

/data\_entry/process/action/save/id/5 [post parameters included in request] etc.etc..

In this case, currently, \_getParam('action') would return 'process'

Fixed in revision 2771. Controller and action are now placed in \_controller and \_action properties, respectively.
