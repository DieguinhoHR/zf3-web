ZF-4180: Moves files when it shouldn't

### Description

The code below always fire for me, even though I have a validator . I don't think it's tested by the validator, since I can only find one instance of the words move\_uploaded\_file in my Zend library. My guess is that one really want to test is\_uploaded\_file instead, to make sure its a valid uploaded file.

I validate, as one should, and then try to receive the file. What happens is that the move\_uploaded\_file below renames the file, making it inaccessible to the validators.

FILE: Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Http.php FUNCTION: receive

// Should never go here as it's tested by the upload validator if (!move\_uploaded\_file($content['tmp\_name'], ($directory . $content['name']))) { return false; }

Please define what exactly is your problem. Your example code is not related to Zend\_File\_Transfer.

And what exactly is your problem?

API DOC reads:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Receive the file from the client (Upload)
         *


Which really receives the file. When you want to check the file why don't you simply use isValid() like described in the manual ?

Validation is always done BEFORE moving the file. Looking at the method you are mocking about you will see the isValid is called BEFORE doing move\_uploaded file.

When your validation fails, you should simply look what your validation errors look like.

RECEIVE() RECEIVES THE FILE, WHICH MEANS FOR HTTP THAT IT IS MOVED FROM TEMPORARY LOCATION TO THE SET DIRECTORY. THIS IS NOT A FAILURE, THIS IS EXPECTED AND WISHED BEHAVIOUR.

No error at all... receive MUST receive the file. Validations are always done before. Always look at the example code in the manual for proper handling.
