ZF-10164: assertHeaderContains checks only against the first occurance of a header
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-07-15T20:49:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:46.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

HTTP spec allows certain header types to appear several times in a response. For example: Set-Cookie: name1=val1; ... Set-Cookie: name2=val2; ...

Similarly to assertQueryContentContains($path, $match) which tests _all_ elements matching '$path' against '$match', assertHeaderContains($header, $match) should test whether '$match' matches any header matching '$header' and not only the first one. Currently, the assertHeaderContains assumes that $header is unique, so it matches against the first/random occurrence of that header in the response, which doesn't work with the 'Set-Cookie' example above

Looked further into this issue and it seams to go a bit deeper than the assertHeaderContains function itself. The sendHeaders method of Zend\_Controller\_Response\_HttpTestCase assumes that there's only one header with a given name in the response: foreach ($this->\_headers as $header) { $name = $header['name']; $key = strtolower($name); if (array\_key\_exists($name, $headers)) { if ($header['replace']) { $headers[$key] = $header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value']; } } else { $headers[$key] = $header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value']; } }

So, if 'replace' is true, the second instance will be used, but if it's false, the first instance is used, rather then _both instances_ of the header, which would be the correct behavior.

BTW, the real Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract class does not have this bug, as it correctly uses the 'header' function, that would output multiple headers of the same type, if 'replace' is 'false': foreach ($this->\_headers as $header) { if (!$httpCodeSent && $this->\_httpResponseCode) { header($header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value'], $header['replace'], $this->\_httpResponseCode); $httpCodeSent = true; } else { header($header['name'] . ': ' . $header['value'], $header['replace']); } }

As this looks like a major bug in Zend\_Test, bumping the ticket from 'enhancement' to 'bug'

Attaching a proposed fix (sorry for not creating a proper patch, didn't have time to tweak all the affected places under Zend\_Test\_\*

The proposed fix:

1) in Zend\_Controller\_Response\_HttpTestCase::sendHeaders \* when $header['replace'] is false, instead of ignoring the header, the entry $headers[$key] becomes an array instead of a string \* also, there seems to be a bug in the main 'if': if (array\_key\_exists($name, $headers)) should be if (array\_key\_exists($key, $headers))

2) in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Constraint\_ResponseHeader::\_headerRegex and similar methods \* call $this->\_getHeader as usual to find the header entry \* if a scalar is returned (current functionality), just treat as today \* if an array is returned (this fix), go over all the elements of the returned array and try to match against each one

Hope all this makes sense :)
