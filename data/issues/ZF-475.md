### Description

So, another bug in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client which costs me some hours :-) Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar creates the value-payload from itself by using $this->\_value. But $this->\_value is an escape XML-String and so it comes to the issue, that string becomes encoded twice. Also it creates a XML-payload from iso-8859-1 which is definitely wrong. The patch in the attachment fixes this problem.

The fix here is incorrect. It will continue to double escape the strings. The thing is, if a Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_String object is created, it just encodes the submitted string to make it XML-safe. But: DomElement also encodes the string so getValue() should be used and not $this->\_value.

Took me a bit to figure out where the getValue() should be done, but found it -- it's in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar, and the change is committed in 1474. Please test.

Sorry, I would have explained that better. But it works now.

I do not want to fell on your nerves but I found another related thing. The Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Base64 has a similiar problem. As we are using $this->getValue() now it will return an unencoded binary which is incorrect. As I'm currently using Base64-stuff just for sending, not for receiving I hotfixed that by returning the base64-encoded string, which is incorrect if you receive a string from the server because it will still be base64-encoded. So I guess we ran into a design problem. String values will be encoded twice, as long as we do not $this->getValue() but base64-values will not be encoded, if we use $this->getValue(). I'm not sure currently how to fix this.
