### Description

Zend\_Uri seems to be a bit closed to inheritance.

I made a little patch which permit to specify a custom "adapter" in the factory.

PS : this patch allow to work arround <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47689> (apache crash with long uri).

Thanks for the patch, looks great. It was applied and I added some documentation.

This is now committed to trunk in r.22081, and will be merged into the release branch if approved.

Cheers!
