### Description

I am using the 1.6.2 version and have also checked the 1.7Pr and didn't see the render function accessing the assigned variables. I could not find any reference of the stored variables being used other than their being created. I've posted to the mailing list and send mail directly asking for confirmation and received no response. I figured this would get some kind of response.

Thanks, Terre

File and functions in question : - Zend\\Layout.php --- assign($spec, $value = null) --- \_\_set($key, $value) --- render($name = null)

Task: Assign a variable directly from actionController code to the zend\_layout component instead of using a placeholder tag in the action's template.

Similar to Zend\_Layout::getMvcInstance()->setLayout(tplnamehere) or Zend\_Layout::getMvcInstance()->setLayoutPath(newpath), kinda.

Usage : Zend\_Layout::getMvcInstance()->assign(VARIABLENAME,true);

Problem : Variables assigned to the Zend\_Layout directly do not get passed to the layout view when it is rendered.

-->assign = variable stored in $this->\_container ($this->\_container[$spec] = $value;) -->render = does not access $this->\_container - Even though comment in render function says, "assigns layout variables to view".

-- original render function -- /\*\* \* Render layout \* \* Sets internal script path as last path on script path stack, assigns \* layout variables to view, determines layout name using inflector, and \* renders layout view script. \* \* $name will be passed to the inflector as the key 'script'. \* \* @param mixed $name \* @return mixed \*/ public function render($name = null) { if (null === $name) { $name = $this->getLayout(); }

 
        if ($this->inflectorEnabled() && (null !== ($inflector = $this->getInflector())))
        {
            $name = $this->_inflector->filter(array('script' => $name));
        }
    
        $view = $this->getView();
    
        if (null !== ($path = $this->getViewScriptPath())) {
            if (method_exists($view, 'addScriptPath')) {
                $view->addScriptPath($path);
            } else {
                $view->setScriptPath($path);
            }
        } elseif (null !== ($path = $this->getViewBasePath())) {
            $view->addBasePath($path, $this->_viewBasePrefix);
        }
    
        return $view->render($name);


 }

Fix:

in zend/layout.php render function --- Add after : $view = $this->getView();

 
    // quick and dirty assign stored vars to view
    foreach ($this->_container as $k => $v) {
            $view->$k = $v;
      }

Zend\_Layout::getMvcInstance()->assign('testvar', 'testvalue');

Works without layout.php modification in 1.9.0

I don't know how mark it as fixed though.

Marking as resolved per user input.
