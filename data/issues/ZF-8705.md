### Description

Hello,

I can't add helpers path in \_initView().

I added a path in Bootstrap and when I use my helper, ZF doesn't find it.

Please elaborate what you do.

Hello Dolf,

I develop these lines in my application:

- - - - - -

class Bootstrap extends Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap { protected function \_initView() { $view = new Zend\_View(); $view->addHelperPath( realpath(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../library/System/View/Helper'), 'System\_View\_Helper' ); return $view; } }

- - - - - -

When I try to use any helper in that path, I receive this message exception:

Plugin by name 'Substring' was not found in the registry; used paths: Admin\_View\_Helper\_: /path/to/application/modules/admin/views/helpers/ Zend\_View\_Helper\_: Zend/View/Helper/

ZF ships with a View Resource Plugin. I'd advise to use that, if you do so, you can use: resources.view.helperPath.ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper = "ZendX/JQuery/View/Helper" resources.view.helperPathPrefix.ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper = "ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper"

If you want to stick to using your own init method, please see how the ZF view resource plugin does it all. This file can be found in library/Zend/Application/Resource/View.php .

If you have any problems, please comment.

I'll study this situation. I tried here with my own helper and your configurations and an exception was throwed. Sorry, but my English is too bad. I'm making miracles here.

Then I'll mark this issue for now as not an issue. If it does turn out to be an issue after all (which I do not expect), please reopen this issue.

I have the same problem with ZF 1.10.6

I create the \_initView

add the $view->->addHelperPath(dirname(..) and in the layout Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader doesn't find my helper. And when I debug it, in the path there isn't my helper path.

Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception' with message 'Plugin by name 'SearchForm' was not found in the registry;

Hello dragon,

I'm using ZF 1.10.6 and I did this method in my Application Bootstrap:

- - - - - -

protected function \_initViewHelpers() { /\* @var $layout Zend\_Layout \*/ $layout = $this->bootstrap('Layout')->getResource('Layout');

 
    /* @var $view Zend_View */
    $view = $layout->getView();
    $view->addHelperPath(dirname(APPLICATION_PATH)
        . '/library/System/View/Helper/', 'System_View_Helper_')
    
    /* More Config Options */


}
