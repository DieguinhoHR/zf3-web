ZF-10529: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSubmit should not output id if empty.

### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSubmit, like most of the other form helpers, always includes an id attribute as part of the echoed HTML.

If null is passed in for the $name argument (assuming no id is also passed in $attribs), this results in printing id="", which is not valid HTML. Of course, it's normally a valid assumption that a form element will have a name attribute, but submit elements (and buttons) are the exception where they can serve a useful purpose without a name attribute.

Specifically, if you're creating multiple forms on a page, you may want to re-use the same name attribute in two forms, but obviously, you can't validly re-use the id. Even if you pass a null id to Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSubmit, you get invalid HTML.

Instead, the helper should check if the id is empty, and if so, not output that attribute at all (this is what already occurs in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form).
