### Description

That would be good to have wildcard queries to be implemented.

There was a request for this feature in [FW-General mailing list](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/20497)

I think this feature is very important. Looking for "test" should also find "tests" (by internal adding the "\*").

Yes. I do agree. It's only postponed to the post-1.0 period.

From the other side the functionality you mentioned should be implemented through appropriate Analyzer, which reduces all lexemes to their base-words:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

test => test tests =>test tested => test

testing => test
---------------

Done.
