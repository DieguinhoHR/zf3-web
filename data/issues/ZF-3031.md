### Description

It would help a lot in orientation in the manual, if the page title contained name of the documentation chapter, e.g. "Zend\_View - Zend Framework: Documentation" instead of just "Zend Framework: Documentation".

This is a documentation issue, all yours wil.

It's worthy, but we don't have the resources at Zend to address this right now. We will re-evaluate the change in the future, however.

Changing to correct issue type.

This seems to be simply a limitation of the currently used phpDoc HTML:Frames template type. The main page never changes, thus the title never changes.

May I suggest using one of the Smarty-based templates instead?

Is fixed in the new version, which comes with ZF2 2.1!
