### Description

Read through the issues discussed in ZF-33.

To make it possible to draw on rotated pages without losing your sanity, we need to implement the remainder of the CTM (current transformation matrix) primitives. We already have $page->rotate($x, $y, $degrees). We need to add $page->translate($xOffset, $yOffset) and $page->skew($xAmount, $yAmount).

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Done. Will be included into ZF 1.8.
