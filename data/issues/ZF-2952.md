### Description

I think Zend\_Validate\_inArray should have an option to check for keys of an array istead of values only. It could be done pretty simple.

This is also easily done from userland; for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $objZendValidateInArray->setHaystack(array_keys($aryKeysAreHaystack));

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
