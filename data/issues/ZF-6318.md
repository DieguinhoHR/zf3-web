### Description

In a project proposal I use the namespace feature of PHP 5.3 and tried to integrate it with Zend\_Loader.

The goal is to reduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Some_Rather_Long_Name {}


to something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    namespace Some/Rather/Long;
    class Name {}


which works fine, but needs the following patch to Zend\_Loader::loadClass()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // autodiscover the path from the class name
            $file = str_replace(array('_', '\\'), DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $class) . '.php';


It would be great to have this simple addition in the Zend Framework!

This gain importance as php 5.3 is out. A problem also exists in Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader as it cannot load namespaced view helpers and similar.
