### Description

I had create a Zend\_View, and I wish to use a View Helper that I am using on my proyect. But, I cant. Zend not found the helper. Always show me this error:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception' with message 'Plugin by name 'MyHelper' was not found in the registry;

My helper is in: application/modules/cines/views/helpers

and I wrote this lines: $template = new Zend\_View(); $template->addBasePath(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules/cines/views/');

 
        $template->addHelperPath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/modules/cines/views/');
        $template->addHelperPath(APPLICATION_PATH . '/modules/cines/views/helpers/');


so, what do you think? (it is driving me crazy)

thanks for your help. Mauricio

Closing as not an issue, as this is a support request.

Please direct support requests to either the mailing list, or #zftalk on IRC.

Your code example is also incomplete, and it is not possible to tell if you are using that view instance, or if you are assigning it to the view renderer for use.

Finally, you do not add the prefix for the path which you are adding to the view.
