ZF-2644: Change Zend\_Form\_Element:: addValidator() signature
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I would take out validator's arguments out of the option array and have them stick with validor, It would be easier to read and more in line with Zend\_Filter\_Input

So instead of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->addValidator('StringLength', false, array(6, 20));


We could have:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->addValidator(array('StringLength', 6, 20));


The second argument could also be the breakChainOnFailure or the option array ?

While I appreciate the idea of using a variable number of arguments, this is not a terribly good practice:

- If the second argument could be either breakChainOnFailure _or_ a constructor argument, what happens if the constructor allows a boolean as its first argument?
- Variable arguments mean IDE signature hinting will not work (many developers use IDEs, and variable arguments mean no helpful tooling)
- Having the constructor arguments in an array makes loading from a configuration file easier
