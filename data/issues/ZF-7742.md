### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getOption($key)
        {
            if ($this->hasOption($key)) {
                $options = $this->getOptions();
                $options = array_change_key_case($options, CASE_LOWER);
                return $options[strtolower($key)];
            }
            return null;
        }


hasOption() is case sensitve so it never gets to the strtolowerpart

2 possible solutions:

make getOption() like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getOption($key)
        {
           $key = strtolower($key);
            if ($this->hasOption($key)) {
                $options = $this->getOptions();
                $options = array_change_key_case($options, CASE_LOWER);
                return $options[($key];
            }
            return null;
        }


Or make hasOption, since all options get loaded into lowercase keys anyway:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function hasOption($key)
        {
            return in_array(strtolower($key), $this->_optionKeys);
        }

This is related to ZF-6679

Basically, the intention was that getOptions would preserve the original case, but lookups (getOption and hasOption) would work if you supply a lowercase key or a case sensitive key.

But, passing a key with a capital letter does not work.

Unit tests and fix to allow passing keys with capital letters to getOption and hasOption. getOption didn't need a fix since it was already coded to be case-insensitive, but relied on hasOption which was case-sensitive.

I agree with Travis that hasOption is missing the strtolower functionality and therefore this bug occurs.

Ah, but it is still missing in BootstrapAbstract.php
