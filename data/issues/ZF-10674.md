I have experienced this issue as well, however as the MVC layer of the framework will change, this issue will be resolved with the implementation of the interfaces.

For more information, see the [MVC Interface proposals](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Proposal+for+MVC+Interfaces).

This issue is from an early development release of ZF2, and is because of the MVC reconstruction in ZF2 no longer reconstructable nor relevant.
