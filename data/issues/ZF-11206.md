### Description

This throws a fatal error on urls containing a % inside the get. Like:

<http://www.mysite.com/index.php?page>=% [http://www.mysite.com/index.php?page=%g](http://www.mysite.com/index.php?page=%25g) [http://www.mysite.com/index.php?%=page](http://www.mysite.com/index.php?%25=page) [http://www.mysite.com/index.php?pa%ge](http://www.mysite.com/index.php?pa%25ge)= [http://www.mysite.com/index.php?%page](http://www.mysite.com/index.php?%25page)=

But not on: <http://www.mysite.com/index.php?page=%13>

This is not strictly a bug, as the URL you are providing is indeed not valid. Please specify the error message if you think otherwise.

I agree with Shahar. The % symbol has special meaning in URIs - denotes encoded characters (ie: %20 is the code for an uri-encoded space) - so if you want to include a literal % you should use %25. In your example, the last URI works because %13 is the uri-encoded ASCII character "DC3" (device control 3).
