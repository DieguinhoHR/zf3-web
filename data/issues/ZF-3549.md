ZF-3549: In cloned views, the $view field of helpers still points to original view.

### Description

 
    When a view is cloned, the cloned view has access to all the helpers loaded into the original view. If these helpers have had setView called on them, they will thus have a reference to the original view, rather than a reference to the new, cloned, view.


This is particularly a problem when rendering partials, because using a helper in a partial will cause the helper to interact with the parent view, not the partial.

One way of fixing this would be to add a \_\_clone method to Zend\_View\_Abstract, thus:

 
    public function __clone()


{ $this->\_helper = array(); }

Alternatively, the \_\_clone method could loop through all the helpers and call their 'setView' method.

Partials are aimed at presenting a clean variable scope distinct from the parent view, however this does not extend to View Helpers by design. If you need to alter a View Helper's behaviour between partials then it should be handed a context (i.e. the partial view object, or parameters local to the partial view object) to operate with. Bear in mind, the partial is related to the parent view being its child.
