ZF-7857: Parsing WSDL documents documentation is incorrect

### Description

The (English) documentation states that you can parse your WSDL documents with

$parser = Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Parser::factory($dom); $result = $parser->parse();

This will result in a fatal error thrown by PHP saying the file Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Parser.php can't be found. I've found out that this file has been removed since ZF 1.8.0.

The documentation needs an update for how this is done by the latest releases.

That class is deprecated, please don't use it. The documentation for the WSDL parser made it in there by accedient i guess, I'll remove that immediately.

Removed mention of untested, unmaintained, non-working Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Parser class from the documentation.
