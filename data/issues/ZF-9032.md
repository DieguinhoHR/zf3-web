### Description

The default text of Zend\_Validate\_Digits when validation isn't passed is the following:

 
    * '500.00' contains not only digit characters


An improvement might be something like:

 
    * '500.00' contains characters that are not digits; only digits are allowed

I've updated the patch against trunk as the english grammar was still a little odd. Please review.

Thanks.
