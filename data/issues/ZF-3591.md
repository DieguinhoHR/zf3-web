### Description

When reading an email message from file (imap, eml, ...) the subject's q-encoding isn't decoded at all.

File is read using

new Zend\_Mail\_Message(array('file'=>$filePath));

The File to be read must have an q-encoded subject such as

Subject: =?iso-8859-15?Q?lee=E4r=20=A4?=

I have a similar issue to report, where subjects are not being properly decoded. Here's a message header that reproduces the issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">Message-ID: <488E0442.9040303@xxx.xxx>
    Date: Mon, 28 Jul 2008 20:39:14 +0300
    From: Support 
    User-Agent: Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 (Windows/20080421)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    To: TestBox 
    Subject: Re: =?UTF-8?B?dGVzdC/Qv9GA0L7QstC10YDQutCw?=
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    
    
    Здравейте,
    тест

That's because you've set iconv to an encoding that can't represent the characters (euro sign in the first example, russian chars in the second one). Zend\_Mime\_Decode doesn't touch your iconv settings. If you set iconv.internal\_encoding to UTF-8 in you php.ini or via ini\_set() you'll get the decoded header. Of course the rest of the code needs to be able to handle that encoding.
