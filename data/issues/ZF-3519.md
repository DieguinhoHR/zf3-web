ZF-3519: Multiple filters not working
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-06-26T08:37:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-02-23T10:59:25.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If we want only log two specific level, we will do something like: {quote} $filter1 = new Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority(Zend\_Log::ERR,'eq'); $writer->addFilter($filter1);

 
        $filter2 = new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority(Zend_Log::ALERT,'eq');
        $writer->addFilter($filter2);


{quote} This will only log Zend\_Log::ERR because in the writer, it will be return if we send an event Zend\_Log::ALERT, because the loop will return at the first false match and will not test the second filter. {quote} foreach ($this->\_filters as $filter) { if (! $filter->accept($event)) { return; } } {quote} A possible solution could be: {quote} $accepted= false; foreach ($this->\_filters as $filter) { $accepted= $accepted|| $filter->accept($event); }

if (!$accepted) { return; } {quote}

Avoiding a workaround like: {quote} $filter1 = new Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority(Zend\_Log::ERR); $writer->addFilter($filter1);

 
        $filter2 = new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority(Zend_Log::CRIT,'ne');
        $writer->addFilter($filter2);
    
        $filter3 = new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority(Zend_Log::EMERG,'ne');
        $writer->addFilter($filter3);


{quote}

This is indeed unintended behavior. I'll leave this open so that it will be corrected soon.

As per: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.filters.html) {quote} When you add one or more Filters to the Log object, the message must pass through all of the Filters before any Writers receives it. {quote}

Therefore, when you filter the way you did, the error must both be Zend\_Log::EMERG and Zend\_Log::ALERT at the same time.

Currently, Zend\_Log\_Filter doesn't support an "Or" filter.

Another way to handle it is to filter for all the priorities you do not want.
