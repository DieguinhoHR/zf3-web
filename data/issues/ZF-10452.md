Please note that the data from the Unicode CLDR project can only be fixed by Unicode itself. See <http://unicode.org/cldr> for details.

In the latest Unicode version it is named: Serbia, which is correct. But not in the latest framework version.

Updates for CLDR are only allowed for minor releases as they are threaded as BC breaks. The CLDR release which was available with 1.10.0 is also integrated within 1.10.8.
