Could you indicate what does not work about it, please? What errors are presented? What expectations are not met?

I expect this line of code to has no effect on element decorators. Instead, some decorators are lost. It seems it does not get decorators aliases.

This was corrected with some refactoring done for 1.6.0; you can now pass the results of getDecorators() to setDecorators(), and all aliasing is preserved. A test has been added to verify this.

Test added in trunk and merged to 1.6 release branch.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
