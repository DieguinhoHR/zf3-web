### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Client seems to be broken, or I might have misunderstood the way it works.

Test:

Create rest server using Zend\_Rest\_Server based on a class, exposing 1 method:

parrot($text), returning the input text

Then test calling method directly through url:

http:///server.php?method=parrot&arg1=This%20is%20my%20string

and using Zend\_Rest\_Client:

$rest = new Zend\_Rest\_Client($server); echo $rest->parrot('This is my string')->get();

2nd one fails.

I have attached client and server files to demonstrate the issue.

The bug still exists 6 months later in the version 1.5.

The lines 239 to 242 from the class Zend\_Rest\_Client seem to be the cause of the bug

In fact I do not see what these lines are supposed to do. Removing them fixes the bug.

Looks like issues ZF-2467, ZF-2215, ZF-2044 are all related to this problem.

Does it depend on ZF-4089, doesn't it?

I will be happy if you see and comment on ZF-2215.
