### Description

A bug was brought up by aaroncampbell on the manual for Zend\_Db at 9.1.3.5. Fetching Key-Value Pairs from a Result Set

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $db->setFetchMode(Zend_Db::FETCH_OBJ);
    $result = $db->fetchAAssocssoc('SELECT bug_id, bug_status FROM bugs');
    echo $result[2];


I think it meant fetchAssoc, but this section is about using fetchPairs()

Is this an issue with Zend\_Debug or Zend\_Db? Is this an issue in section 9.1 or 9.11 of the manual (btw, there is no section 9.11)?

I appreciate the issue report, but please try to be more accurate with the details when you make such reports.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db issue. Reword summary.

I see you did say it was _example_ 9.11. I understand now.

Sorry for the confusion, I forgot to place a link there [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.select.fetchpairs) ;)
