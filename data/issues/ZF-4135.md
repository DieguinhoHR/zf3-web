ZF-4135: Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page does not seem to respect custom cache lifetimes

### Description

In the \_flush() function on line 314 of Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page it does not pass the specific lifetime argument to Zend\_Cache\_Core->save()

If this is by design, then the documentation doesn't make it clear that you cannot specify lifetime for Page cached files.
