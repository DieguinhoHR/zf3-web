### Description

If you put a string with with a comma and special chars in the from name, the header get screwed up.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->setFrom('bernd@example.org', 'The rabbit, which is Bernd\'s best frÃ¶nd!');
    $mailHeader = $mail->getHeaders();
    
    echo $mailHeader['From'][0];


this will result in

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    From: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?The_rabbit=2C_which_is_Bernd=27s_best_fr=F6nd=21?= 

the comma will not be encoded in quoted printable and therefor, the sendername will not be quoted so that the email client could not recognize the whole sender name.

Tried to reproduce the behavior, but we could not reproduce it. The comma is ignored (meaning it is not converted to a hex code in \_encodeQuotedPrintable) which is the intended behavior. As stated by the Quoted-printable encoding mechanism, all ASCII codes within the range 33 and 126 should be ignored. The comma falls within this range with it's ASCII code 44.

hi michael,

thanks for your reply.

yes the comma falls within the range - thats okay.

I think the problem is in Zend\_Mail->\_formatAddress.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _formatAddress($email, $name)
    {
        if ($name === '' || $name === null || $name === $email) {
            return $email;
        } else {
            $encodedName = $this->_encodeHeader($name);
            if ($encodedName === $name &&
                    ((strpos($name, '@') !== false) || (strpos($name, ',') !== false))) {
                $format = '"%s" <%s>';
            } else {
                $format = '%s <%s>';
            }
            return sprintf($format, $encodedName, $email);
        }
    }


if $name is set, it will be encoded. So if there is a char which is not in the ASCII range between 33 and 126, this one will be encoded ($encodedName = $this->\_encodeHeader($name);)

But then, the $name will only be double quoted when $encodedName === $name - but this will result in false if there is a char with ASCII code outside of the range 33-126.

This would be the correct string, right?
