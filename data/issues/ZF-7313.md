ZF-7313: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached class named incorrectly
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-07-20T00:02:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-20T07:54:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The current Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached is using the _Memcache_ API from <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php> while the name suggests that it uses the \*Memcache\*\*\_d\_\* API from <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php>

I think there should be two memcached backends: - one named Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcache using the Memcache API - one named Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached using the Memcached API -- would be nice if this one also supports multiGets/sets and the other cool features of memcached

The component was named for the "memcached" daemon, not for the extension it was utilizing. That said, I've been approached by a contributor already who would like to add ext/memcached support (indeed, ext/memcached did not even exist when this backend was originally added).

I'm going to close this issue for now, as we'll need a full proposal in order to add ext/memcached support; we'll revisit the naming issues at that time, as renaming to Memcache and having a Memcached adapter that uses the newer extension will be a BC break.

Not an issue; requires a proposal, and a potential BC break.

Okay, thanks for the update. Sorry about the duplicate, posting the issue took ages so I re-entered it.

I'll start working on a proposal

hmmz, found the [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Cache+refactoring+-+Marc+Bennewitz) proposal, contains exactly what I wanted :)
