### Description

Problem how to build sub-directory based site using ZF, that is mentioned in all ZF versions.

[http://domain.com/project/module/â€¦](http://www.domain.com/project/module/controller/action)

There are many issues refered to this problem, but I want to be resolved for this problem by ZF team. At first, Could you show ZF-users solution to this problem, involving .htaccess and ZF components such as Route etc?

I have to decide whether I use ZF for bulding sub-directory based site or not. I really want to use ZF, but I don't know solution and have not a time. Only I am looking forward to ZF team's help.

Best regards.
