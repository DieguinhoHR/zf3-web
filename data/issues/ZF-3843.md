### Description

The problem occured to me when I tried Zend\_Pdf on an i5. It uses "CP1252//IGNORE" as encoding for iconv which is not supported by AIX. The right encoding for AIX should be "IBM-1252". "//IGNORE" doesn't work altogether. Although it's IBMs fault in my opinion, it prevents the use of a lot of parts of Zend Framework.
