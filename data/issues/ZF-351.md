### Description

I've made some changes to Zend\_Uri\_Http and added a query string parameter to Zend\_Http\_Client::get(). I've also removed Zend\_Uri\_Http::setQueryArray() and Zend\_Uri\_Http::setQueryString() and replaced them with a simpler Zend\_Uri\_Http::setQuery() function.

This takes care of the @todo in Zend\_Http\_Client::get().

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Zend_Uri_Http::setQuery()
    
        public function setQuery($query)
        {
            $queryArray = array();
    
            if (is_array($query)) {
                $queryArray = $query;
            } else if (is_string($query)) {
                parse_str($query, $queryArray);
            }
            if (count($queryArray)) {
                $query = http_build_query($queryArray, '', '&');
            } else {
                throw new Zend_Uri_Exception('Invalid query');
            }
            if ($this->validateQuery($query)) {
                $this->_query = $query;
            }
        }


I made the query string the first parameter because a) I didn't think many people would have set $redirectMax explicitly, and b) it is consistent with post(). If someone needs to set $redirectMax it's easier to set the query to NULL than trying to come up with a $redirectMax each time you need to set a query.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Zend_Http_Client::get()
    
       /**
         * Send a GET HTTP Request
         *
         * @param  array|string $arguments Arguments to pass in the query string
         * @param  int $redirectMax Maximum number of HTTP redirections followed
         * @return Zend_Http_Response
         */
        public function get($query = NULL, $redirectMax = 5)
        {
            if (!is_null($query))
            {
                $this->_uri->setQuery($query);
            }


And on line 105:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                                $this->_uri->setQuery($query);

I prefer not to put too much effort on the Zend\_Http\_Client as it is going to be replaced by the incubator Zend\_Http\_Client which is a complete rewrite.

Do you think this issue concers the new Http\_Client as well? This one has easier access to GET parameters and you could either set them individually using $client->setParameterGet('foo', 'baz'), or directly access the query string by doing this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $client->getUri()->setQuery('foo=baz');


I'm not sure if any further changes are needed. Let me know what you think.

Oh, I didn't know there was a newer version of Zend\_Http\_Client coming. Naturally, any updates to the old one would be a waste of time.

However, the changes to Zend\_Uri\_Http (which are the bulk of my suggestion) would still apply. I would prefer having the choice of using an array or string, and I'm sure others would as well.

The changes to Zend\_Http\_Client also use the native PHP function http\_build\_query(), which renders Zend\_Http\_Client::\_getParametersRecursive() redundant.

I've only taken a couple of minutes to look at the updated Client, but I'm a bit confused why setting GET parameters is handled in two different places--why there is even that option. It seems to me that GET should be in one place. The most obvious choice is in the URI, since Zend\_Uri\_Http is or will be used in places other than Zend\_Http. In that case, you could simply have setParameterGet() should call $this->uri->setQuery().

What do you think?

Incidentally, a single hyphen on either side is probably a poor choice of syntax for "strikethrough"...

I see your point now, and of course using $this->uri->setQuery() will be better, as it uses the native http\_build\_query().

However, I would still like to store the GET parameters in an internal array of the client, and only when the request is sent "attach" them to the URI object - and this is important because I want people to be able to set parameters before they set the URI for example, or even set several parameters, then set a URI with it's own parameters, and when the request is sent, not to lose any of them.

Does this makes sense to you? If so, I'll fix up my \_prepare\_headers() method to use $this->uri->setQuery().

Shahar.

I think that's a good idea, Shahar.

By the way, I've reconsidered the setQuery() function a little. It should probably look more like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Zend_Uri_Http
    
        public function setQuery($query)
        {
            $this->_query = $this->_parseQuery($query);
        }
    
        protected function _parseQuery($query)
        {
            if (empty($query)) {
                return "";
            }
    
            $queryArray = array();
            if (is_array($query)) {
                $queryArray = $query;
            } else if (is_string($query)) {
                parse_str($query, $queryArray);
            }
            if (count($queryArray) < 1) {
                throw new Zend_Uri_Exception('No query parameters found');
            }
            $query = http_build_query($queryArray, '', '&');
            if (!$this->validateQuery($query)) {
                throw new Zend_Uri_Exception('Invalid query string');
            }
            return $query;
        }

I commited Zend\_Uri and Zend\_Uri\_Http revision 1064 which includes your suggestions, although I modified your code a bit.

Please take a look at it and let me know what you think (if you want to).

Do not mark this bug as fixed - I'll later proceed to change Zend\_Http\_Client as well.

Thanks for making the update. I like the fact that you return the old query in setQuery now.

As far as the changes in \_parseQuery, I debated whether or not to include the parse\_str part or not. The main purpose there was an additional check for string validity. Which, of course, does not belong in \_parseQuery, but validateQuery.

However, the regular expression in that method (validateQuery) doesn't seem to adequately cover query string validity. Would something involving parse\_str (perhaps comparing the array it returns to an array generated from manually parsing) be good to add there?

Brain lapse. Ignore the parenthetical aside in the last sentence. :-)

I think the recent changes to Zend\_Http\_Client and Zend\_Uri\_Http solve all issues described here. I don't think using parse\_str is right because just for validating the string, it's a bit overkill (building up an array and all). The query string can be validated easily with a regexp, as long as you follow the RFC.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
