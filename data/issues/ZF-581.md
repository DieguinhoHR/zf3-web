### Description

When using Zend\_Http\_Cookie::fromString() with a refUrl such as '<http://localhost/Framework/>' (where there is only a directory name, and no file name), the cookie path will be wrong ('/' in this case). This is due to wrong value returned by dirname in Zend/Http/Cookie.php line 281
