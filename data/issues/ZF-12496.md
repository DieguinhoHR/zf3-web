ZF-12496: Zend\_Validate\_Identical don't launches if form element value is empty

### Description

Assume we have two form fields: password and password\_repeat. Both of it is not required. The last one has attached Zend\_Validate\_Identical validator (token parameter points to password form field). In case when values (password:'12345',password\_repeat:'1') passed - anything works great. But if to pass (password:'12345',password\_repeat:'') form has success validation. It looks like since password\_repeat form element has no any data submitted no any validation launches at all. I am not sure if it is exactly Zend\_Validation\_Identical class bug against Zend\_Form::isValid mechanism. Anyway, '' is not identical to '12345', thus form shouldn't be validated successfully.

If the field is not required, and no value is provided, validators are not checked. As such, you need to either (a) mark it as required, or (b) create a custom validator that checks if the "password" field is non-empty and only then runs the Identical validator.

Yes, thank you. There are also another ways to solve the trouble.

I guess this is a question of logic not a bug exactly. In described case non-required form field with no value provided needed validator to be launched though.
