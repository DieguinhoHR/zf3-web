### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement incorrectly assumes all HTML attributes have values but this is not so (eg. readonly, disabled etc.).

Here's my patch for it:

I just discovered the actual terminology I was groping for is "boolean attributes" and in my ignorance missed it in the docs first time round. I thought only the minimised form existed. Here is the HTML reference I should have seen (apols):

[http://w3.org/TR/html401/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.3.4.2)

and here for XHTML:

[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C\_10](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_10)

Going by the user agent comments, there still might be a case for the patch but I sense not, and I need to get used to writing checked="checked" etc.

Mark -- you may want to check out recent SVN; the Checkbox element now operates basically as a boolean, and you do not need to specify the 'checked' attribute with it (it determines it based on the value). Let me know if this resolves the issue for you.

Thanks Matthew. Yes that insulates me from the issue altogether on checkboxes.

I get the impression that ZF general policy is to render the full form boolean attribute so perhaps for a better example where I cannot rely on ZF code deciding, If I want say, a readonly attribute, I should actually set an element's attribute as readonly=readonly for best practice and not worry about w3.org's browser support for full form booleans as it probably not even a concern any more?

I think this is not really an issue going by the comments. So would like to close it.
