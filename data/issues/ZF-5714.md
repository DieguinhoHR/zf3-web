### Description

I created a tab container as such for a multi page form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class forms_JudgmentWrapper extends ZendX_JQuery_Form   {
    
        public function init() {
    
            $this->setAction('/');
            $this->setAttrib('id', 'JudgmentWrapper');
            $this->setAttrib('class', 'flora');     
            $this->clearDecorators();
            $this->setDecorators(array(
                'FormElements',
                array('TabContainer', array(
                    'id' => 'tabContainer',
                    'style' => 'width: 800px;',
                )),
                'Form',
            ));
    
        }
    }


The resulting HTML source is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


    
    

`Notice the invalid attribute in the div:    action="/"`

    

    If i remove the 
            $this->setAction('/');
    this is the result:

    


    <pre class="highlight">


    
    

`which is correct for the div, does not contain extra invalid attribute.`

    

`It would be nice to set the action of the form like done above, and per the documentation without it injecting it into the div tag.`
