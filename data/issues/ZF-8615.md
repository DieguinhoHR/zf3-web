ZF-8615: Twitter geo information not parsed
-------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-22T11:36:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:38:15.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The geotagging information isn't parsed properly from a tweet with geo information attached. There is a geo array item returned in the result object but it is empty.

I would guess this is due to the geo information belonging to a different namespace, below is a snippet:

www.georss.org/georss"> 54.39790844 -1.85352928

After looking at this further, it seems this issue may actually be a problem with Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Response and SimpleXML needing namespaces to be registered before xpath will read them.

The following code will at least get the coordinates out:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    // Get User Timeline
    $twitter = new Zend_Service_Twitter('username','password');
    $response = $twitter->status->userTimeline();
    
    // Register Namespaces
    $simpleXml = $response->getIterator();
    $namespaces = $simpleXml->getNamespaces(true);
    foreach ($namespaces as $prefix => $ns) {
        $simpleXml->registerXPathNamespace($prefix, $ns);
    }
    
    // Print list of geo tags if they exist
    print_r($simpleXml->xpath('//georss:point'));
    


I haven't got as far as trying to patch Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Response to return namespaced elements, but the above code should at least help with demonstrating the problem and / or help someone with implementing a fix.

^ and when I say Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Response I really mean Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result
