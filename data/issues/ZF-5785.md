### Description

Zend\_Paginator should offer setDefaultItemCountPerPage().

Scenario: Someone is using Zend\_Paginator in his project and suddenly realizes that he don't want default 10 items per page, but he didn't use $paginator->setDefaultItemCountPerPage(10) - so he can't use replace.

How it should work: Zend\_Paginator::setDefaultItemCountPerPage(int $count); //would change from 10 to $count

Restoration of assigning was my mistake I thought I was another problem. Excuse me.
