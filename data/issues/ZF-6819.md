### Description

I wanted to have an upload field, which would not overwrite any existing file (if I uploaded two foobar.jpg files, the second one would fail with an error message).

In order to do that, I had following code in 1.7.\*:

 
        $element->setLabel('Upload a file')
                ->addFilter('Rename',
                            array('overwrite' => false));


Everything worked fine. In 1.8.1, there is a change in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http at the line 160 and following:

 
                $filename = $directory . $content['name'];
                $rename   = $this->getFilter('Rename');
                if ($rename !== null) {
                    $filename = $rename->getNewName($content['tmp_name']);
                    $key      = array_search(get_class($rename), $this->_files[$file]['filters']);
                    unset($this->_files[$file]['filters'][$key]);
                }


That leads to Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename::getNewName(), which returns $content['tmp\_name'] with no change. After that, back in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http, a move\_uploaded\_file is being called, with the same file name in both attributes, leading to a PHP error and upload failure (uploaded file is not copied to the desired destination)

Warning: move\_uploaded\_file() [function.move-uploaded-file]: Unable to move 'D:\\Web\\Upload\\php1C3F.tmp' to 'D:\\Web\\Upload\\php1C3F.tmp' in D:\\Web\\Lib\\Zend\\File\\Transfer\\Adapter\\Http.php on line 169

Solution to this issue is either remove the rename filter, or add a "target" parameter - which works, but is not usable for my situation. I don't want to change any name, I just want to ensure that existing file won't be rewrited on the server.
