### Description

The current application resource for Jquery does not allow cdn\_ssl to be enabled. This is explicitly disabled by the array\_merge of the options with array('cdn\_ssl' => false)

Here's my sample portion of the ini file

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.Jquery.version = 1.4.2
    resources.Jquery.ui_enable = true
    resources.Jquery.ui_version = 1.8.4
    resources.Jquery.cdn_ssl = true
    resources.Jquery.stylesheet = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.4/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css"


But the configuration for 'cdn\_ssl' is ignored because it is merged with an array where it is set to false

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _parseOptions(array $options)
        {
            $options = array_merge($options, array('cdn_ssl' => false));


If there's a reason for it being done, I can't find any documentation for it.

The fix would be just to remove the array\_merge. The workaround is to set ``` but this defeats the purpose of having that configurability in the resource. I need cdn\_ssl to prevent mixed-mode when other resources are made available over SSL.
