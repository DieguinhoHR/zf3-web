ZF-11307: Reset sequence number when truncating table during PHPUnit test -> only for PostgreSQL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

During a Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_DatabaseTestCase setup phase the tables from getDataSet() will be truncated. If PostgreSQL is the backend, the truncate operation is done by the following command:

'TRUNCATE '.$tableName.' CASCADE' (line 109, Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Db\_Operation\_Truncate)

PostgreSQL has the possibility to reset the sequence numbers during truncate. This is described in [http://postgresql.org/docs/8.4/â€¦](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/sql-truncate.html) .

IMHO it makes sense to extend the truncate command for PostgreSQL like this.

$db->query('TRUNCATE '.$tableName.' RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE');

This command resets the sequence number of the primary key.
