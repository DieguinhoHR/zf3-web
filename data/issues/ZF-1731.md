### Description

Hello

When I try to get error code of Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo\_Exception it returns nothing. Is this desired behavior? I think it's a bug.

This is just small patch I made to fix this bug until something better is not created. It should be applied to Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php file.

Small patch I have attached here is not good because Exception constructor takes long type for code and SQLSTATE can contain uppercase letters. I think that Zend\_Db\_Exception should be changed to address this issue.

[^ZF-1731\_patch.patch] . New patch I have created. It is changing Zend\_Db\_Exception and Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo. I hope that this patch is properly created as explained in Submitting a bug fix. I do not know will it be better to change Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception. I thought that other Db exceptions could benefit from this patch so I changed Zend\_Db\_Exception instead.

It is not necessary to change Zend\_Db\_Exception itself because standard Exception class from PHP already includes code property.

The problem of having an error-code is not a Zend\_Db only problem. It is related to all ZF-classes. We have already a proposal which is finished for review [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22134)

This will integrate error-codes consistently for ALL classes. I will therefor close this issue. To help integration vote for the proposal.

I think it will be integrated shortly after 1.5 is released.

Duplicate for an already available proposal... closing this issue in benefit of the proposal.

ZF-1768 was duplicate of this bug. As I understand this issue user needs to get SQLSTATE (SQL standard error codes). If I understanded [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22134) proposal it will not give possibility to specify SQL errors.

So probably we should open new feature request to add something like getSQLErrorCode member function to Zend\_Db\_Exception.

Yes, I think this would be better. There is also a problem which prevent this issue to be added: PDO errorcodes are not compatible with PHP exception codes.

So I think it would be better to have sqlError added as own property and method to Db exceptions. Seems better than use the standard errorcode, and in my opinion more secure ;-)
