### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->select()->from('A')->joinUsing('B', 'colname')


Should produce SQL syntax with the USING clause:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM A JOIN B USING (colname)


But it currently tries to guess at the tables being joined, and output a traditional equi-join:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON A.colname = B.colname

This actually results in semantic problems in some queries, because Zend\_Db\_Select always assumes that a "Using" join is joining to the first table referenced in the query. This is not how the USING clause works in SQL.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->select()->from('A')->joinUsing('B', 'colname1')->joinUsing('C', 'colname2')


Should produce SQL syntax:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM A JOIN B USING (colname1) JOIN C USING (colname2)


This should give the same results as this query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON B.colname1 = A.colname1 JOIN C ON C.colname2 = B.colname2


But in Zend\_Db\_Select, it produces the following SQL:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON B.colname1 = A.colname1 JOIN C ON C.colname2 = A.colname2


Of course if table A has no colname2, this query returns an error.

If both A and B have a column named colname2, a query with USING (column2) is ambiguous, and should return an error. The SQL produced by Zend\_Db\_Select is not ambiguous, but it assumes that C is joined to A. This is in improper assumption.

Schema for above example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE A ( colname1 INT);
    CREATE TABLE B ( colname1 INT, colname2 INT);
    CREATE TABLE C ( coname2 INT);


SQL's USING clause actually knows which columns exist in which tables, and it decides which table you're trying to join based on which table has a column of the same name. So it knows that you intend to join C.colname2 = B.colname2 because it knows B has a column colname2.

When multiple tables in the query contain a column of the same name, this is ambiguous and the semantics for USING can't guess what you intended. So it throws an error, which is the right thing to do.

Updating project management info: Minor, Should Have in Next Mini Release, assumed 2h of work.

I think that joinUsing should change to support USING like it should and at the same time it should support a joinOn. I spoke with Ralph about this issue and I came with a suggested implementation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function joinOn($table, $onCondition) {
            if (strpos($onCondition, ' ') === false) {
                $onCondition = $this->_name . '.' . $this->_primary . ' = ' . $table . '.' . $onCondition;
            }
    
            $this->... = 'JOIN ' . $table . ' ON (' . $onCondition . ')';
        }


It's a pseudo-code... I'm not too focused on Zend Framework internals. So it's just an idea. Just a quick explanation:

The condition is there to support custom queries too. Examples:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $q->joinOn('B', 'column'); // JOIN B ON (A.column = B.column)
    
    $q->joinOn('B', 'A.foo = B.column2'); // JOIN B ON (A.foo = B.column2)

After speaking with [~ralph] on the issue, it was decided to close this as "Won't Fix" for these two reasons:

- SQL Server and Sybase do not support USING clause
- JOIN USING and JOIN ON differ in the way they return columns. ie: JOIN ON would have t1.col and t2.col in the result set, but JOIN USING would have only col, so references to t1.col or t2.col in the WHERE clause would fail.
