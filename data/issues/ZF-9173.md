### Description

For code like this (called from within class extending Zend\_Form):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $thumbnail = $this->createElement('file', 'thumbnail')
        // ensure only 1 file
        ->addValidator('Count', false, 1)
        ->addValidator('Size', false, $maxFilesize)
        ->addValidator('IsImage', false)
        ->addFilter('Rename', array(
            'target' => realpath($newName), 
            'overwrite' => false));


I'm getting form error after calling isValid method, that more than one file was passed (even if it's for sure only one file), but still isValid returns true. I'm not sure if it is a bug, or correct behaviour.

Would you please change Component to Zend\_File and Zend\_Validate, thanks. Not an issue for Zend\_Form.

 <?php echo $form->render(new Zend\_View());?>
