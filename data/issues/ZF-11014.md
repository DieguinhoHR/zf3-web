### Description

The statusFriendsTimeline does not include options as specified by Twitter's API: [http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/â€¦](http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/statuses/friends_timeline)

Missing are max\_id, trim\_user, include\_rts, and include\_entities.

These should be able to be passed in the params array when calling the method.
