ZF-1206: Zend\_Filter\_RealPath to support non-existing paths
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-04-05T08:11:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-25T13:19:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

I would like to suggest to add an enhancement to the current Zend\_Filter\_RealPath filter. PHP's function realpath will give you the absolute path from the provided path, however this does not work when a path does not exist. Realpath would then return false.

Allowing calculation of realpath() results when the input path does not exist, would be a good enhancement for the current implementation.

However, the developer should be able to turn this feature on/off, as I can imagine the need of having false returned when the path does not exist.

We have not agreed yet how to turn the feature on/off. I personally would prefer havinig a public property which could be set to true (default) or false.

Another idea is to have a public method allowVirtualPath(true)...

Andries: Please give code or a description on how this should be done. Actually I see problems if the complete path does not exist.

When there is no response I will close this issue as won't fix as there are wether votes nor watchers on it.
