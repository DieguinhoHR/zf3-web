### Description

"Example 15.67. Example of the limit() method" wants to reproduce the following query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    with the following code


$select = $db->select() ->from(array('p' => 'products'), array('product\_id', 'product\_name')) ->limit(10, 20);

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    In the API reference, you find the following


So to reproduce the query, you need to swap the numbers 10 and 20.

 
    <pre class="highlight">$select = $db->select()
                 ->from(array('p' => 'products'),
                        array('product_id', 'product_name'))
                 ->limit(20, 10);

We (my company) Also stumbled on this problem, unfortunatly we found this problem while limit is implemented on allot of applications.

I guess, it's a documentation bug BUT none the less should be looked at since everybody is relying on the docs!
