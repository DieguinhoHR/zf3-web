### Description

@version $Id: Inflector.php 7078 2007-12-11 14:29:33Z matthew $

Parameters $throwTargetExceptionsOn and $targetReplacementIdentifer in Zend\_Filter\_Inflector \_\_construct method are ignored if boolean false.

Actual code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if ($throwTargetExceptionsOn != null) {
            $this->setThrowTargetExceptionsOn($throwTargetExceptionsOn);
        }
    
        if ($targetReplacementIdentifer != null) {
            $this->setTargetReplacementIdentifier($targetReplacementIdentifer);
        }


Proposed fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if ($throwTargetExceptionsOn !== null) {
            $this->setThrowTargetExceptionsOn($throwTargetExceptionsOn);
        }
    
        if ($targetReplacementIdentifer !== null) {
            $this->setTargetReplacementIdentifier($targetReplacementIdentifer);
        }

Fixed in r8226.

The targetReplacementIdentifier actually should be checking that the string is not != ''. The exception flag was fixed as well.
