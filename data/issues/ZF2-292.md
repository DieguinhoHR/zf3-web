ZF2-292: Type hinting is ignored if a single parameter is defined for a method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If I have a class:

class MyClass{ //@param InjectClass $injectClass A class instance to be injected //@param string $className A string of FQCN \_constructor(InjectClass $injectClass, $className){ } }

I want to use DI to configure this class. Because I want to inject a class name as a string, I need a DI definition. I think this should be enough:

'definition' => array( 'class' => array( 'MyClass' => array( 'methods' => array( '\_\_construct' => array( 'className' => array('type' => false ,'required' => true), ) ) ) ) )

However, if use the above definition, the type hinting for $injectClass is ignored, and a string is injected. The issue can be overcome with:

'definition' => array( 'class' => array( 'MyClass' => array( 'methods' => array( '\_\_construct' => array( 'injectClass' => array('InjectClass' => false ,'required' => true), 'className' => array('type' => false ,'required' => true), ) ) ) ) )
