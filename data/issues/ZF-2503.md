### Description

Within the conditional statements between the parentheses, operators must be separated by spaces for readability. Inner parentheses are encouraged to improve logical grouping of larger conditionals.

Cache\\Backend\\File.php, line 662:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    for ($i=0 ; $i<$this->_options['hashed_directory_level'] ; $i++) {


Add space between the less-than operand.
