ZF-2775: Jira BUG
-----------------

 Issue Type: Task Created: 2008-03-01T10:10:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-05-24T01:26:24.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Under Jira when searching bugs under Internet Explorer 7 the "find issues" windows is corrupted. In the above line the "view" button is displayed over almost the complete width of the page and hides the things behind it.

Under Firefox there are no display problems.

I expect that this is a CSS bug within the attached layout and should be fixed simply.

This bug has been solved with the confluence update some days ago.
