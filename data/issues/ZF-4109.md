ZF-4109: Make Zend\_Form\_Element's 'Description' decorator a default
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

From the documentation:

"By default, if no description is present, no output is generated. If the description is present, then it is wrapped in an HTML p tag by default, though you may specify a tag by passing a tag option when creating the decorator, or calling setTag()."

Just simply needs to be added to the default decorators :)
