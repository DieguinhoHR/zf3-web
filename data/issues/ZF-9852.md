### Description

This Problem seem to be there for more than one Year an i spent the last 2 days on find a solution on this issue so i decided to file this as a Bug. This is the original link to the post: [http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/â€¦](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/unable-to-disable-Dojo-td661750.html)

Here the issue:

1. I've put in my bootstrap file those two lines (set up Dojo environment but disable it by default):

 
        Zend_Dojo::enableView($view);
        $view->addHelperPath('Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/', 'Zend_Dojo_View_Helper');
        $view->dojo()->disable();
2. Then, in my authentication controller:

 
        class AuthController extends Zend_Controller_Action
        {
            function loginAction()
            {
                $form = new Form_Login();
                // ...
                $this->view->dojo()->disable(); // just to be sure
                $this->view->title = "Authentication";
                $this->view->form = $form;
            }
        }
3. My form extends Zend\_Form (NOT Zend\_Dojo\_Form). Furthermore, I only use plain elements that are not Dijits : Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text, Zend\_Form\_Element\_Password et Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit.
4. My view script is very short:

 
        <?php $this->headLink()->appendStylesheet($this->staticUrl('style/form.css')); ?>
        <h1><?php echo $this->escape($this->title); ?></h1>
        <?php echo $this->form; ?>
5. And this view script is invoked by the layout where one can find:

 
        <?php
        if ($this->dojo()->isEnabled()) {
            $this->dojo()->addStyleSheetModule('dijit.themes.tundra');
            echo $this->dojo();
        }
        ?>

But, in the generated HTML page, I find in the HEAD tag:

and here the possible solution:

There is a standard view helper, Form, and one of the same name in the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper tree. Because your view object has been initialized with the Dojo view helper path, it's finding the Dojo Form view helper and using that over the standard one.
