### Description

I must admit I am not wholly familiar with either Zend\_Db or Zend\_OpenId, but the code examples in Example 38.7. Database Storage worry me because they just seem to trust the incoming data so much.

e.g
---

public function delAssociation($url) { $table = $this->\_association\_table; $this->\_db->query("delete from $table where url = '$url'"); return true; }

- - - - - -

I think it would be wise to mention somewhere in the docs how we know that $url is not going to carry an SQL injection attack so that paranoid folk like me don't get anxious when reading it.

All documentation examined for bad security and update; fixes committed to trunk and 1.9 release branch.
