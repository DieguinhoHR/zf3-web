ZF-6479: Review all component dependencies, and remove not needed require\_onces

### Description

ZendFramework is getting bigger and bigger.

Even if we, ZF developpers, master our object dependencies, I noticed that some components do require\_once other classes that they won't use in any future way.

I suggest that any patch that correct such a behavior (i.e : suppress a require\_once) should reference that bug number in its commit text.

Please, do not close that bug report as it will always be up to date (we can assume that we will always have to track not needed dependencies)

I _am_ going to close this bug report, as it is too broad and not detailed enough.

The current plan is to gradually remove _all_ require\_once statements in favor of autoloading. However, this must be done over a period of releases, and likely not completely until 2.0. It will be far easier to simply remove all require\_once statements than to comb through the code and make unconditional requires conditional. Additionally, there are many performance benefits to doing so.

Ok, thanks for the details :)
