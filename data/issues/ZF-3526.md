ZF-3526: HtmlTag Decorator with empty tag name
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-06-27T05:28:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-21T09:49:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When configuring an element with the config like the following (leaving HtmlTag.options.tag empty):

elements.flightsearchhourstart.type = "hidden" elements.flightsearchhourstart.name = "hourStart" elements.flightsearchhourstart.options.decorators.helper = "ViewHelper" elements.flightsearchhourstart.options.decorators.HtmlTag.decorator = "HtmlTag" elements.flightsearchhourstart.options.decorators.HtmlTag.options.tag = ""

the hidden field will be sourrunded by empty openening and closing tags:

<></>

I fixed it with the following code within the HtmlTag-Decorator

 
    protected function _getOpenTag($tag, array $attribs = null)
    {
        $html='';
        if($tag!=''){
            $html = '<' . $tag;
            if (null !== $attribs) {
                $html .= $this->_htmlAttribs($attribs);
            }
            $html .= '>';
        }
        return $html;
    }


...............

 
    protected function _getCloseTag($tag)
    {
        if($tag!=''){
            return '</' . $tag . '>';
        }
        return '';
    }

I do not understand why you are adding the HtmlTag Decorator at all if you do not want it to be rendered.

Even i do not know what the state was in 1.5.2, in current trunk, setting the ViewHelper Decorator in config disables loading default Decorators, so this issue is now a non issue for me, and i am closing it now.
