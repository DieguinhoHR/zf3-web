ZF-1984: Zend\_Db\_Statement->\_stripQuoted() does not escape strings in regular expressions

### Description

When using reserved characters like [ and ], the regular expressions in the protected function Zend\_Db\_Statement->\_stripQuoted() throw an exception/error. This is because the strings should be quoted like that:

$q = preg\_quote($q); $qe = preg\_quote($qe); $d = preg\_quote($d); $de = preg\_quote($de);

I noticed this problem while using MS-SQL Server (odbtp). Of course, you can set QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER to ON and use double quotes instead of brackets (as described in related tickets):

<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa224033>(SQL.80).aspx

This however doesn't change the fact, that chars inserted into a regular expression should be escaped. Delimiters in brackets can always be used, regardless of the setting of QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER.

Just an idea, but isn't there an easier way of getting the escape characters from the database adapter? Functions like getIdentifierQuoteStartChar(), getIdentifierQuoteEndChar(), getQuoteStartChar() and getQuoteEndChar()? I would even recommend using public class constants for this purpose.

Assigning to [~bkarwin] to initiate issue review. Is this issue really a blocker?

Don't use brackets as identifier delimiters. This is not standard SQL, it's bogus Microsoft syntax. The Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql class always executes "SET QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER ON" after connecting, to encourage usage of standard SQL syntax.

I don't think we should add methods to the Db Adapter interface to support non-standard syntax used by a single vendor. The better solution is to use the standard SQL identifier delimiter, which is the double-quote (") and is the same for begin and end of a delimited identifier.
