### Description

Add a new view helper for Zend\_Currency. (Zend\_View\_Helper\_Currency)

It should be able to format currencies and create a output with only a simple call within the view.

Agreed. This really is critical to the use of Zend\_Currency without having to do this in advance in the controller. Much cleaner to build a view helper and use it in the view to format currencies.

Closing as "needs proposal".

The related proposal has already been accepted for development within the incubator.
