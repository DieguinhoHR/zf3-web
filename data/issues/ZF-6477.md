### Description

When you try to put an object into a bucket located in EU, you get an error from amazon, that this bucket must be accessed using the specific endpoint (bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com). I have changed the function \_makeRequest as follows. It seems to work so far with these changes. Haven't tested intensively.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Make a request to Amazon S3
         *
         * TODO: support bucket.s3.amazon.com style
         *
         * @param  string $method
         * @param  string $path
         * @param  array  $params
         * @param  array  $headers
         * @param  string $data
         * @return Zend_Http_Response
         */
        public function _makeRequest($method, $path='', $params=null, $headers=array(), $data=null)
        {
            $retry_count = 0;
    
            if (!is_array($headers)) {
                $headers = array($headers);
            }
    
            $headers['Date'] = gmdate(DATE_RFC1123, time());
    
            $parts = explode('/', $path);
            self::addSignature($method, $path, $headers);
    
            $client = self::getHttpClient();
    
            $client->resetParameters();
            // Work around buglet in HTTP client - it doesn't clean headers
            // Remove when ZHC is fixed
            $client->setHeaders(array('Content-MD5' => null, 'Expect' => null, 'Range' => null));
            
            $endpoint = self::S3_ENDPOINT;
            if (count($parts) > 1){
                $endpoint = str_replace('http://', 'http://' . $parts[0] . '.', $endpoint);
                array_shift($parts);
                $client->setUri($endpoint.'/'.implode('/', $parts));
            } else {
                $client->setUri(self::S3_ENDPOINT.'/'.$path);
            }
            $client->setHeaders($headers);
    
            if (is_array($params)) {
                foreach ($params as $name=>$value) {
                    $client->setParameterGet($name, $value);
                }
             }
    
             if (($method == 'PUT') && ($data !== null)) {
                 if (!isset($headers['Content-type'])) {
                     $headers['Content-type'] = self::getMimeType($path);
                 }

                $response_code = $response->getStatus();
    
                // Some 5xx errors are expected, so retry automatically
                if ($response_code >= 500 && $response_code < 600 && $retry_count <= 5) {
                    $retry = true;
                    $retry_count++;
                    sleep($retry_count / 4 * $retry_count);
                }
                else if ($response_code == 307) {
                    // Need to redirect, new S3 endpoint given

Could your attach a patch file so i apply this and test it?

Thanks,

Here is a patchfile with the changes.

IMHO it would be a good idea to handle Amazon S3 API permanent redirects, which seem to use the HTTP status 301 and do not set a location header (and are therefore not handled by Zend\_HTTP\_Client).

Kristof,

I didn't write this component to i'm not too entierly sure what you are talking about. Can you please provide the docs page that explains that or submit a patch?

Hi Jon

You can find more information about it at [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/…](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?Redirects.html), under "Permanent Request Redirection". After thinking a bit more about this, it might be better to use domain-style requests after all, as Ivo suggests. That works in all cases (EU and US-located buckets).

This has been resolved and checked-in to svn.

Hello,

are you shure that is suitable for all operations that can be done? When I try to DELETE an object from a bucket (in the EU) then I get an positive response from S3. But my object is still there. I guess the problem is, that Amazon's API also returns this positive response when you try to delete an object that does not even exist. I did not test for other operations yet.
