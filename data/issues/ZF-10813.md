ZF-10813: Setting the fetch mode during initialization (or in the config)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-12-12T07:23:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:33.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

In Zend\\Db\\Db the constant FETCH\_MODE somehow got lost although it is present in the current 1.x release. The same is with the setting of the $\_fetchMode property in the constructor of Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter.

I wasn't sure if I should reopen this ticket: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6620> as it is related to the 1.x branch and this only affects 2.0.

I will make the push to the git so how another issues fixed in version greater than 1.10.x.

Greetings Ramon
