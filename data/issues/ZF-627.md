### Description

System: Linux 2.6.18, PHP 5.2.0, Postgresql 8.1.5

Here is what I ran across, and it may very well be user error and not a bug at all.

I was going through this tutorial (<http://www.akrabat.com/zend-framework-tutorial/>) to get my feet wet with the Zend Framework. I tried to implement this class:

{quote} class Album extends Zend\_Db\_Table {

} {quote}

My table could not be found because the table was within a Postgresql schema named "cms" ([http://postgresql.org/docs/8.1/â€¦](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/ddl-schemas.html)). I "know" this because if I changed the database to not use a schema, the above code works. FYI, in Postgresql the correct way to reference the table "album" within the schema "cms", is "cms.album".

I tried changing the code to:

{quote} class Album extends Zend\_Db\_Table { protected $\_name = 'cms.album'; } {quote}

but it failed, but with a different error.

This is as far as I was able to dig.

- If I use the fully qualified table name (ie "cms.album") the \_setup() function will fail in /Zend/Db/Table.php because $this->\_cols is empty
- If I use just the name of he table (ie "album") query() function fails in /Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php because the table cannot be found

So, should Zend\_Db be able to use schema qualified tables? Is this a PDO problem?

Assigning to Bill Karwin. Scheduling to be resolved in ZF 0.8.0.

Removing the word "PostgreSQL" from the summary. This may also apply to MySQL and other RDBMS back-ends that support the ``` syntax.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

This should be fixed as of revision 3729.  
 "schema.table" is quoted as "schema"."table" by virtue of a change to the logic in quoteIdentifier().
