### Description

Example 7.6 in the manual shows how the redirector helper can be used to set default options in a controller's init() method, and later just trigger the redirectAndExit().

It would be nice to have the possibility to clear out previously set options (at least the location/URL the helper should redirect to), so that you can have the helper _not_ redirect. Currently, if you set a goto in the init method, but never calls redirectAndExit(), the redirect will occur when the response headers are sent, since the goto is already added to the response's Location header.

What I'm suggesting is to do a lazy redirect. In calls to \_redirect(), the location is stored in a class variable instead of being set in the response right away. Further, the helper should use its preDispatch() hook or \_\_destruct() to put the location in the response headers, if a location is set. With this, there should be a method in the helper for clearing out the stored location, e.g. clearGoto(), that would make the helper not redirect when the response is sent.

This should not break any backwards compatbility.
