The Row documentation has been rewritten, and the reported mistake is no longer present.

The mistaken documentation is still present in translation directories for NL, PT-BR, and ZH. When the translators sync the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.xml, the mistake will be corrected.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
