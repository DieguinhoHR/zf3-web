### Description

$Admin is an Extension of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract.

$select = $Admin->select()->setIntegrityCheck(false) ->from(array('u' => new User()), array()) ->joinLeft(array('a' => $Admin), 'u.id = a.userid AND a.parenttype = 1 AND a.parentid = '.$Admin->getAdapter()->quote($leagueid).' AND a.status = 10', array()) ->where('u.status = 10') ->where('u.id = '.Zend\_Auth::getInstance()->getIdentity()->id); echo $select;

returns SELECT `admin`.\* FROM `user` AS `u` LEFT JOIN `admin` AS `a` ON u.id = a.userid AND a.parenttype = 1 AND a.parentid = '1' AND a.status = 10 INNER JOIN `admin` WHERE (u.status = 10) AND (u.id = 1)

/edit

as i dont know how to add comments: my extension of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract has \_\_toString() { return $this->\_name}.

I changed it though to array('a' => 'admin') without any difference. and then, later on, i couldnt reproduce it. it was gone for no reason .... sorry.

You use $Admin twice in two different contexts. Please try to reproduce this (alleged) bug without using $Admin (twice).
