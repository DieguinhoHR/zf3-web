ZF-6738: Implement Countable interface
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-05-20T02:18:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:14.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

It would be nice to implement the Countable interface to the "Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Feed". The count function already exists, so simply adding "implements Countable" is sufficient.

This addition is very useful when using Zend\_Paginator with the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Iterator for traversing feeds.
