### Description

Please add to the \_decodeObject function

// create user defined class instances if \_\_className exists case Zend\_Json::TYPE\_USERDEFINED: if ($members['\_\_className'] && class\_exists($members['\_\_className'])) $result = new $members<a href="">'\_\_className'</a>; else $result = new StdClass(); break; // end edit

Functionality like this was actually removed from the original code submission. While convenient, it is a dangerous practice as it allows unfiltered input to be used to instantiate and populate a user-defined class.

You may either tell Zend\_Json\_Decoder to create a stdclass object (just a glorified associative array) or an associative array when decoding JSON objects by passing the $decodeType to Zend\_Json::decode() or Zend\_Json\_Decoder::\_\_construct().

Fix would introduce security issues.

Maybe the lib could support optional execution of this? This way it is up to the coder to decide when to trust incoming data. Otoh never doing it makes a bit pointless the addition of \_\_classname inthe first place when encoding objects...
