### Description

It is not possible to clear the protected \_messages array on a form element. It might also be desirable to have a setMessages() method.

I couldn't imagine any case where you need to delete the messages (which are provided by your validators). In case of setMessages you could use Zend\_Translate, then the validators return the translated messages and you don't need any further steps.

If you want to check if a value is valid, but don't want to pollute the element's messages, clearMessages and setMessages would both be handy. As it stands, you must clone the element to avoid polluting the messages.

i've added a "clearMessages" method to Zend\_Form/Zend\_Form\_Element and additionaly "addMessage" and "addMessages" to Zend\_Form\_Element (corresponding tests included)
