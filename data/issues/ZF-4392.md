### Description

Currently the \_htmlAttribs method can return uppercased attributes. This makes the output fail XHTML validation. All attribute keys should be lowercased.

Can you provide an example of how you are calling this? I am thinking that all that needs to be done is calling the strtolower on the $key variable.

Actually, this should not be honored.

If the user wants to use lowercase attributes, then simply make sure the keys are appropriately cast before you use the helper. However, there are some situations where case _does_ matter. Some JS toolkits differentiate based on case, and will not function correctly if cast to all lowercase. Regardless, _no_ browser today will balk at mixedCase attributes.
