ZF-12551: Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Files::storeObject sets Content-Type to 'application/json'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There is currently no way to set the Content-Type header when storing an object to cloudfiles. This means if you upload image to CDN it will have the wrong content type when you reference it by URL.

The attached patch adds a $content\_type parameter to storeObject(), giving the method the same signature as copyObject().

Oops, looks like I'm out of date. This is a dupe of ZF-12421
