### Description

With translated routes and locale based on BROWSER detection, when specific gettext translation is unavailable Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route throws warnings.

Notice: Undefined index: fr in .../Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 403 Warning: array\_search(): Wrong datatype for second argument in .../Zend/Controller/Router/Route.php on line 257

Zend\_translate started with options:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array('scan' => Zend_Translate::LOCALE_DIRECTORY, 'disableNotices' => true)

@Marek: Before line 257 var\_dump($translateMessages); and give us the result as attachment.

@Matthew: Sidenote: Retrieving ALL messages of this language (as done on line 209 of Router can be a performance headache because one language could hold more than 5000 translations. And loading 5000 translations just to match one single translation instead of using translate() or isTranslated() is no good way.

I would request to rework this.

It's NULL because... Let's say I have folder structure /application/translations/de|ro and some Controller Plugin which tries to discover language in routeStartup and if !Zend\_Locale::isLocale fallback to en\_US. All messages are written in english - $this->translate('message') same as @rule in Router\_Route. Now if You change browser's locale to 'en' You'll get this warning because translation /translations/en/something.mo does not exist. Default translation is used.

In answer to Your sidenote. Whole Zend\_Translate/Locale is terribly slow. Benchmark before (fastcgi, APC enabled): 29 req/s, after (with cache set both for Locale and Translate) 16 req/s. Almost 50% decrease.

I see another problem. Just updated PHP to 5.3 and now, when translation is not provided, routing doesn't work. I always get index/index. And that is why there shouldn't be warnings in production code ;)
