Assigning to Thomas. Thomas, do you believe this to be a critical issue that must be included with 1.0.2?

No, this issue is not critical.

If someone uses a language which is not included it will always fall back to the messageid/default language. So this issue is no blocker and not a must for 1.0.2.

Of course the behaviour is not ok and will be reviewed and fixed.

Pseudo Problem fixed with SVN 6604. Empty sources do now no longer show up as translateable.

Please try out the revision 6604 or higher and give us response.

Closing this issue as we get no return from the reporter and it's already fixed since 2 weeks.
