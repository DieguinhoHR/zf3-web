ZF-8180: Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType changes are not backward compatible
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-29T10:44:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-11-03T11:52:54.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

The behaviour of the validator when used throgh form .ini definition file is broken. In previous releases the default behaviour enforced header check when finfo and mime\_content\_type functions were not available. Now header check is performed only when explicitely set, which breaks the validation - NOT\_DETECTED exception is thrown.

I set component value and auto reassign.

@Huan: Why did you attach an issue to yourself when you are not the maintainer of this component nor have asked if you could attach it ?

It's not a good behaviour just to change the assignee only because you have the possibility to do so.

Note from the manual:

{quote}

MimeType validation
            <para>
                For security reasons we had to turn off the default fallback mechanism of the
                <classname>MimeType</classname>, <classname>ExcludeMimeType</classname>,
                <classname>IsCompressed</classname> and <classname>IsImage</classname> validators.
                This means, that if the <emphasis>fileInfo</emphasis> or
                <emphasis>magicMime</emphasis> extensions can not be found, the validation will
                always fail.
            </para>
    
            <para>
                If you are in need of validation by using the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> fields which
                are provided by the user then you can turn on this feature by using the
                <methodname>enableHeaderCheck()</methodname> method.
            </para>
    
            <note>
                <title>Security hint</title>
    
                <para>
                    You should note that relying on the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> fields, which are
                    provided by your user, is a security risk. They can easily be changed and could
                    allow your user to provide a malcious file.
                </para>
            </note>
    
            <example id="zend.file.transfer.migration.example">
                <title>Allow the usage of the HTTP fields</title>
    
                <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[


// at initiation $valid = new Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http(array('headerCheck' => true);

// or afterwards $valid->enableHeaderCheck(); ]]>

Solution was Security related. Please read the migration notes in the manual.

Closing as not an issue

Hi Thomas, I'm sorry about that. I don't know it. I only want to fix something if I can. I'm a newcomer. I won't repeat it. I didn't change the assignee. I only assigned the issue to myself.

Thanks your understanding.

By assigning the issue to yourself you changed the assignee to your person.

General: Look if you can fix a issue by reproducing it. Ask the maintainer if you can take it over, or simply attach a patch to the issue. You don't need to change the assignment for this.

When you are working on an issue and it is assigned to you mark it as "in progress".

Add a comment describing what you are doing, also when you assigned a issue to yourself.

@Thomas:

The migration note in the manual refers to version 1.10, not 1.9.x - in which the mechanism was changed.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2009-11-03T11:52:53.000+0000

I copied from the file "migration-19.xml" and the title is:

{quote}When upgrading from a previous release to Zend Framework 1.9 or higher you should note the following migration notes{quote}

So I expect that it is meant for ZF 1.9 and above. Still I note that the rendered manual does not have this section.

I expect that this is a build problem. As the original file is ok, the error should be gone with the next release/build.

Therefor not reopening the issue as it's already fixed and marked with next minor release.
