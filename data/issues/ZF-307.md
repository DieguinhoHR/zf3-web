### Description

Hello

I'm writing third application in ZF and there is one confusing thing:

When I want to write sth into row from db once i have to use \_cols keys, and other time \_cols values

explain: in class Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row we have method setFromArray and input array must has keys equal to \_cols keys in insert we also should use \_cols keys

but in other methods like \_\_get \_\_set \_\_update etc we access by \_cols values

so maybe it should be one standard ?? It's very difficult to guess what use where....

I propose to everywhere use \_cols values

and my solution, which I use in insert,update etc

foreach ($this->\_cols as $k=>$v) { if (in\_array($v,$input\_array)) $data[$k] = $input\_array[$v]; }

Superbiji writes: {quote}add Zend\_DB\_Row::fromArray()

currently there is only Zend\_DB\_Row::setfromArray() {quote}

Resolved in revision 3725.

The $\_cols array is just the keys from describeTable(), there is no longer any distinction between the "native" column name and the inflected column name.
