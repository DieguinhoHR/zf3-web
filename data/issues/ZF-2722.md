### Description

I´ve found some misnamed functions which violates our coding standards.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field: - Binary() - Keyword() - Text() - UnIndexed() - UnStored()

{quote}_Functions and Methods_ [...] _Function names must always start with a lowercase letter. When a function name consists of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be capitalized. This is commonly called the "camelCaps" method._ [...]{quote} [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/ZF+Coding+Standards+%28RC%29#ZFCodingStandards%28RC%29-FunctionsandMethods)
