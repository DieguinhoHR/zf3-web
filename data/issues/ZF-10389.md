### Description

I have seen a couple threads in the mailing list archives describing this issue, but they haven't received much feedback:

[http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Avoid-ID-duplication-on-multiple-subforms-td670099.html)

[http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Zend-Form-label-decorator-duplicated-id-td663687.html)

I think there is a pretty simple fix to this, if someone can verify it.

1) In Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label, lines 316-323:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (null !== $tag) {
        require_once 'Zend/Form/Decorator/HtmlTag.php';
        $decorator = new Zend_Form_Decorator_HtmlTag();
        $decorator->setOptions(array('tag' => $tag,
    -                                'id'  => $this->getElement()->getName() . '-label'));
    +                                'id'  => $this->getElement()->getFullyQualifiedName() . '-label'));
    
        $label = $decorator->render($label);
    }


2) In Zend\_Form\_Element, lines 317-324:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (empty($decorators)) {
        $this->addDecorator('ViewHelper')
            ->addDecorator('Errors')
            ->addDecorator('Description', array('tag' => 'p', 'class' => 'description'))
            ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dd',
    -                                       'id'  => $this->getName() . '-element'))
    +                                       'id'  => $this->getFullyQualifiedName() . '-element'))
            ->addDecorator('Label', array('tag' => 'dt'));
    }


In both cases, it involves substituting getFullyQualifiedName() for getName().

Ok, after trying a couple things, that idea isn't quite right. The fully qualified name likely has characters that are not valid for an id value. In the decorator, that seems to be solvable by using getId() instead of getFullyQualifiedName().

The form element is a little more involved. At the time the code I posted executes, getId() does not yet address the belongsTo path. I guess the change I suggested could be pushed off to render($view), where getId() returns the correct value. I don't know what side effects that might introduce, though.
