ZF-5094: Zend\_Amf serialization of associative arrays with Amf0 does not retains the keys

### Description

When serializing an associative array the keys are not preserved correctly.

The class handling the serialization to Amf0 format is Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_Amf0\_Serializer. The method to determine how the data should be serialized is writeTypeMarker.

First example: $first = array('foo' => 5, 'bar' => 23) This array is serialized using the type marker AMF0\_MIXEDARRAY since it contains non-numeric keys. This results in receiving an Array-instance in action script which means the keys of the associative array are lost. Shouldn't this be serialized so that an Object-instance is received in action script?

Second example: $second = array(1 => 'foo', 5 => 'bar') This array is sparse (not dense, because of the gaps) but is serialized using the type marker AMF0\_ARRAY since it only contains numeric keys. This results in receiving an Array-instance in action script which means the keys are lost again since the array got reindexed. Shouldn't this be serialized as a sparse array (using the type marker) AMF0\_MIXEDARRAY so that an Array-instance is received in action script which retains the key-value mapping?

I modified the code where the type marker is determined for array data. The current implementation in svn version 1.7.0PL1 is (line 130-142):

case (is\_array($data)): // check if it is a mixed typed array foreach (array\_keys($data) as $key) { if (!is\_numeric($key)) { $markerType = Zend\_Amf\_Constants::AMF0\_MIXEDARRAY; break; } } // Dealing with a standard numeric array if(!$markerType){ $markerType = Zend\_Amf\_Constants::AMF0\_ARRAY; break; }

I modified the code to match my previous suggestions:

case (is\_array($data)): // check if it is an associative array $i = 0; foreach (array\_keys($data) as $key) { // check if it contains non-integer keys if (!is\_numeric($key) || intval($key) != $key) { $markerType = Zend\_Amf\_Constants::AMF0\_OBJECT; break; // check if it is a sparse indexed array } else if ($key != $i) { $markerType = Zend\_Amf\_Constants::AMF0\_MIXEDARRAY; break; } $i++; } // Dealing with a standard indexed array if(!$markerType){ $markerType = Zend\_Amf\_Constants::AMF0\_ARRAY; break; }

I hope it is possible to follow my desciptions. Please don't hesitate to ask me if anything is not clear.

For the Amf3-part i was not yet able to figure out how to force Zend\_Amf to use Amf3 and test that kind of serialization. But looking at the implementation of Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_Amf0\_Serializer::writeArray i am quite sure that it suffers the same problem.

I have taken the suggestions of this thread and implemented them into AMF0. I will open a new ticket for adding the changes into AMF3.
