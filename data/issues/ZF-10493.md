ZF-10493: Duplicate header problems with contextSwitch
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When a controller with an initContext() call in the init() method forwards (or in my case, I'm using Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action) to another controller that also calls initContext(), they send duplicate Content-type headers, which causes some servers to 500 (this particular server is using FastCGI). Would it be an appropriate fix to simply use the replace bit when setting headers from contextSwitch?

I can confirm this bug. Happens when error controller takes over after an exception is thrown for example.

Fix is easy:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    diff ContextSwitch.php ContextSwitch.php.bak 
    283c283
    <                 $response->setHeader($header, $content, true);
    ---
    >                 $response->setHeader($header, $content);
