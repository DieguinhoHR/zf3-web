### Description

Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_detectMimeType() method does not check the mime-type using HTTP headers, that may be quite safe if you are use a web server module, such as mod\_mime\_magic. I propose to add a special option that would allow to use mime-type from HTTP headers ($\_FILES array).
