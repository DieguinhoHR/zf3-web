ZF2-279: RestfulController does not work with automatic template injection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Execute() method in [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Mvc/Controller/RestfulController.php) checks for 'action' parameter in RouteMatch and if it's not present, goes on to automatically determine the method [of the Controller] to be called based on the HTTP verb (get/post/put/delete) of the user request.

The problem is, after determining the correct action (method to be called), that action name is not stored anywhere. So the injectTemplate() method in [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Mvc/View/InjectTemplateListener.php) goes on to use only the Controller's name for setting the template name (just 'index' instead of 'index/get' or 'index/create' or 'index/update' and so on). This is not the desired behavior.

RestfulController should set a RouteMatch action parameter based on the action taken (Controller method called), so that the template injection mechanism would try to use the template name expected. Alternatively, a differently named parameter could be set (say, '\_action') to differentiate for when the action is set by the router and when it's set by the controller (or anywhere outside the router), but this would require changes to \\Mvc\\View\\TemplateInjection.php and I currently consider this approach to be too cumbersome and unnecessary.

Your patch file wasn't generated right (it's blank), but I found the commit on your Github, cherry-picked it, and fixed the whitespace issues (tab vs 4 spaces). PR is here: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1491>
