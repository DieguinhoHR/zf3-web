ZF-7480: Zend\_Pdf: Add Spot Color support
------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-08-04T18:11:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:25.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently, it appears that the Zend\_Pdf component supports RGB, HTML, CMYK colours.

Unfortunately, it does not support Spot or Pantone (PMS) colours.

This would be a great improvement to add, as it would enable print-ready PDFs to be created from within PHP without the need for external libraries.
