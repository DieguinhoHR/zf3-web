ZF-5343: allow to define help text for remaining arguments
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-12-23T08:54:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:21.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently it looks like we cannot set help text for non-option arguments.

For example let's say my script allow one option (--opt1|o) and one mandatory argument ('filename') so that usage is: Usage: myscript.php [ options ] _filename_ --opt1|o opt1 gets activated

'filename' is not an option but an argument, without it the script is stopped. It would be great to be able to add argument names that would be displayed when calling ->getUsageMessage();

I want to second this request. It would also be great to get some way to get those non-option arguments into the usage summary

Right now, usage in the above example would look like:

Usage: myscript.php [ options ] --opt1|o opt1 gets activated

It would be nice to be able to do:

Usage: myscript.php [ options ] filename --opt1|o opt1 gets activated

or at least:

Usage: myscript.php [ options ] --opt1|o opt1 gets activated filename path to the file to work on

Thx

I was looking for this feature is the source. Currently the better way to display the usage message is to extend Zend\_Console\_Getopt and rewrite the usage message.

I would also request for a way to order these additional arguments:

usage: phpname.php action [ options ] instead of: usage: phpname.php [ options ] action

One very simple solution would be to split getUsageMessage like that:

    public function getUsageMessage()
    {
            $usage = "Usage: {$this->_progname} [ options ]\n";
            $usage .= $this->getOptionsMessage()
    }

/\*\* \* returns program name \* @return string \*/ public function getProgname() { return $this->\_progname; }

and new method getOptionsMessage, exactly like the current getUsagerMessage() minus the "usage" line. This would allow a simple way to display a custom usage message, including actions and additional mandatory argument.

Remy-

On its own, Zend\_Console\_GetOpt doesnt support arguments right? The only way we've managed to support argument is by adding an option to stop processing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       $getopt = new Zend_Console_GetOpt(..., ..., array('parseAll' => false))


That will force the getopt to stop on non-options.

Gilles-

See above on the argument point.

Also, I think its worth noting that usage messaging should probably be part of the application itself than the option parsing component.
