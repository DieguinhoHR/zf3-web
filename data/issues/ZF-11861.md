### Description

on #467 in Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Serializer.php when setting property names through foreach loop, problem occurs if object that needs to be mapped has internal array and implements some iterator interface. In foreach as keys you get keys of internal array and not property names. Simple workaround would be to get property names with `get_object_vars($object)` instead of just looping through object.
