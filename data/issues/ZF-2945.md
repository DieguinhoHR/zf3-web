### Description

When supplying an incorrect class to Zend\_Translate->setAdapter() no output is being generated at all!

Because this line hides the error: ```

The error would be for example: Fatal error: Class AlexL\_Translate\_Adapter contains 2 abstract methods and must therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods (Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::\_loadTranslationData, Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::toString) in C:\\WWW\\library\\AlexL\\Translate\\Adapter.php on line 3

Since the error is hidden while being a fatal one no output is being generated at all

It's not that easy... eliminating the suppression leads to other errors which are thrown throug Zend\_Loader itself while the exception is raised afterwards by the class itself.

This has to be reworked to eighter not use Zend\_Loader anymore, or find another way of recognising such errors while not braking the whole testbed.

yeah I already had the feeling that the @ must have had some reason. but the problem, as I described it, is really a little annoying since it took me a little while to even understand what just happened to my site... there was just nothing there ;-)

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Changed with r9082. But this has no effect as the class you implemented is false.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
