ZF-2214: Lazy database quering by Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db

### Description

I noticed that every log event database is queried with log message.

I know components should be universal and it could be problematic to use destructor by default - in case of uncatched exception it won't be called. So how about optional flag in constructor, which indicates that writer should use lazy load? Since front controller catches all exceptions, destructors problem disapears and It could be interesting improvement for developers using ZF MVC.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /*
     * Normal behaviour, every event saves message to database
     */
    $writer1= new Zend_Log_Writer_Db($db, 'log_table_name', $columnMapping);
    /*
     * Lazy loading is on, all messages are saved at the end of script
     */
    $writer2 = new Zend_Log_Writer_Db($db, 'log_table_name', $columnMapping, true);

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This problem would actually apply to all log writers, since even file writers get slow when logging a lot. This is a problem that I think we have to think through more, however, because we certainly wouldn't want to lose the logs just before a catastrophic failure in a production system just because they hadn't been flushed yet. I think the best place for this is a proposal in the proposal review section of the site: <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home>
