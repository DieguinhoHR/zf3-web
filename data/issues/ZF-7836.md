ZF-7836: SubForm elements not aware of all parents. (before render)

### Description

Sample code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Test extends Zend_Form{
        function init() {
            $this->setElementsBelongTo("tree");
            $branch = new Zend_Form();
            $branch->setElementsBelongTo("branch");
            $branch->addElement("text", "leaf");
            $this->addSubForm($branch, "branch");
            echo $this->getSubForm("branch")->getElement("leaf")->getFullyQualifiedName();
        }
    }


Echos "branch[leaf]" and not expected "tree[branch][leaf]" When the whole form is rendered the getFullyQualifiedName() of the element is (as expected) "tree[branch][leaf]".

Am I missing something here?
