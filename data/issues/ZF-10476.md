ZF-10476: I can't add function in a query

### Description

What I need is add a function at the beginning of the query but I don't know how do it using the zend db table.

I can do this:

$columns[0] = 'field 1'; $columns[1] = 'field 2'; $columns[2] = "CONCAT(field1, ' ', field2) as field3";

$query = $this->select()->from($this->\_name, $columns);

echo $query;

Output: SELECT `assets`.`field 1`, `assets`.`field 2`, CONCAT(field1, ' ', field2) AS `field3` FROM `assets` LIMIT 10

But I can't find a way to build a query with a function between the "SELECT" and the columns like this:

SELECT SQL\_CALC\_FOUND\_ROWS `assets`.`field 1`, `assets`.`field 2`, CONCAT(field1, ' ', field2) AS `field3` FROM `assets` LIMIT 10

Setting component to Zend\_Db and assigning to Ralph.

The only way to do it is to use this workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $columns[0] = new Zend_Db_Expr('SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS  field 1');
    $columns[1] = 'field 2';
    $columns[2] = new Zend_Db_Expr("CONCAT(field1, ' ', field2) as field3");
    $query = $this->select()>from($this>_name, $columns);

Zend\_Db in ZF 1 specifically does not utilize database specific SQL, in your case, the ability to add a keyword after the SELECT statement.

This is already accounted for in ZF2 in the architecture with the ability to opt-into plugins. These plugins can have platform specific features, like SQL\_CALC\_ROWS, etc.
