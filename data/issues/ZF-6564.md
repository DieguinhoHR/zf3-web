### Description

Since the LDAP implementation in ZF is minimal, it would be nice if we can extend Zend\_Ldap and reuse the _\_getAccount()_ method. So please change this function to _protected_ in stead of _private_.

Zend\_Ldap ist going to be replaced with a full LDAP implementation (hopefully in the next minor relase) and will be moved to the trunk within a short time. You can use Zend\_Ldap from the Standard Incubator in the meantime.
