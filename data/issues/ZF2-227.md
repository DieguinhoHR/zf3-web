ZF2-227: Add Backslashes to core function and constants calls
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Performance Improvement Created: 2012-03-18T16:38:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:23.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Replace all code like:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    namespace 'Zend\Blabla';
    ...
    $time = time();
    
    ...
    
    echo PHP_EOL;
    
    ...


to this way

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    namespace 'Zend\Blabla';
    ...
    $time = \time();
    
    ...
    
    echo \PHP_EOL;
    
    ...


It will increase the performance and security. Because php first looks for function in current namespace.

Function overloading example:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    
    namespace Zend\Date {
        function is_object($date) {
            echo "Zend Date constructor is called with param {$date}";exit;
        }
    }
    
    
    namespace Foo {
    
    require_once 'zf2/library/Zend/Loader/AutoloaderFactory.php';
    \Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory::factory(array('Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array()));
    
    $date = new \Zend\Date\Date('2012-03-18');
    
    }

h6.on performance I did simple benchmark, and it shows up to 8% improvement when calling global functions with slash whether it's a significant improvement is up to discussion

h6.on security Not sure it's a framework responsibility to address such "hacks"

I would close this issue. This is on the todo-list of the php-dev-team. We should not change the code here.

This could be done by a script as we don't define functions or global constants in ZF
