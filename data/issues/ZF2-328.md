ZF2-328: ZF2 should ship with factories for JsonStrategy and FeedStrategy

### Description

When I configured Zend\\View\\Strategy\\JsonStrategy and FeedStrategy through the ViewManager, I realized there were no factories in Service Manager for these components. I think we should figure a way for ZF2 to know how to instantiate these two built in strategies.

Actually, there are -- look in Zend\\Mvc\\Service. It's as simple to add them as this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array(
        'view_manager' => array(
            'strategies' => array(
                'ViewJsonStrategy',
                'ViewFeedStrategy',
            ),
        ),
    );


To make them work, there are also factories for the associated renderers.
