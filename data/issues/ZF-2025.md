### Description

If you have previously used setNoController function (of ViewRenderer Helper), to disable looking for the view in a sub-directory with the controller's name, in your actions controller, it will be over-written later due to a flaw.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            public function init()
            {
                    $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setRender('test');
                    $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoController(true);
            } 


This won't work, nor will it work using preDispatch(). The problem is on Zend/Controller/Action.php in this piece of code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getViewScript($action = null, $noController = null)
        {
            if (!$this->getInvokeArg('noViewRenderer') && $this->_helper->hasHelper('viewRenderer')) {
                $viewRenderer = $this->_helper->getHelper('viewRenderer');
                $viewRenderer->setNoController($noController);
                return $viewRenderer->getViewScript($action);
            }


$noController, a null value, is passed through setNoController function and the setNoController function assumes if the value isn't true, it's false. So null is considered false, and a value is set also it isn't supposed to.

I think either a test needs to be made in Actions.php or inside the setNoController function, for the null value.

Example in ViewRender helper:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($flag === null) {
                return;
            }


Or in Actions.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if ($noController !== null) {
                $viewRenderer->setNoController($noController);
        }


This caused me a major headache when I was trying to implement the code (which is pasted at beginning of the issue), and I had to use setNeverController() instead.
