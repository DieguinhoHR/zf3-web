ZF-4945: Zend\_File adds invalid html attributes to the view helper after validation

### Description

I just wanted to use Zend\_File for a new project, and discovered a serious bug. After submitting a file, and if the validation of some other field fails, Zend\_File adds the filename with number "0" as attribute name to the view helper, which then looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


This doesn't really matter for HTML sites, but for XHTML the browser stops with a "not well-formed XML" message. Hence I consider this as a blocker.

Do you use the file-view helper ? Because this helper does not display the value of the element.

The reason for this problem is not the file component but the ViewHelper. I was forced to add getValue to the form element because the form can not handle elements without value. But the file element does not have a value in HTML.

I expect that you get the above output when you don't use the proper view helper or decorator.

Here is the controller which creates the form and the class subclassing Zend\_Form for decorators.

Is there a reason why you erased the file validator from the file element ? lines 77-98 in your form

This prevents the file element from being rendered correct because you erased the file decorator which is attached per default.

You would have the same problem when you add a image and delete the image decorator from the image element.

Indeed that was it, exchainging the ViewHelper decorator with the File decorator for the File element fixed it. Probably this should be mentioned either in the docs that the Form\_Element\_File needs the File instead of the ViewHelper decorator, or even better let the File element see, if a ViewHelepr decorator was added, and automatically exchange it either with the File decorator or throw an exception.

It is not possible to throw an exception. The user must be able to give a own implementation of a file decorator.

The documentation mentions the file decorator.

It is only needed in some special cases.

- When you use XHTML
- When you use Subforms
- When you use MultiFiles

A request to the author of Zend\_Form regarding the problem of setDecorator for File, Images and other elements was until now not answered
