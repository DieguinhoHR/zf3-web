### Description

In order to retrieve UTF-8 data from a MySQL or Postgres database, it is sometimes necessary to execute the following SQL:

SET NAMES "utf8";

Otherwise, you can get question marks (?) in place of UTF-8 characters. As far as I know, neither MSSQL, DB2, or Oracle support this syntax. I would imagine that they have some method of setting the connection character encoding, unless the connection uses the encoding of the database.

I would suggest adding a "setEncoding()" method to the adapters that sets the connection's character encoding. This would be an empty method for the adapters that do not require setting the encoding. The encoding could also be an optional parameter sent to Zend\_Db::factory().

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
