### Description

Could you do the same thing as "\_messageClass" in the class "Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Abstract" allowing to use personal class to store Mail Message. In my application I use this class, but I'm oblige to copy/paste a big method which avoid any update of the framework.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    class Mail_Storage_Imap extends Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap {
    
        protected $_folderClass = 'Zend_Mail_Storage_Folder';
    
        public function __construct($params){
            parent::__construct($params);
    
            $this->onInit();
        }
    
        public function onInit(){
            $this->_messageClass = 'Mail_Message';
            $this->_folderClass  = 'Mail_Storage_Folder';
        }
    
        /**
         * get root folder or given folder
         *
         * @param  string $rootFolder get folder structure for given folder, else root
         * @return Zend_Mail_Storage_Folder root or wanted folder
         * @throws Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception
         * @throws Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception
         */
        public function getFolders($rootFolder = null)
        {
            ...
            $root = new $this->_folderClass('/', '/', false);
            ...
            $folder = new $this->_folderClass($localName, $globalName, $selectable);
            ...
        }
    }


I hope I could help you, Bye.
