### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::lastSequenceId() and nextSequenceId() return null, rather than throw an exception, when they are not supported. To me it seems logical to throw an exception when an unsupported operation is requested of a database adapter. If there are good reasons to return null or not to throw an exception, however, please consider this a non-issue.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

What if the user is currently using an Adapter that supports the operation but changes it later to an Adapter that doesn't support it.
