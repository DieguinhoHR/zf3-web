ZF-734: Several methods accept $gmt or $locale, but never use these parameters

### Description

The result of many methods do not change, whether the $gmt parameter is unset, false, or true.

If $gmt is not used, why is it a parameter?

I will begin documenting which ones.

Constistency... all functions have (almost) the same functionality

And correct results are not easy to mention if you dont have good date/time knowledge. Even I sometimes switch things, but reviewing the result all comes clear.

Example:

getIso supports $gmt: Setting GMT = TRUE will only have an effect if timestamp and timezone are closely together

Timezone+2, Timestamp 31.12.1999 23:00:00 will have a result of getIso(TRUE); -> 01.01.2000 01:00:00 +0200

You see in this situation the day, month, year, and hour are switching. In most situations the useage of $gmt should be avoided if the user does not know how it works... All functions were set to a default behaviour of GMT the user expexts.

In general the useage of GMT aviods the coding of following:

$myzone = $date->getTimeZone(); $date->setTimeZone('GMT'); $date->getIso(); $date->setTimeZone($myzone);

Hope this makes things a little bit clearer.

Object support was added to \_week, \_month, \_year, etc. in a previous changeset.

Thus, $gmt now makes sense for certain situations involving methods calling \_week, \_month, \_year, etc. When an ambiguous date or date part is provided to one of these methods, a timezone is needed to disambiguate the date / date part. For other values, such as a week number (e.g. the 3rd week of the year), the day of the week actually depends on the timezone, even though the timestamp (GMT/UTC) is the same.

The new patch, coming soon, for adding explicit timezone support and removing the $gmt parameter should resolve this issue.

The latest API change excluded GMT from all functions. The new behaviour is like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->setTimeZone('Europe/Vienna');
    $date->set('10:20:00');


Related to $locale. $locale is used for

- Parsing localized input
- Creating localized output
- Creating/Copying a locale object with another locale than the original
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('de_AT');
    $date->setTimeZone('Europe/Vienna');
    $date->set('JÃ¤nner', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date->set('May', Zend_Date::MONTH, 'en');
    print "\n".$date->toString('MMMM');
    print "\n".$date->toString('MMMM', 'en');
    $newone = $date->copy('en');
    print "\n".$newone->toString('MMMM');

The new API which was intruduced with SVN 2717 extracted GMT from all functions. So this issue is no longer raising.
