### Description

MySQL has a known issue that the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA is extremely slow.

See <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=19588>

This issue has been worked on a little bit, but it is still unresolved as of March 2007.

Since MySQL earlier than 5.0 does not implement the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA, and as of MySQL 5.0.37 (the current stable release) and MySQL 5.1.16-beta (the current beta release), the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA has such poor performance that it is unusable for web-based usage, the conclusion is that Zend Framework cannot use this mechanism.
