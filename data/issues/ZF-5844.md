### Description

Zend\_Dojo\_Form doesn't have the capability to use the Drag & Drop feature provided by Dojo. Though there are many Dojo Widgets which are not directly integrated in Zend\_Dojo\_Form, but DnD is one of the missing once which I am struggling to work with. If there any generic way exists to use all the Dojo Widgets through Zend\_Dojo\_Form or through writing helpers, then it need to be documented. I am finding it difficult to integrate the any Dojo Widget which is not being directly supported by Zend. Is there any simple way out which I am missing?
