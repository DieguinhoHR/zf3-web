### Description

When using the createRow and getMetaData methods on a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract model, the schema of the table is not taken into account. From what I can see the Adapter uses the following command to get the meta data:

$sql = "exec sp\_columns @table\_name = " . $this->quoteIdentifier($tableName, true); $stmt = $this->query($sql); $result = $stmt->fetchAll(Zend\_Db::FETCH\_NUM);

From the method definition:

public function describeTable($tableName, $schemaName = null)

The schema is passed to the method but never used. In Microsoft SQL Server, the sp\_columns command has the following syntax:

sp\_columns [ @table\_name = ] object [ , [ @table\_owner = ] owner ] [ , [ @table\_qualifier = ] qualifier ] [ , [ @column\_name = ] column ] [ , [ @ODBCVer = ] ODBCVer ]

The @table\_owner parameter seems to limit the meta data returned to the correct schema if this is passed into it.
