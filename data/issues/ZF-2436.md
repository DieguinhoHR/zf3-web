### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract shouldn't contain methods strictly related to HTTP transport. This doesn't make any sense for already existent Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Cli which extends this abstract class. Following methods should be moved to corresponding Http class:

- setHeader
- setRedirect
- isRedirect
- getHeaders
- clearHeaders
- setRawHeader
- getRawHeaders
- clearRawHeaders
- clearAllHeaders
- setHttpResponseCode
- getHttpResponseCode
- canSendHeaders
- sendHeaders
- sendResponse (should be refactored into two separate classes)

It would be nice to extract an Interface at the same time allowing for use of user created Response objects.

And another thing worth considering is extracting http header methods to it's own class. HTTP standard uses them in the same way for a request as well as a response .

I will be happy to work on this but I'm sure somebody should review this issue first. Feel free to assign it to me if you find it useful.

The reason I put the header information into the base request class was simply to make it trivial to switch out the response object to re-purpose an app from HTTP to the CLI. If those methods are removed, such a switch can be problematic, as code calling the header-specific methods will now cause the application to fail. With the current status, those methods are simply ignored on the CLI implementation.

Theoretically, we could intercept these via \_\_call(), but then we need to define that into the interface.

Before any work is done, I'd like to see some proposed code that addresses the issue of headers in a BC way.

Marking for next major version, as it would create potential BC issues.
