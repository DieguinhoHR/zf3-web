These tests are not finished for now. They should not have been commited, but they were just for closing 664-667.

I'm actualy working on them. It could last a few days to finish the 500 outstanding tests for add/sub/compare/cloneIt...

Pls dont add new issues due to bad tests, until this ticket is closed. Thnx.

No problem - thanks for your attention to the issue; I just wanted to make sure that the failing test results were recorded for future resolution, and this issue should do fine for that. :)

Thanks again for all your efforts!

All tests work without throwing errors or failures as with SVN 2443
