### Description

With the current socket adapter of the Zend\_Http\_Client you can have a script that will never return even if you have set a timeout value. This comes from the timeout option only applied on the opening and not on every I/O operations.

Here is a small script to show this issue :

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Http/Client.php';
    
    try {
        $uri = '<a href="http://www.lincolntribune.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5790">http://lincolntribune.com/modules/news/â€¦</a>';
        $client = new Zend_Http_Client($uri, array('timeout' => 2));
        $t_start = time();
        $response = $client->request('GET');
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        print 'ERROR: ' . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
    }
    $t_end = time();
    
    print 'time: ' . ($t_end - $t_start) . " secs\n";
    ?>

AFAIK this script should returns an exception if the creation of the connection or if a I/O operation takes more than 2 seconds. But as you can see, and you can wait as long as you want, it will never does and you will have to kill the script manually.

Here is the patch I use to correct the issue. It only adds a call to stream\_set\_timeout function after the connection to the selected host
