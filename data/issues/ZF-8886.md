ZF-8886: Improve lazy loading of page count
-------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-01-20T13:10:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-01-25T09:21:56.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

I don't see a reason for line 712:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_pageCount        = $this->_calculatePageCount();


This could be changed to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_pageCount        = null;


Page count would be then lazy loaded.

In r22829 (as in 1.10.8) it is line 711. I tested the suggestion by [~jsorgalla]. And everything works fine.
