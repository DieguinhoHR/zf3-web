### Description

Hello,

The patch <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11359> fixed the issue with isActive not been route aware.

The applied patch however doesn't work for chained routes.

See the <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11359> for more info

This issue depends on <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11443> When that is fixed, this will also work.

See the unittest for this problem at <http://pastie.org/2022127>

Freeaqingme, can you check this ? Sounds to be an easier fix for the problem...
