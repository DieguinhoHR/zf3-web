ZF-8926: Zend\_Validate\_Digits inconsistent behaviour with floats
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-25T06:46:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-27T12:27:31.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

If this is not a bug, then it may be worth mentioning as a special case in the documentation, because it caught me out.

 
    <pre class="highlight">require_once 'Zend/Validate/Digits.php';
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_Digits();
    
    var_dump($validator->isValid('1234567890123')); // bool(true)
    var_dump($validator->isValid(1234567890123)); // bool(false)
    var_dump($validator->getMessages());


A message is generated containing "'1.23456789012E+12' contains not only digit characters". Zend\_Validate\_Digits converts the value to a string and filters that.

If the above is the desired behaviour, then as mentioned before I think it's worth mentioning in the documentation that large floats are converted to scientific notation in the class.

Note that this is a language behaviour. I don't think that we must mention within the manual how to code with PHP.

Simply try the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $var = 1234567890123456789012345;
    var_dump($var);


As you see PHP itself converts numbers to float when they exceed a set value. When a number will be converted automatically is set by your PHP.ini configuration.

The reason why we can't simply say that floats are always digits is, that when someone really expects to get ONLY digits and we say OK for "1.2345E-11" then there would be a problem as there is a E and a - char which are no digits.

Closing as non-issue

Hi Thomas, I know the behaviour of PHP and converting to floats, but this is a comment about the string representation of floats. I wouldn't expect that string '1.23456789012E+24' be validated by the class, as this would be wrong. But is it not at least worth mentioning that validating a float greater than 10^12 will behave differently than a float which is less than 10^12 but greater than PHP\_INT\_MAX? It might not be inherently obvious why 2147483648 validates but 1234567890123456789012345 doesn't.

I don't think so... because this validator checks only DIGITS... even a integer with a negative sign is not valid as the minus is no digit.

People working with such big numbers know what this works only with BCMath which means to have only strings.

Note that "Digit" does not mean "Number"!
