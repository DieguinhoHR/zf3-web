For info: I was said to delay this implementation until Zend\_Image has been officially released.

What is the status of Zend\_Image? Will it be included in ZF 1.12?

Accepted Proposal: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Image+-+Dolf+Schimmel) Code: [http://framework.zend.com/code/listing.php/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/listing.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Fincubator%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FImage%2F)

If there are no plans for Zend\_Image in ZF1 this issue should be closed as "Won't Fix"
