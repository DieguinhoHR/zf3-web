### Description

Disable the layout in Zend\_Rest\_Controller

The user can disable the layout himself/herself. But it's nice to have the layout disabled by default when requests are routed to Zend\_Rest\_Controller.

If you like a patch, let me know. :)

I disagree with this. REST does not imply that there will not be a layout by any means, and I actually have RESTful resources that display both HTML as well as JSON; the former uses a layout, while the latter does not.

Besides the reasons mentioned in my previous comment, changing the behavior at this point would be a backwards compatibility break. Both are sufficient reasons to close this issue.
