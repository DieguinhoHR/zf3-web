Jeffrey, Can you provide same code demonstrating what you were doing when you received this error?

Also, what version of Zend Framework are you using?

Unfortunately I can't provide an example as the data I'm working with is under NDA. The issue arises when the parser encounters a cdata node. I assume this is because childNodes is null on a CDATA node so the foreach loop doesn't like it. transferFromDOM should probably check if childNodes isn't null (and possibly the same for attributes).

Zend/Gdata/App/Base.php:

 
    public function transferFromDOM($node)
    {
        // CDATA nodes don't have children
        if ( $node->childNodes != null ) {
            foreach ($node->childNodes as $child) {
                $this->takeChildFromDOM($child);
            }
        }
        // CDATA nodes don't have attributes
        if ( $node-> attributes != null ) {
            foreach ($node->attributes as $attribute) {
                $this->takeAttributeFromDOM($attribute);
            }
        }
    }

Jeffrey, Thanks for that information. However, before I can commit a fix to this, I'd really like to:

a. Verify that the code I'm committing is actually fixing something, and b. Write a test case to prevent regressions

Neither of which I can do until I'm able to reproduce this on my end.

Would you at least be able to provide me with some (possibly obfuscated) XML that will reproduce this problem?

Resolving this as incomplete. Feel free to reopen with specific information on how to reproduce this issue.
