ZF-5607: Allow validators to validate whole Multi field, not every value.

### Description

I strongly suggest to give full control over the method of validating Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi elements!

As for now validators are run on _each and every_ selected value, but there is no way to validate THE WHOLE FIELD, nor give it a GLOBAL SINGLE custom error message.

Current architecture does not allow i.e. to create a Zend\_Validate\_Count which would throw error if less (or more) number of fields have been selected. It also is buggy (see ZF-5603 and ZF-5412).
