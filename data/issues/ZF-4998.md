ZF-4998: Update Json\_Server docs to reflect usage with dojox.rpc.Service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Improvement Created: 2008-11-19T13:02:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:02.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When using dojox.rpc.Service, setting the json server as dojo compatible will not work as the new dojox.rpc.Service object is standards compliant. The documentation should make note that dojo compatibility should not be used in such a case, and that the envelope should be set to Zend\_Json\_Server\_Smd::ENV\_JSONRPC\_2.
