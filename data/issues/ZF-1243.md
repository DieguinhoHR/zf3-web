### Description

It would be very nice to have a debian package. (Like Smarty has: <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/smarty>)

There's not even an official PEAR channel as of yet, so i'm not sure how likely that is to happen. Maybe you could maintain your own debian package for ZF?

I don't know, how to provide the auto update functionality via apt-get :/

We do not have the resources to support Debian, RPM, pkgadd, or other operating system specific installation technology.

The most likely installation technology we will implement is PEAR, and we aren't there yet.
