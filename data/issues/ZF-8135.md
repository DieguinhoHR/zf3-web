ZF-8135: fetchOne/fetchRow LIMIT 1 inconsistency
------------------------------------------------

### Description

The fetchRow and fetchOne functions in Pdo behave differently than the ones in the Table object. The Table ones correctly(?) specify LIMIT 1, whereas the ones in Pdo are essentially fetching an entire result set and then grabbing the [0] element of it.

This results in a significant performance hit on large tables, but can be worked-around by manually putting in "LIMIT 1" on individual queries or, of course, self-patching those two functions in Pdo.

Can you supply proof-of-concept patch and/or patch for the buggy behavior?
