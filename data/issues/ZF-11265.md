ZF-11265: Zend\_Mime\_Decode::decodeQuotedPrintable() doesn't work at all

### Description

The method decodeQuotedPrintable() of Zend\_Mime\_Decode does not decode "quoted-printable" content.

It internally calls iconv\_mime\_decode(). However, this PHP function performs an entirely different action.

Instead, quoted\_printable\_decode() would have to be used.

However, decodeQuotedPrintable() is not used at any other place in the Zend framework. Also, it is unlikely that any other application uses this method, as it doesn't work. Since quoted\_printable\_decode() already performs this job very well, it is unclear to me why this method exists at all.

So I propose to simply remove this method, in order to not confuse programmers anymore.

New patch: remove\_useless\_method\_Zend\_Mime\_Decode\_decodeQuotedPrintable.patch

remove the useless and non-functioning method Zend\_Mime\_Decode::decodeQuotedPrintable()

Instead, programmers should use the simple (and working) quoted\_printable\_decode() function.
