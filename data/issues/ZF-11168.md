### Description

I have my doctype set as _Zend\_View\_Helper\_Doctype::XHTML5._

When i add a stylesheet, I want to be able to specify the media types inside this stylesheet using the at-media rule (<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html#at-media-rule>) to limit the use of multiple stylesheets. But _Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadLink_ still adds the media attribute to the link tag, even if i set it to null or false.

The same goes for the type="text/css" attribute, which can be omitted in HTML5.

I think there should be a check to see if the doctype is HTML5, and that's true, the type attribute should not be required anymore. And I also think that the media attribute shouldn't be required either, but I think that it shouldn't be required for all doctypes and not just HTML5.
