This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.

This is available (but needs a lot of filling out) at [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Testing+Standards) and in MAtthew's Zend\_Test docs. The unit testing standards for ZF itself should provide unit testing standards for the end user. We need to discuss where these standards would live. Postponing for now as we won't be able to put time in to this for the next release.

Matthew, assigning to you in case you have other docs to point to. The need is clear, especially now that we have Zend\_Test. Let me know what you would like to do with this issue. Is postponing OK with you?

Postponing is fine. I'd like to address it soon, but not necessarily prior to 1.8.
