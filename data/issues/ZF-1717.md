ZF-1717: Undefined index in Zend/Locale/Format.php

### Description

Unfortunately I cannot _really_ reproduce this issue - it sometimes happens and is gone when I reload the page (in the browser).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: Undefined index: default in /usr/share/ZendFramework-1.0.0/library/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 917
    Notice: Undefined index: pattern in /usr/share/ZendFramework-1.0.0/library/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 920


So I briefly checked inside the class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $format = Zend_Locale_Data::getContent($locale, 'defdateformat', 'gregorian');


I have no means to track it, but apparently it's some sort of race conditions. Maybe the response in $format should be doublechecked?

I am not able to reproduce this so I need your help as it seems to be related to your server/installation.

In the latest SVN please add the following lines or similar: in Zend\_Locale\_Format before line 918 : var\_dump($locale); in Zend\_Locale\_Data in line 250: var\_dump($locale); in Zend\_Locale\_Data before line 436: var\_dump(self::$\_list); in Zend\_Locale\_Data before line 205: var\_dump($result);

and give me the results on a failed request as you described it. Maybe you are also able to give data on how often this occurs... 1 of xxx requests ?

Thomas,

I'll try to reproduce it next week with all data etc. by next week.

Thanks for looking into it!

Hey Thomas,

I tried to reproduce it today and I had no luck - sorry. ;-( So I guess you either close, or try on your own. If I ever run into this again, I'll make sure to try to track this.

Again, I think it wouldn't hurt to actually "double check" on $format. I can't rule out that the data used was messed up. But then I am thinking it should throw an exception, or "return false;" and never get as far.

The only ways to get this results would be:

\*) Someone has edited the locale data files \*) Useage of PHP4 instead of PHP5

Otherwise you would get an Zend\_Locale\_Exception from Data while reading.

Added new exceptions for handling race conditions with SVN 5721

But as the failure is not reproduceable a real "fix" is not possible.

Thanks for the exception. :-)

In regard to editing the locale files - we have not yet, they are standard Gentoo. We also use PHP4 - that's 1,000,000% sure.

And maybe I should gain clue - we use PHP5 of course! =)

It would have wondered me if exceptions work with PHP4 ;-)

 

 

Posted by Till Klampaeckel (till) on 2007-07-16T16:54:45.000+0000

No, no, we really have PHP5!!! PEE-AGE-PEE-FIVE.

Thanks for the heads up! Appreciate all the work.
