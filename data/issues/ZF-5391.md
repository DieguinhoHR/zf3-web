### Description

Asked Wade and he asked me to shoot it as a bug.

I've been trying to use serverside remoting in FMS3 with ZendAMF but no luck. I get "onStatus>info.code: Client.Header.BadVersion" in FMSLiveLog

But when i try to use the samegateway with Flex there is np and eveything works smooth.

Thought it might be smthing related to amf version but FMS3 should also use AMF3?

I think this issue is indeed FMS3 related. when I checked the $HTTP\_RAW\_POST\_DATA ( <a>php://input</a> ) and FMS3 reports its objectEncoding version as 0x01 not 0x00 or 0x03. It could be a bug or part of the FMS failsave for connecting to AMF0 encoded servers I don't know.

Anyways, added a check at class Zend\_Amf\_Request at function readMessage solved it for me.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Takes the raw AMF input stream and converts it into valid PHP objects
         *
         * @param  Zend_Amf_Parse_InputStream
         * @return Zend_Amf_Request
         */
        public function readMessage(Zend_Amf_Parse_InputStream $stream)
        {
            $clientVersion = $stream->readUnsignedShort();
            if (($clientVersion != Zend_Amf_Constants::AMF0_OBJECT_ENCODING)
                // Added Check for 0x01 for FMS. Could be defined a const as well.
                && ($clientVersion != 0x01) 
                && ($clientVersion != Zend_Amf_Constants::AMF3_OBJECT_ENCODING)
            ) {
                require_once 'Zend/Amf/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Amf_Exception('Unknown Player Version ' . $clientVersion);
            }


Hope this helps.
