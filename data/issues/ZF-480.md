ZF-480: [Coding Standard] Odd parameter order for Zend\_Cache::save()
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2006-11-03T21:11:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:25.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

Throughout the framework, the standard parameter order seems to be "name, object", which is sort of like "key => value". For instance, see Zend::register(), Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter::addRoute(), and even PHP internals like \_\_set(). Zend\_Cache::save(), however, is "object, name", which seems backwards.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

it's not a good idea because in main cases, the id is not given (optional)

I don't understand the use case where you wouldn't use an ID for save().
