I got this working without any problems! (so long as your disabled option has no value set.)

$this->\_select->addMultiOption('','Please Select...'); //default select option with no value $this->\_select->setAttrib('disable',array('')); //set disable on option with value of '' $this->\_select->setRequired(true); //make sure user picks something!

then add the other enabled options :-)

$this->\_select->addMultiOption($row->value,$row->name); //options to select

hope this helps :-)
