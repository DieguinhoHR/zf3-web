ZF-10962: Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_\* classes have useless private variable

### Description

All these adapters share a private variable: private $\_data = array();

If you look at the code, it is not used anywhere else than in the \_loadTranslationData() method, which initializes it each time it is called: $this->\_data = array();

So it could be just a simple variable inside the method. And we can also see weird code like this one in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Ini:

 
        $this->_data = array();
        if (!file_exists($data)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Ini file '".$data."' not found");
        }
    
        $inidata = parse_ini_file($data, false);
        if (!isset($this->_data[$locale])) {
            $this->_data[$locale] = array();
        }


why this last isset() test? $this->\_data has just been initialized, so the condition will always be false, and the code inside will \*always\* be executed.

The code for all the adapters could be simplified. Is there a specific reason for this?

And how should the xml parser return read informations when there is no variable within the object? Wouldn't it be useless when the adapter can not store the information anywhere?

I agree, so why reinitialize it at the beginning of each \_loadTranslationData() call?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _loadTranslationData($filename, $locale, array $options = array())
        {
            $this->_data = array();

Because otherwise it would add new data to existing probably broken data. When someone extends the class it can not be assumed that he calls this method only once at construction.

I understand your point, but it still doesn't explain the need for populating a private $\_data variable, which is not used anywhere else in the class, and cannot be used anywhere else in the application.

Take for example this function in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Ini:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        private $_data = array();
    
        protected function _loadTranslationData($data, $locale, array $options = array())
        {
            $this->_data = array();
            if (!file_exists($data)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Ini file '".$data."' not found");
            }
    
            $inidata = parse_ini_file($data, false);
            if (!isset($this->_data[$locale])) {
                $this->_data[$locale] = array();
            }
    
            $this->_data[$locale] = array_merge($this->_data[$locale], $inidata);
            return $this->_data;
        }


It could be simplified to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _loadTranslationData($data, $locale, array $options = array())
        {
            if (!file_exists($data)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Ini file '".$data."' not found");
            }
    
            $inidata = parse_ini_file($data, false);
            return array($locale => $inidata);
        }


Which behaviour would be affected?

You said "All adapters should be simplified"... and then "The code for all the adapters could be simplified"... which implies according to what you've wrote "delete the private var $\_data". As I said before $\_data is used by all adapters which are calling a XML reader.

Integrating your change would mean that half of the adapters are no longer working.

The actual code allows to use the new adapters even in old ZF releases. We will break BC with ZF2 where such things are allowed.

I'm sorry Thomas, I must be lost somewhere. Yes, the XmlTm adapter for example uses the private $\_data in other methods, this justifies the need for it. But could you please point me out what behavior not using, or even removing this variable in the adapters that don't use it, would break?

This variable, for most (not _all_, as you pointed out...) of the adapters is not required in the class, and is not required anywhere else. It seems more like a copy and paste from one adapter to the other than a choice made on purpose!

And leads to extra, useless code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_data = array();
    if (!isset($this->_data[$locale])) {
    ...

Fixed with GH-131
