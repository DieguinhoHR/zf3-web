### Description

When you create a controller with "zf create controller index 1 blog", the IndexControllerTest.php get's stored under with the following comment:

Creating a controller test file at /..../tests/application/controllers/IndexControllerTest.php

But it should be stored unter

/..../tests/application/modules/blog/controllers/IndexControllerTest.php

I also noticed this issue. Also when you create another index controller in another module it will overwrite the existing IndexControllerTest in tests/controllers

I have the same problem. Tests for contollers does not support modular structure!
