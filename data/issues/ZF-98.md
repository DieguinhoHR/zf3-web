### Description

I was wondering about the Controller/Actions loop in Front Controller, and I think that can be useful an embedded messenger subsystem, toward to improve the communication beetwen actions - for example (in the real world) some use case actions.

Actually this can be done by singleton register method (Zend::register and Zend::registry), registering a class to restore previous messages (errors, informations, confirmations, ...).

By doing this, the message can be raised anywhere during the action:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->raiseMessage(' The message itself ', ActionMessage::ERROR_MESSAGE);


I've coded a simple class to get the idea (and maybe for snippet code):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    /**
     * Class for Handling Messages beetwen actions
     *
     * @copyright  Copyright (c) 2006
     * @license    GPL
     */
    class ActionMessage {
        private $messages = array();
        private $errors = array();
        private $confirmations = array();
        
        const ERROR = "error"; 
        const CONFIRMATION = "confirmation"; 
        const MESSAGE = "message"; 
        
        public function appendTo($msg, $type = self::MESSAGE) {
            if ($type == self::ERROR) {
                $this->errors[]['msg'] = $msg ;
            }
            else if ($type == self::CONFIRMATION) {
                $this->confirmations[]['msg'] = $msg ;
            }
            else if ($type == self::MESSAGE) {
                $this->messages[]['msg'] = $msg ;
            }
        }
        
        public function haveMessagesAt($type = self::MESSAGE) {
            if ($type == self::ERROR) {
                return (count($this->errors) > 0) ? true : false ;
            }
            else if ($type == self::CONFIRMATION) {
                return (count($this->confirmations) > 0) ? true : false ;
            }
            else if ($type == self::MESSAGE) {
                return (count($this->messages) > 0) ? true : false ;
            }
        }
        
        public function getAllErrors() {
            return $this->errors ;
        }
        
        public function getAllMessages() {
            return $this->messages ;
        }
        
        public function getAllConfirmations() {
            return $this->confirmations ;
        }
        
        public function getLastError() {
            return $this->errors[count($this->errors)-1] ;
        }
        
        public function getLastMessage() {
            return $this->messages[count($this->messages)-1] ;
        }
    
        public function getLastConfirmation() {
            return $this->confirmations[count($this->confirmations)-1] ;
        }   
        
        
    }
    
    ?>


My best regards...

Messages can be passed by using the $params argument of Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_forward().

Doing bookkeeping. Not sure why this was reopened. Might have been a mistake I made. Please reopen with a comment if it really isn't resolved.

As Mike noted, messages can be passed using the request object parameters during \_forward(). Additionally, if you need "flash" messages between requests, we now have the FlashMessenger action helper. Anything beyond this would require a formal proposal at this point.

Greetings All,

FYI, I've created a PriorityMessenger which I believe fulfills the need being addressed here - please check it out and tell me what you think? <http://emanaton.com/code/php/zendprioritymessenger>
