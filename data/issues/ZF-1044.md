ZF-1044: Clarify argument lists of insert(), update() and delete()

### Description

This patch just cleans up the argument lists for the insert(), update() and delete() methods of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract.

The second argument to the insert() and update() methods (the data array), is required for these functions to operate. There's no code checking for the presence of this argument; it's assumed to be present. This patch adds the "array" type hint, forcing the argument to be required, and clarifying the intent of the argument.

In the update() and delete() methods, the 'where' clause argument is effectively optional. SQL doesn't require it, and omitting it is a perfectly valid thing to do. The code in the method bodies already works without it. This patch simply gives that argument a default value of the empty string so that a warnig isn't raised when the argument is omitted, and clarifying the fact that it's optional.

See also ZF-1038, which suggests improvements to these methods by supporting Zend\_Db\_Expr.
