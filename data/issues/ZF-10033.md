### Description

I want to define the metadata's cache from application configuration. Zend\_Db::factory() can not define logically the cache for metadata of DbTables. So, I think that is the resource Db allow that.

Will evaluate later (probably in 24 hours). Thanks for the patch _with_ unittests (that's what makes a maintainer happy)

Fix the dependency between the two unit tests. The metadata cache is stored in a static attribut. So we have to clean it after a test.

I have not found how to delete the previous patch.

Fix the compatibilty with a case sensitive filesystem. Sorry, I did not know how the method Zend\_Cache::\_\_normalizeName() works for backends using multiple words.
