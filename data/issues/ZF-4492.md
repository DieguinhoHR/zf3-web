### Description

Microsoft has recently released its own rewrite module for IIS7.0. (See: [http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/460/â€¦](http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/460/using-url-rewrite-module/)). As this module is free, I guess it will quickly become the main rewrite module for IIS. So I would suggest to adapt the appropriate parts of the documentation to cater for this module as well. As a starter, I will give you the web.config settings I used to define the basic rewrite rule to get the quick start application to work:

These settings rewrite requests to index.php except for: - (a known set of) resource files - existing files - existing directories

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <system.webServer> </system.webServer>

However, 1 issue remains (at least): - using the above rules, I get "index.php" in the result of calls to $this->url(array('controller' => '...', 'action' => '...')) in views and layouts. So far I did not find a way to prevent this

Anyway, I still hope you can use this

Is this a duplicate of ZF-4491?

Not a duplicate. This one (ZF-4492) targets the documentation, ZF-4491 targets the code.

Matthew, has this been added to the ref guide somewhere? Should it? Should it be added to the quickstart?

Has not been added; I have more information from Dmitry that needs to be incorporated as well.
