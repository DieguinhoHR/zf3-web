### Description

Zend\_Pdf class provides properties() method, but it still not implemented.

There were already several requests to have this functionality done in FW-General.

PS There also was an idea to have this done as object property, but not as a method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($pdf->properties as $key => $value) {
        ...
    }
    echo $pdf->properties->creator;
    $pdf->properties->creator = 'someone'
