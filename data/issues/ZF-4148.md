ZF-4148: Workaround offsetExists Method
---------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-01T02:46:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-24T10:17:19.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Registry offsetExists does not work anymore in the current PHP5.3 snapshot. It allways returns false, because the storage Property of ArrayObject is private and your not able to access the indexes of the array. If I'll remove the "workaround" offsetExists it is working without any problems.

Maybe the bug is fixed now in php5.3 snapshot and the workaround is no longer used.

Any insight on this, Stas?

Replace return array\_exists($index, $this) with property\_exists($this, $index). property\_exists exists since PHP 5.1.0.

Looks like right now array\_key\_exists has BC break from 5.2 so it doesn't work correctly on objects. Probably needs a fix in PHP.

Is there a bugtrack filled in PHP bug tracking system for this ?

It seems it is a "feature", not a bug, according to the "PHP 5.3 Upgrading notes" page here : <http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53>

Changes to functions affecting backwards compatibility [...] array\_key\_exists() now does not work on objects.

property\_exists cannot be used, as it seems (in PHP 5.3) that it can just list declared properties. Of course Zend\_Registry has dynamic attributes. Here is the workaround I'm currently using:

File "Zend/Registry.php": public function offsetExists($index) { return array\_key\_exists ($index,get\_object\_vars ($this)); }

This patch fixed the problem.

array\_key\_exists should be back to BC in 5.3, so should not be an issue anymore.
