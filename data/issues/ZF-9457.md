### Description

ZF Version 1.11.0dev

Following error is being thrown SEVERITY: E\_USER\_ERROR ERRNO: 0 TEXT: RecursiveDirectoryIterator::\_\_construct(/usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWMod/default/language/.svn/tmp/prop-base): failed to open dir: Too many open files LOCATION: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php, line 177 Showing backtrace: [9] RecursiveDirectoryIterator.\_\_construct("/usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWMod/default/language/.svn/tmp/prop-base", "0") # line 0, file: unknown [8] RecursiveDirectoryIterator.getChildren() # line 177, file: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php [7] Zend\_Translate\_Adapter.addTranslation("/usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWMod/default/language") # line 0, file: unknown [6] call\_user\_func\_array(Array[2], Array[1]) # line 175, file: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/Zend/Translate.php [5] Zend\_Translate.\_\_call("addTranslation", Array[1]) # line 0, file: unknown [4] Zend\_Translate.addTranslation("/usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWMod/default/language") # line 131, file: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWare/Service/Language.php [3] ZWare\_Service\_Language.addTranslation("/usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWMod/default/language") # line 100, file: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWare/Service/Module.php [2] ZWare\_Service\_Module.load() # line 45, file: /var/www/vhosts/ffx/application/bootstrap.php [1] include("/var/www/vhosts/ffx/application/bootstrap.php") # line 2, file: /var/www/vhosts/ffx/httpdocs/index.php

Zend\_Translate is initially being set up as follows: self::$\_translator = new Zend\_Translate('tmx',$dir,null,array('ignore' => '.')); //$dir = /usr/local/ZWare/lib/ZWare/language

It is then subsequently called to add new translation paths with: self::$\_translator->addTranslation($source);

Language file caching is being used.

It appears that even though we want to ignore file paths with . (i.e. to avoid .svn) the recursive iterator at l176 of Zend\_Translate\_Adapter is not ignoring them during its directory scan and is running out of file handles. I increased PHP memory to 256MB from 128MB and this _appears_ to have solved the problem. I don't think you can do anything with this unless you replace the recursivedirectoryiterator with the way we used to do these things or perhaps file a request upstream to PHP devs to allow filtering in the iterator.

Closing as non-issue

We can not remove SPL methodology. The problem is that the mass of files you are looping through is too much.

The only solution would be \* To add more memory \* To avoid searching that much files/directories (by collecting together into one or a handful directories instead of searching the whole HDD) \* File an issue within PHP
