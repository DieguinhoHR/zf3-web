### Description

When using view helpers that extend Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Standalone (HeadMeta, HeadTitle, etc), calling methods that will proxy to the container class will fail when those methods are not public. Currently, there is only one non-public method in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract, which is \_getWhiteSpace(). This is used when specifying indentation in the toString() method, and will trigger a PHP warning on line 207 in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Standalone.

Either, the \_getWhiteSpace() method should be made public and the references to it should be updated, or there should be a check in the proxy to discard calls to non-public methods.

Scheduling for RC2... if possible.
