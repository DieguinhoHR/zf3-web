ZF-2462: Add setting validator message template support to the Zend\_Form\_Element:

### Description

Creating a Zend\_Form with a config/array doesn't support setting validator's message templates. It would be simple to add this with a setValidatorMessages() method to Zend\_Form\_Element. The setOptions will then transform a array/config's 'validatorMessages' key and call the method.

Or is this the wrong way to go? Perhaps it's more appropriate to do any relevant validator setMessage calls from a sub-classed form class? It seems to be write more classes vs grow the config. Hmm. Now I'm beginning to wish I hadn't raised the issue.

The appropriate way to do this is through the options array passed when creating the validator, and I will add support for doing so. As an example use case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->addValidator('NotEmpty', array('messages' => array('notEmpty' => 'Element must not be empty')));


Or you can set them after the fact:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->getValidator('NotEmpty')->setMessage('notEmpty', 'Element must not be empty');


or set them via a config:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = array(
        'validators' => array(
            array('validator' => 'NotEmpty', 'options' => array('messages' => array('notEmpty' => 'Element must not be empty')))),
            // ...
        ),
    );
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element('foo', $config);


As for a 'setValidatorMessages()', I'll take it under advisement. However, I think the better way to affect all messages is to use Zend\_Translate, as this allows you to set the messages however you wish them to appear for your locale. Simply use the validator error codes as the messageids, and assign the appropriate values you wish to display.

I tested the last example. Maybe the support isn't in yet as it gave the default message with r7696. Thanks for explaining however.

The phrase "I will add..." was key here -- I haven't done so yet. :-)

Resolved in r7710. You can now pass a 'messages' key in the options passed to addValidator(); if set, and an array, it will pass the value to the validator's setMessages() method, setting the message templates:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->addValidator(
        'digits', 
        false, 
        array('messages' => array('stringEmpty' => 'The value is empty; please enter some digits')));
