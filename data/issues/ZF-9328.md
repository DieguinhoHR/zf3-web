ZF-9328: Disabling the ViewRenderer

### Description

This is more of an issue with Zend\_Controller\_Front than Zend\_Controller however I did not see that option in the components selection box.

I was trying to disable my view renderer on a global level and I was referencing this document: <http://devzone.zend.com/article/2072>

2 Methods have worked for me. The application.ini (1) and disabling in _every_ controller (2).

1.) resources.frontController.params.noViewRenderer = true 2.) $this->\_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender(true);

What I could not get to work is our preferred method and that is in my Bootstrap.php file.

 
    public function _doNotRenderViews() {
        Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->setParam('noViewRenderer', true);
    }


I tried to do this in both the application bootstrap and the module(s) bootstrap. Both attempts led to me getting an error like the following:

Exception information: Message: script 'products/categories.phtml' not found in path (/home/jocrawfo/workspace/Ovi ZF 2.0/application/modules/juniper/views/scripts/)

It seems like the first 2 methods work but the 3rd method does not

Try defining the method as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _initDoNotRenderViews()
        {
            $this->bootstrap('frontcontroller');
            $this->getResource('frontcontroller')->setParam('noViewRenderer', true);
        }


As noted in the Zend\_Application docs, _protected_ methods prefixed with "\_init" will be run automatically when you bootstrap. The above method follows that rule, and also uses the dependency tracking features of Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap to ensure we have a front controller object and that it has been configured.
