### Description

I get this error when using Zend HTTP Client w/ SSL. (note: it does work, but why am I getting this error?)

[WARN] PHP Startup: SSL: fatal protocol error (/var/www/OLT/includes/zf/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php:205)

code used: $config = array( 'adapter' => 'Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket', 'ssltransport' => 'ssl', 'maxredirects' => 0, 'timeout' => 300 );

 
        /**
         * Set the URL to post to (test or live)
         */
        $url = ..
    
        $client  = new Zend_Http_Client( $url , $config );
    
        $request_id = md5(uniqid('IN'));
    
        // set up http headers
        $headers[] = "Content-Type: text/xml"; //or maybe text/xml
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-Timeout: 15";
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-OS-Version: RHEL 4";  // OS Version
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Client-Type: PHP/Zend_Http_Client";  // What you are using
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Client-Version: 0.01";  // For your info
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Client-Architecture: x86";  // For your info
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Client-Certification-Id: 63bcc2113fe2893d8b191d2d011b7fdc"; // get this from Todd
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Integration-Product: PHPv5";  // For your info, would populate with application name
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-VIT-Integration-Version: 0.01"; // Application version
        $headers[] = "X-VPS-Request-ID: " . $request_id;
    
        $client->setHeaders($headers);
    
        /**
         * Set data in post variables for Zend post
         */
        while (list($key,$val) = each($this->aTrans)) {
            $client->setParameterPost( $key , $val );
        }
    
        // post request and get a response object back
        $httpResponse = $client->request("POST");

Hi,

I have several questions: \* What is the target web server? \* Do you get any other warning message except for the one you mention?

Also, please try to change the 'ssltransport' parameter to 'sslv2' and check if the warning is still emmited.

BTW, I am not sure what is the type of $this->aTrans but it's very likely you can do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Set data in post variables for Zend post
     */
    // The (array) casting is only required if $this->aTrans is an ArrayObject or something similar
    $client->setParameterPost((array) $this->aTrans);
    
    //while (list($key,$val) = each($this->aTrans)) { $client->setParameterPost( $key , $val ); }

OK.. i did that.. changed config to equal >>

$config = array( 'adapter' => 'Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket', 'ssltransport' => 'sslv2', 'maxredirects' => 0, 'timeout' => 300 );

GOT THIS ERROR:

PHP Startup: SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:1406D0CB:SSL routines:GET\_SERVER\_HELLO:peer error no cipher (/var/www/OLT/includes/zf/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php:114)"

What server are you trying to connect to? If that server is accessible and open, please provide it' s address so I can test.

Payflow Pro's servers..

in comment above you see the URL...

pilot-payflowpro.verisign.com:443

i also get the same error when connecting to many other sites with same issue

There is something funny with this server as far as I can tell. I am not getting your error message, but I get no response (simply no data).

I get the same when I try to hit the same URL with Firefox and wget - so I don't see how this is a client problem.

Unless there is some very specific data I have to send to the server otherwise the connection closes with no HTTP response?

Do you have a similar problem with some other server?

That's because this is a merchant credit card processor. I can't send you the entire posted variables because it contains usernames and passwords..

but go ahead and try it like this.. (i removed password, so you should get an error)..

try these variables posting in..

$client->setParameterPost( $key , $val );

for all of these: USER= inhouse VENDOR= inhouse PARTNER= InHouseTicketing PWD=test NAME= test test COMMENT1= test test STREET= 33test ZIP= 12345 COMMENT2= 123421341234123 ACCT= 4111111111111111 CVV2= 123 EXPDATE= 0510 TRXTYPE= A TENDER= C AMT= 125.27 USER= inhouse VENDOR= inhouse PARTNER= InHouseTicketing PWD= drag0n1 TRXTYPE= D TENDER= C ORIGID= V78E0B52A5BD

Ok, thanks - I've added the details and now I get a proper response (404 error code with some "User authentication failed" error in the body).

This looks perfectly normal - I don't get any PHP warning or error omitted.

Are you getting a similar error with other HTTPS hosts? Try, for example, with <https://www.paypal.com/> and let me know if you get any errors.

Perhaps there is some issue with the SSL libraries your PHP is compiled with. If you can attach your phpinfo() that would be helpful.

<http://olt.inticketing.com/is.php>

Note: everything works.. it just spits out warning that's all. I have gotten this on other PHP installations with freebsd too.

Sorry for all the questions, it's just that I can't reproduce this. There is a known problem with SSL and PHP's fopen, fgets, etc. because some servers close the SSL connection badly and it causes PHP to omit such error message. This is not going to be fixed in PHP (because it is not an error in PHP), so we have to deal with it.

I assume this is the problem you are having although I have not been able to reproduce it (connecting to the same servers you did).

If this is the case, this is one error you can ignore - in fact, the only way to avoid it is to silence it, which we can consider doing, but this is a bit off the Framework's standards so I'll have to discuss this with some people first.

I'll open a thread in fw-webservices@lists.zend.com about this, you're welcome to contribute if you have any opinions.

I've committed r. 4797 that is suppose to silence these errors. Please test again and let me know as I personally have no way to reproduce this.

Thanks!

yes, error is now gone.. thanks!

Silenced warnings. Solution might not be optimal, currently in discussion in fw-webservices
