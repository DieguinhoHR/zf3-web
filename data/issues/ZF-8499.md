ZF-8499: Add a getView method to Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer

### Description

Since most classes in Zend Framework don't expose many public properties, I propose that a getView() method is added to gain access to the view on Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer.

I've noticed many people asking how to access the view within the ViewRenderer helper and obviously, many of them don't look at the properties because most properties in the API are protected.
