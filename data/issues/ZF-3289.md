### Description

Some LDAP servers do not use SSL but TLS to handle data encryption. Unfortunately Zend\_Ldap does not support the start\_tls option.

To be able to include a new option UseTls with which we can enable this option. we make the following changes: To preserve the line numbers I have listed the fixes from bottom to start

In the connect method on line 602 we insert the following code in the if loop where we set the version 3 and opt\_referrals:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->_getUseTls()) {
        if (!@ldap_start_tls($resource)) {
              require_once 'Zend/Ldap/Exception.php';
              throw new Zend_Ldap_Exception($resource, "failed to set TLS: $host:$port");
        }
    }


And on line 251 we add the following method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * @return boolean The default TLS encrypted transport control
    */
    protected function _getUseTls()
    {
        return $this->_options['useTls'];
    }


and on line 162 we add in the permittedOptions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'useTls'                    => null,


The above code has been tested by me on our company LDAP which uses TLS but not SSL.

Fixed in r10171.

Although the option is called userStartTls because it's really a change in protocol sequence where TLS and SSL are otherwise the same thing. Meaning TLS is SSL version 2. So in _theory_ TLS could be used on port 636 or a "start tls" style protocol could be used with SSLv1.
