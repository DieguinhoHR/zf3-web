### Description

Hi,

When working with huge forms sometime the code tends to become hard to maintain due to fact the form implementation (Zend\_Form subcless) is becoming huge as well. So is more easier to have the elements of the form defined into a separated file.

If using subforms is quite easy, you subclass Zend\_Form\_Subform and add all the elements to subforms. So maintaining the form elements is much easier having the form parts split into different files (subforms classes).

But if needing Display Groups this is not possible as far as i know.

For the sake of easier to work with forms would be good to have addDisplayGroup accepting a Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup and the displaygroup elements to be auto-added to the form.
