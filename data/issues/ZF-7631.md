No they're not. You should look which sort of failure is returned.

In the above case you get "Invalid type given, value should be float, string, or integer".

I agree that Arrays are missing. But a object can never be empty. To check a object for emptyness is quite useless and in my eyes a failure. Same for ressources.

About objects:

What if i have such code:

$value = ($\_POST['value']) ? new Zend\_Date($\_POST['value']) : null;

And im checking: Zend\_Validate::is($value,'NotEmpty')

I know that i can make a different solution but - as above - i don't know what's the type of $value - i just wan't to check if it's "NotEmpty".

As You said the objects are never empty so it could bo something like: if(is\_object($value)) return true;

Fixed...

Allowed arrays. Objects and Ressources are disallowed.
