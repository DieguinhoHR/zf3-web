ZF-51: Missing error handling in \_connect() (TRAC#74)
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-20T01:04:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:27.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.4 (29/Jun/06)

### Description

File : Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract.php Function: protected function \_connect() Line : 78 $this->\_connection = new PDO(

 
        $this->_dsn(), $this->_config['username'], $this->_config['password'] );


If the connection fails due to uncaught exception, it would dump a plethora of info (as per the docs) onto the client browser including the connection details such as userid/password... (and what not?) for the world wild web to see.

Reference: [http://us2.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo.php#pdo.connections)

try {

 
        $dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', $user, $pass); foreach ($dbh->query('SELECT * from FOO') as $row) {
    
            print_r($row);
    
        } $dbh = null; } catch (PDOException $e) { print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>"; die(); }

Here is a patch to wrap the PDO connection in a try / catch.

New patch which removed the need for exit;

Personally, I would like to see you catch the PDOException and throw a Zend\_Db\_Exception. I would also pick out some of the most useful, common errors from using PDO errors via the errorCode, then put the text of those errors (or nicely re-written error) in as the string of the Zend\_Db\_Exception.

Basically Zend\_Db\_Exception needs to be a pretty interface to all db exceptions, with the added ability to be able to drill down into the Exception thrown by the internal Adapter. This means adding 2 methods, perhaps getAdapterMessage() & getAdapterCode() to be able to get the exact error code from the given internal adapter.

my 2 cents.

Add a try / catch and throw a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception on failure
