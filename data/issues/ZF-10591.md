### Description

The call to load the Wurfl application class will fail if the configuration option "wurfl\_lib\_dir" does not contain a trailing forward slash. To fix, on line 77 and 73 make the following change require\_once ($config['wurfl\_lib\_dir'] . DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR . 'Application.php');

The documentation has already been updated to indicate the trailing slash is necessary. Since we pass these options directly to Wurfl without sanitization, the ball is in the Wurfl API's court to properly normalize them.

Documentation is updated, but not yet deployed to site.

This issue is in the Zend\_Http\_UserAgent\_Features\_Adapter\_WurflApi class. I neglected to mention that.

Removing fix version. Issues marked as "won't fix" don't need a fix version -- it makes them appear in the JIRA changelog and/or roadmap.
