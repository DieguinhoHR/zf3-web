### Description

The Flickr API method flickr.groups.pools.getPhotos allows to grab photos from group pools and optionally filter by a tag. I've extended the Zend\_Service\_Flickr class for my own use and would love for it to be part of the official release. Below is proposed new function. The \_validateGroupPoolGetPhotos() method is identical to the original \_validateUserSearch() short of the addition of 'tags' as a valid option.

I'm not sure the method names are optimal but it was the best I could come up with :/ If I'm making mistakes please bear with me, it's my first post as a contributor.

[UPDATE] Attached suggested improvement as a patch file

Patch/diff file for new groupPoolGetPhotos() method

Looks good to me, thanks for providing this patch! :) Would you be interested in contributing this, accompanying unit tests and documentation?

Tiny thing: I did notice that the $query parameter can be array|string, not just string.

I would be happy to write the accompanying test and doc. Good find, an array is not a valid input for this method.

Not sure if the unit tests should be included in the same patch file, but here goes.

Been having a few issues with my PHPUnit not working with xdebug enabled on my Mac/Leopard install.

I am not sure the testGroupPoolGetPhotosBasic() test is needed - it is basically a copy of the testTagSearchBasic(). The needed files in the \_files dir seems to be omitted by svn in generating the diff?

The array bug found by Darby has been fixed.

Could someone please review the patch and check if all is well.

I'm a fool, forgetting to add the new test files. They are included in the latest diff file.

Attaching a new diff file with documentation added. Also corrected a missing valid option user\_id.

What is the next step from here?

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-03-04T13:57:20.000+0000

I think the next step is to commit the changes to the SVN repository. I'll send your SVN credentials in an e-mail shortly. :)

Thank you, Darby. Should I patch and commit against HEAD or some specific revision?

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-03-10T08:13:58.000+0000

You should commit your changes to [the HEAD of trunk](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk).

Resolved in [SVN 8733-8734](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=8734)

If you committed a patch for this issue, added unit tests and probably added some docu which describe it,

then you should close this issue, as "resolved" ;-)

Closed after commit

Did this make it in to 1.5.0?

 

 

Posted by Joakim Nygård (jokke) on 2008-03-25T16:47:18.000+0000

It is not included in 1.5.0.

Zend\_Service\_Flickr seems to be at revision 8064 in 1.5.0 whereas latest commit related to this issue is revision 8733 (and 8886 for accompanying tests).

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-04-02T09:01:45.000+0000

Merging revisions 8733 and 8734 to the release-1.5 branch would get these features into the next mini release (1.5.2), or as they are new features, they could wait for next minor release (1.6.0).

 

 

Posted by Joakim Nygård (jokke) on 2008-05-09T07:40:08.000+0000

Merged to release-1.5 branch in r9433

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-09-02T10:39:38.000+0000

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
