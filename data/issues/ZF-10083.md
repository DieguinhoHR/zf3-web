### Description

Hello,

Apologies if this is not a bug but my mistake:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    echo $date->getYear();
    //date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Berlin')
    //resources.locale.default = "de_DE"


gets me:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    01.01.2010 01:00:00


only:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->setTimezone('Europe/London');
    echo $date->getYear()


gets me the correct hour:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    01.01.2010 00:00:00


Also, an explicit

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $loc = new Zend_Locale();
    $loc->setLocale('de_DE');
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->setTimezone('Europe/Berlin');
    echo $date->getYear();


makes it an hour later :(

Is this a bug?

When you look at the second and the third example, and you say that they produce different output, then we can assume the your locale is not set correct. But you did not assign this locale to the date, so there is no relation firsthand.

So the generic question for you is: Where is the difference for those 2 codeblocks (timezone, timestamp, cache, locale, browser, cli). When you find the difference then you will also find the cause of the problem.

Closing as non-reproduceable as there was no further response from the reporter since several weeks
