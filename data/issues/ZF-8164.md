ZF-8164: Zend\_Console\_Getopt does not allow hyphens in "word" options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-27T20:53:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:01.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Using the "word" option type, eg

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $opts = new Zend_Console_Getopt(array(
        'foo|f=w' => 'Foo option, with required "word" parameter'
    ));


does not allow a hyphen to be present, eg

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    command --foo some-value-with-hyphens


This is due to the preg\_match check in Zend\_Console\_Getopt::\_checkParameterType() that checks for "/\\W/" (anything other than letters, numbers and underscore) characters.

According to the documentation, the "w" flag should allow bq. "=w" for a word parameter (a string containing no whitespace)
