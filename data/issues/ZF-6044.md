### Description

Hello,

I think it would be really useful to add a method to be able to insert Javascript code in the Dojo onLoad() function but before any other onLoad() code, including the code automatically inserted by Zend to initialize the dijits.

The existing prependOnLoad() or addOnLoad() methods always put the Javascript code after the dijits initialization. Therefore, there is no way to add some Javascript code at the very first of onLoad() stack.

Regards, Stéphane Legrand.
