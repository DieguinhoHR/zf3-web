ZF-10350: Control sort order for auto addTranslation via options scan by filename

### Description

Using the Zend\_Translate\_Adapter with scanning by LOCALE\_FILENAME behaves different on multiple plattforms.

I used the autoload to have a filstructure like /languages/de/01\_default.ini /languages/de/02\_customer.ini /languages/en/01\_default.ini /languages/en/02\_customer.ini

that works well on window, but fails on linux, because inside addTranslation the used RecursiveDirectoryIterator returns files in unspecified order (as specified).

The autoloading feature would be very helpful to split default translations and customer specific overides of former entries

ex. 01\_default.ini -> Copyright="No Copyright because OpenSource" 02\_customer.ini -> Copyright="Copyright 2010 by Company"

The Solution would be first reading all scaned translation files into an array and after RecursiveDirectoryProcessing sorting that array by filename and calling addTranslationData.

I think, this would be a great benefit for the whole Component.

Best wishes, Holger

Closing as won't fix.

You can already scan for named files and concat multiple instances to one instance.
