ZF-10377: Zend\_Nav should allow for more acl checks than Zend\_acl
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently the interface Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Helper defines the method setAcl as follows: public function setAcl(Zend\_Acl $acl = null);

Imho that should be changed to a generic callback, in order to allow people to specify alternate sources of authorization like their own service layer.
