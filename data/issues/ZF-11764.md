### Description

If you call Zend\_Db\_Select->union() with an array of Zend\_Db\_Select objects, any bind variables from those objects will not be copied over to the first select, resulting in an error when the union is executed. Tested in both release and in Subversion (r24460).

p.s. could someone give me file attachment permissions? It does not seem I am able to attach files to tickets.

I've reviewed your patch, and everything seems A-OK to me. The test you have provided passes, as does the whole Zend\_Db test suite (excluding the normal fails I get back from the sqlite portion of Zend\_Db on my system).
