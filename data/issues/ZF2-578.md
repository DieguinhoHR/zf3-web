### Description

In Zend/Mvc/Service/ServiceListenerFactory.php :

3 factories :

'factories' => array( 'ConsoleRouter' => 'Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory', 'HttpRouter' => 'Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory', 'Router' => 'Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory', ),

I think :

> we must mark "ConsoleRouter" and "HttpRouter" like alias or we must mark "ConsoleRouter" like invokable with "Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack" and "HttpRouter" with "Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Console\\SimpleRouteStack" because with this version (2.0.0), if i get "ConsoleRouter" with ServiceManager, i am not sure i will have a instance of the console router, because "Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\RouterFactory" choose automatically !

What is your feedback ?
