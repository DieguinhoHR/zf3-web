Alex, I can't verify this and related. clear should always be false as it's not set on true or 1. Do you have the same issue also when testing this testbed alone ? Or only when doing a AllTests ?

I expect that the cache or registry is set but not by this testbed and used.

Yeah, all Zend\_Translate tests pass correctly if they runs separately.

Probably fixed with r11751
