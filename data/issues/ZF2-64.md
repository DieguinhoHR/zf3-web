### Description

Now we have possibility to attach additional configuration files to main application, for example by next lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    config = APPLICATION_PATH "/configs/local.ini"


But one main strangeness that configuration items from additional config not overwriting main application config item. Why? Be better versa.

I have found ZF-6811, where was made this strangeness. I think better if next attached config should overwrite previous, it's logical right? And should be indifferent which type of config files used for main and additional configurations.
