### Description

When you create a form element from .ini file, and add a StringLength validator to your element with a .max option but without .min option, then .max is wrongly interpreted as .min.

_Example_:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    user_details.elements.firstname.options.validators.strlen.validator = "StringLength"
    user_details.elements.firstname.options.validators.strlen.options.max = "30"

Let's say I input "foo" as firstname _Actual result_:{quote} - form does not validate - following error message is displayed: 'foo' is less than 30 characters long {quote} _Expected result_:{quote} - form should validate - no error should be displayed {quote} NOTE: this bug may impact other validators as well. Problem comes from Zend\_Form\_Element::\_loadValidator() ``` $validator['options'] is passed to constructor without taking into consideration options name<

_Temporary workaround_: - always specify a min length as well (set it to 0)
