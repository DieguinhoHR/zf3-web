ZF-4654: Accessing registry as an object not working in minimal framework library

### Description

Zend\_Registry functionality is partly broken in the _minimal_ framework library. "It looks like ::get and ::set aren't pulling and adding to the same store as ->name" For instance:

$foo = Zend\_Registry::getInstance(); $foo->bar = "baz";

Does not work, the variables or objects being set to the registry this way are not saved. That while using ::set does work: Zend\_Registry::set('bar', "baz");

I came across this problem with the ZF Quickstart Guide and the minimal framework distribution (ZendFramework-1.6.1-minimal.zip): [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table) The objects set to the registry there were not accessible elsewhere in the application!

[16:39] isul: report and issue :) framework.zend.com/issues [16:40] really bizarre - I think it's because Zend\_Registry doesn't implement PHP's magic functions \_\_set / \_\_get [16:40] so doing $reg->foo = "bar" isn't placing the var in the same store as ::get and ::set [16:41] breakerfall: not \_\_set/\_\_get ? [16:42] jfalvarez, it doesn't use the magic functions I don't think, but instead, it's extending the SPL array object [16:42] weird though, I would have thought mixing and matching would work

Well, reading the reference guide, seems like is not a bug: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.registry.html#zend.registry.using.array-object) so the QuickStart needs to be fixed, [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-configuration-and-registry) adding Zend\_Registry::setInstance() code portion to the "REGISTRY" code sample.

$registry = new Zend\_Registry(array(), ArrayObject::ARRAY\_AS\_PROPS) Zend\_Registry::setInstance($registry);

We now construct an ArrayObject with default to ARRAY\_AS\_PROPS r12065 is the fix
