### Description

The Zend\_Cache\_Core::save() function automatically serializes the data (or throws an Exception...) that isn't instance of string. It's a bug because there is a backend called Memcached that has build-in JSON serializer for non-string values so there is no way to use it in my custom Zend Cache Backend.

Is this still true if you set the "automatic\_serialization" frontend option to a boolean false?

This won't be fixed in ZF1. -> fixed in ZF2-133
