### Description

It will resource plugin that helps automate Dojo bootstraping to ZF application.

For integrating Dojo only need it add to application.ini (or other config):

resources.dojo.djConfig.isDebug = 1 resources.dojo.djConfig.parseOnLoad = 1 resources.dojo.cdnVersion = "1.3.2" resources.dojo.localPath = "/js/dojo-toolkit/dojo/dojo.js" resources.dojo.requireModule[] = "dojo.io.script" resources.dojo.requireModule[] = "dojo.fx" ... and other settings available for setting in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container

Realisation of resource plugin will be much ease with setOptions method that proxies values to setters of container

Matthew; I just assigned this issue to me so I can do it this weekend. After that I'll ask you for review (assuming you even want it in ZF).

Dolf -- sure. Note that this issue is dependent on ZF-7938 -- completing that makes this issue trivial to accomodate.

Dolf, we discuss this in mail list [http://nabble.com/Dojo-proposal%3A-What-do-you-thiâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Dojo-proposal%3A-What-do-you-think-about-proposal-Zend_Application_Resource_Dojo--td25548271.html#a25548271)

1. In Zend/Application/Resource/Dojo.php on 62 line you call Zend\_Dojo but dint require\_once 'Zend/Dojo.php'. Is it normally for Zend\_Application\_Resource\_\* classes?
2. What about useProgrammatic option? I wrote about it in #ZF-7939.

Georgy: yes -- since autoloading is in play whenever you use Zend\_Application, there's no need for the various Zend\_Application\_\* classes to have require\_once statements on their dependencies.

RE: useProgrammatic option -- yes, if it's not available via the resource, it should be. Dolf -- have you addressed this?

Dolf,

in DojoTest.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!defined('PHPUnit_MAIN_METHOD')) {
        define('PHPUnit_MAIN_METHOD', 'Zend_Application_Resource_LayoutTest::main');
    }
    ...
    if (PHPUnit_MAIN_METHOD == 'Zend_Application_Resource_LayoutTest::main') {
        Zend_Application_Resource_LayoutTest::main();
    }


Are you realy shure that you testing Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Dojo ? :)

Guess I copy/pasted just a bit too much. Thank you for reporting, will do within 24 hours, I think.

Dolf, in the end of a file even now there is a code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (PHPUnit_MAIN_METHOD == 'Zend_Application_Resource_LayoutTest::main') {
        Zend_Application_Resource_LayoutTest::main();
    }
