ZF-9316: ease change of result class

### Description

With current version of ZF (1.10.2), it is very hard (not to say impossible) to make Zend\_Rest\_Client use a result class other than Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result.

In my case, I only need to customize Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result => I subclass it, but I am not able to make Zend\_Rest\_Client use this class.

It would be a great increase in flexibility if result-classname was no longer hardcoded, for example storing name of result-class into a property of Zend\_Rest\_Client so that it could be easily changed.

Culprit seems to be this line (from Zend\_Rest\_Client.php):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __call($method, $args)
        {
            [...]
            return new Zend_Rest_Client_Result($response->getBody());
        }
