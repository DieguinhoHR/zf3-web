### Description

_Summary:_ In Zend\_Gdata\_CalendarEventTest, there are two typos that need to be fixed: \* neweventFeed -> newEventFeed \* Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_eventFeed -> Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventFeed

These don't have any side effects because they are used consistently and PHP doesn't treat class names as case sensitive, but they should still be fixed for the sake of consistency.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r5118. Affects 1.0.0 RC2.

_Notes:_ This has been fixed in my build and a patch has been sent to rboyd for review.
