### Description

Look at this page: [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)

To install the Sqlite database the reader is told to run this script:

% php scripts/load.sqlite.php

It executes as expected an creates the defined db scheme. But the INSERT statements are NOT executed because of a missing argument like this:

% php scripts/load.sqlite.php INSERT

The script is not spellchecking the parameter, it only checks its existence.

Please update this instrucction. Thanks
