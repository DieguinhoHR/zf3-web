### Description

Hello,

For code generated by ZF on form rendering is not compliant with xhtml strict.

Sample:

 
=

<

form enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="#" method="post" class="frm">

<

dl class="zend\_form">

 
=

<

fieldset id="general1">

 Start \#

name
====




This fails in couple of places, starting on fieldset side:

Line 52, Column 23: document type does not allow element "fieldset" here; assuming missing "dd" start-tag .

Zend\_Form does not use a fieldset decorator by default. If you wish to do so, you need to order your decorators appropriately.
