ZF-5781: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action will only render inside a Layout, not inside a View

### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action will only render inside my layout file, and not inside my view templates. I have specified all parameters, including the module name. Additionally, while the layout it returns the correct content, the view it returns nothing, AND there are no errors.

I have read all tickets related to Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action, and none appear to be related. The only one that seemed close was <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5518> It had two "fix files" attached, so I tried them, but the issue persisted.
