### Description

Zend\_Crypt fails when specifying an MD2 algorithm in the constructor on up-to-date versions of OpenSSL as the OPENSSL\_ALGO\_MD2 constant no longer exists for security reasons. Should support for MD2 be removed altogether or does it need to stay for compatibility with older implementations of SSL?

There is already an issue created for this relating to ZF1:
