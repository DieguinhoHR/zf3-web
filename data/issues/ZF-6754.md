ZF-6754: Not possible to submit forms containing Dojo Editor using Xhr due to difficult-to-work-with implementation

### Description

I believe it's basically impossible to submit ZF-generate forms containing the rich-text editor dijit.Editor because of the way the update of the hidden form field is implemented in ZF.

The problem arises because of Javascript code in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor::\_createEditorOnSubmit(), which binds the value update of the hidden field to the 'submit' event of the form. However, any developer code which submits the form via xhr (or does anything else, for that matter) is also very likely to connect to this event. Since the order of execution of multiple functions connected by dojo.connect to the same event is undefined, it is impossible to guarantee that the hidden form field is updated before any developer code runs (in my case, the form was being submitted via xhr before the ZF update code had run, meaning the text typed into the editor never reached the server).

Unless ZF is going to maintain their own patches & extensions to dijit.Editor (which would allow you to guarantee that the hidden field update runs before any connected events), there seems no way around this.

However, I think a good & trivial improvement would be to bind the update code to the onNormalizedDisplayChanged event of the editor; this will lead to many more updates of the hidden field, but the overhead is low and I don't see it as a genuine issue. I think it unlikely that developers will write code which depends on the value of the hidden field being set and which connects to the onNormalizedDisplayChanged event, and so, while the issue is not solved, it will be avoided for 99% of your users.

The improvement involves altering Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor::\_createEditorOnSubmit to be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
       protected function _createEditorOnSubmit($hiddenId, $editorId)
        {
            $this->dojo->onLoadCaptureStart();
            echo <<dojo->onLoadCaptureEnd();
        }

The proposed fix doesn't work for me - ZF 1.10 & Dojo 1.4.0

(I haven't figured out yet whats not working...)
