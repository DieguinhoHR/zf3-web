### Description

<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa224033>(SQL.80).aspx

Microsoft SQL Server does support ANSI standard delimited identifiers. Use double-quotes for identifier delimiters.

This is the behavior to use when the mode QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER is ON. This mode is on by default in the OLEDB, ODBC, and DBLIB interfaces.

Reopening. We need to set QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER ON after connecting to MS SQL Server, because DB-LIB does not set it by default.

Set fix version to 0.9.2.

Try again to set version.

Fixed. MS SQL Server adapter sets QUOTED\_IDENTIFIER ON by default as of revision 4877.
