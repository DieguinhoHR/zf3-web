### Description

I was trying to prepare some forms using HorizontalSlider components. What I encountered was that whatever labels I put in the addElement function of the form, I would always get three labels: 0%, 50%, 100% displayed.

My code is simple: {quote} $form->addElement('HorizontalSlider', 'slide1', array( 'label' => '1. Jestem zadowolony z przebiegu negocjacji.', 'minimum' => 1, 'maximum' => 3, 'discreteValues' => 3, 'showButtons' => false, 'style' => 'width: 450px;', 'topDecorationDijit' => 'HorizontalRuleLabels', 'topDecorationLabels' => array(' ', '20', '30'), 'topDecorationParams' => array('style' => 'padding-top: 5px; height: 20px;'), )) {quote}

But actually the issue is not with the code itself, as I have tried numerous examples from reference guide and I always got the same result.

I've played a bit into the code rendered by ZF, and what I found was as follows.

1) Framework generates a

<

div> for a decorator container followed by ol list of labels. The problem is that the ol is included inside the div. See the HTML below: {quote}

 \*\* 1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
 
 \*{color:red}

{color}\* {quote} I've played a bit with the HTML and got a better results when I moved the 

 tag before the

<

ol> one, like that: {quote}

<

div id="horizontal-slider" onChange="..." ... dojoType="dijit.form.HorizontalSlider"> \*

{color:red}

{color}\*

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

{quote}

2) However, that didn't solve the whole issue. With manually modified HTML I finally got my very own labels above the slider. But at the same time, I got those 0,50,100% overlayed. So I kept on investigating the problem and found out that ZF assigns the dojoType=dijit.form.HorizontalRuleLabels property to both div and ol tags. Removing dojoType from div solved the case.

{quote}

<

div id="horizontal-slider" onChange="..." ... dojoType="dijit.form.HorizontalSlider"> \*

{color:red}

{color}\*

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

{quote}

I tried those with both programmatic and declarative ussage of Dojo. Described solutions works in both cases. I think that Dojo looks for the list of labels after the container div. At least this is what I found here:

[http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/â€¦](http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-2-dijit/form-validation-specialized-input/slider)

In the second example on that page the only case when dojoType is set to div is when it is the HorizontalRule type. Then it includes both rule lines and labels 0,50,100%. In two other cases there is no dojoType in div tag.

Good luck with that bug. Regards, Rafal
