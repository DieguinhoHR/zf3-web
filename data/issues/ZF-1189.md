### Description

While checking email scores coming through spamassassin I noticed that the 'BAD\_ENC\_HEADER' rule was being triggered - which refers to whitespace in mime encoded headers a violation of rfc 2047.

I added another str\_replace line and the error went away and the spamassassin points assigned to the email dropped almost 2 points.

patch is below. likely there is a more elegant way to do it.

 
         $out = '';
         $str = str_replace('=', '=3D', $str);


+ $str = str\_replace(' ', '=20', $str); $str = str\_replace(self::$qpKeys, self::$qpReplaceValues, $str);

 
         // Split encoded text into separate lines

Thanks for your report. The bug wasn't in encodeQuotedPrintable as it doesn't return encoded-words, but in Zend\_Mail::\_encodeHeader(). Spaces are now encoded as well.
