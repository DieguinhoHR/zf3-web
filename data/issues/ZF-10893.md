### Description

Hello ;

It's my first report here so on, please don't be annoyed if I'm wrong in the way to process...

I was extended the _Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt_ filter to be able to define my own padding method (padding space method to be compatible with my perl script (Perl Crypt-CBC - Algorithm blowfish).

I work with a fixed key that I set like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = Zend_Registry::get('config');
    $filter = new iMSCP_Filter_Encrypt_Mcrypt($config->imscp_key);
    ...


The problem is that I must also redefine the _Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_initCipher()_ method in my class since it's currently buggy. Indeed, when we sets our own key, the Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_initCipher() bypass it with salt in some case.

The current code in the parent methods is like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _initCipher($cipher)
        {
            $key = $this->_encryption['key'];
    
            $keysizes = mcrypt_enc_get_supported_key_sizes($cipher);
    
            if (empty($keysizes) || ($this->_encryption['salt'] == true)) {
                $this->_srand();
                $keysize = mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher);
                $key     = substr(md5($key), 0, $keysize);
            } else if (!in_array(strlen($key), $keysizes)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
    
        ....
    }


Like you can see here, we get the supported key sizes of the opened algorithm. In my case, it's the _Blowfish_ algorithm in _CBC_ mode, and the value returned by the mcrypt\_enc\_get\_supported\_key\_sizes() function is an empty array. According the documentation related to this function, when an empty array is returned, all keysizes between 1 and the value returned by the _mcrypt\_enc\_get\_key\_size()_ are supported by the algorithm. My own key size is 32. The problem is that currently, when we receive an empty array, the Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_initCipher() method nypass the key with salt.

For now, I've resolved this issue by redefining this method in my subclass but I think that should be fixed in _Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_initCipher()_ directly.

My (ugly) modified version of this methods is like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Initialises the cipher with the set key
         *
         * @param  resource $cipher
         * @throws
         * @return resource
         */
        protected function _initCipher($cipher)
        {
            $key = $this->_encryption['key'];
    
            $keysizes = mcrypt_enc_get_supported_key_sizes($cipher);
    
    /* my replacement code  - start */
            if(empty($keysizes)) { // All value between 1 and mcrypt_enc_get_key_size() are supported
                $keysize = mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher);
            if($this->_encryption['salt'] == true) {
                $this->_srand();
                $key = substr(md5($key), 0, $keysize);
            } elseif(strlen($key) > $keysize || strlen($key) < 1) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
            } else if (!in_array(strlen($key), $keysizes)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
    /* my replacement code  - end */
    
    /* old zend code  - start */
    
            if (empty($keysizes) || ($this->_encryption['salt'] == true)) {
                $this->_srand();
                $keysize = mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher);
                $key     = substr(md5($key), 0, $keysize);
            } else if (!in_array(strlen($key), $keysizes)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
    /* old zend code  - end */
    
            $result = mcrypt_generic_init($cipher, $key, $this->_encryption['vector']);
            if ($result < 0) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('Mcrypt could not be initialize with the given setting');
            }
    
            return $this;
        }


Thanks for any feedback about this issue.

_Note:_ Sorry for my poor English, I'm french.

The implementation from ZF will not be changed. The reason is that ZF's implementation is failure-save according to key sizes which extend the given maximum value.

Your code throws an exception when the key extends the wished size which is not necessary as the key is stripped to the maximum value (as recommended).

When you want to extend an existing class you should simply extend regarding to your needs and keep calling the rest when it fits. Your code can be reduced to 5 lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _initCipher($cipher)
    {
        if(empty(mcrypt_enc_get_supported_key_sizes($cipher))) {
            if(strlen($this->_encryption['key']) > mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher) || strlen($this->_encryption['key']) < 1) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
        }
    
        return parent::_initCipher($cipher);
    }

Closing as non-issue.

God... I've you tested before answer ? I'll try to explain better with code:

1. from my perl script, I generate the key and initialization vector by calling the following script:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    #!/user/bin/perl
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Crypt::CBC;
    use Data::Dumper;
    
    open(F, '>', 'imscp-keys') or die("Error: Can't open file 'imscp-keys' for writing: $!");
    
    print F Data::Dumper->Dump(
        [Crypt::CBC->random_bytes(32), Crypt::CBC->random_bytes(8)], [qw(key iv)]
    );
    
    close F;
    
    0;


After generation, the imscp-keys file contain the following content:

example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $key = 'rª\\|ðzµâþxRºöÊEÞÛÉigæ';
    $iv = 'uÆè6ç&';


After, that, I want use both key and initialization vector with Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcryp.

To resume, I want be able to do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    // Load local configuration file
    require_once 'Zend/Config/Ini.php';
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini(APPLICATION_PATH . DS . 'configs' . DS . 'imscp.ini', 'frontend', true);
    
    // Load system configuration file
    require_once 'Zend/Config/Xml.php';
    $sysCfg = new Zend_Config_Xml($sysCfgFile);
    
    // Load imscp key and initialization vector
    if(($keysFile = file_get_contents($configDir . DS . 'common' . DS . 'imscp-keys')) && eval($keysFile) !== false) {
        $config->key = $key;
        $config->iv = $iv;
    } else {
        throw new Zend_Exception('Unable to reach or evaluate the imscp-keys file!');
    }
    
    Zend_Registry::set('config', $config);
    
    // In another file
    $config = Zend_Registry::get('config');
    
    $filter = new iMSCP_Filter_Encrypt_Mcrypt($config);
    $password = $filter->decrypt($config->resources->db->params->password);


The problem here is that my key is not used like I provide it since the following method in Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Initialises the cipher with the set key
         *
         * @param  resource $cipher
         * @throws
         * @return resource
         */
        protected function _initCipher($cipher)
        {
            $key = $this->_encryption['key'];
    
            $keysizes = mcrypt_enc_get_supported_key_sizes($cipher);
            if (empty($keysizes) || ($this->_encryption['salt'] == true)) {
                $this->_srand();
                $keysize = mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher);
                $key     = substr(md5($key), 0, $keysize);
            } else if (!in_array(strlen($key), $keysizes)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
    
            $result = mcrypt_generic_init($cipher, $key, $this->_encryption['vector']);
            if ($result < 0) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('Mcrypt could not be initialize with the given setting');
            }
    
            return $this;
        }


change it. To resume, it's a bug since I cannot decrypt any password encrypted with my perl script and vice-versa (I cannot decrypt any password encrypted with my php script). It's simply due to the fact that Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt don't use my key like provided. Why this limitation ? Why you change my key ?

For the record, my original key is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(32) "r\|zxREɚig"


but the iMSCP\_Filter\_Encrypt\_Mcrypt::\_initCipher() method change it like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(32) "e8066f90e2a30c17d90510557da13c6c"


Of course, like my passwords where not been encrypted with the "e8066f90e2a30c17d90510557da13c6c" key, that don't work...

To finish, some words about your last sentence:

{quote}

When you want to extend an existing class you should simply extend regarding to your needs and keep calling the rest when it fits. Your code can be reduced to 5 lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _initCipher($cipher)
    {
        if(empty(mcrypt_enc_get_supported_key_sizes($cipher))) {
            if(strlen($this->_encryption['key']) > mcrypt_enc_get_key_size($cipher) || strlen($this->_encryption['key']) < 1) {
                require_once 'Zend/Filter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('The given key has a wrong size for the set algorithm');
            }
        }
    
        return parent::_initCipher($cipher);
    }


{quote}

I want not redefine this method to check my key length. I redefine it to avoid the problem described above (key not used like provided due to the following line: $key = substr(md5($key), 0, $keysize);
