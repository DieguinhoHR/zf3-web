Seems to be related to changes in Zend\_Uri\_Http in r. 5051

Fixed in r.5057.

Basically it looks like the test was trying to catch a Zend\_Http\_Client\_Exception when an invalid string URI was passed, but it looks like Zend\_Http\_Client was fixed to not throw another exception when a Zend\_Uri\_Exception is thrown (which makes allot of sense!)

The test was fixed to catch a Zend\_Uri\_Exception and not a Zend\_Http\_Client exception.
