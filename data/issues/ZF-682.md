### Description

Found by Andrew Yager and reported on the mailing list:

===========================================================================================================================

Should there be any difference in processing

$route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route("/", array("controller"=>"index", "action"=>"index"), $formats);

and

$route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_StaticRoute("/", array("controller"=>"index", "action"=>"index"), $formats);

I have found that the latter matches, where the former does not, and am wondering if that's a bug or intended behaviour.
