### Description

First: I tried to compile the manual on Windows with cygwin.

Ive got an error mentioned before ([http://nabble.com/Cygwin-DocBook-errors-to11812012â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Cygwin-DocBook-errors-to11812012s16154.html#a11816098)). It seems, that this

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
    /code>

will lead to this

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    


Ive simply tried to change the **V4.4** into **V4.5** in \_**temp\_manual.xml** and it worked. Ive dont tested, if this change will work for **manual.xml.in** too, but it strongly seems to.

It seems that you are using an outdated version. Or your tempfiles are not empty.

I tested with the actual release with german and english. There are no problems during the build process beside validation and linking errors, but these do not stop the build.

Maybe you have no internet connection or the false dtd version as written within the mail you attached. Or your script does not have writing permission to the directory it resists.

FYI: I am also using Cygwin on Windows but without problems... please write to the mailing list for problems on cygwin as this is no issue of ZF

No, the files were straight from the trunk and a clean checkout. As described there should be no problem......

The file looks as you wrote... it has to look like that. It could be that you have problems getting the oasis docbook as it's the actual most used docbook dtd. If you have no internet connection, oasis is unreachable or the server does not send you the file because of overload then you will have the problems you mentioned.

Once you've downloaded the file it works as it will then use your local copy.

Still: this is no problem of ZF... please contact the doc mailing list for informations.
