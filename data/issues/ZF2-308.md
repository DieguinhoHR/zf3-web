### Description

When an object is instantiated, if a static method exists that is injectable, it gets called by Zend\\Di.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class One {}
    class Two {
        public static $one = false;
        public static function setSomethingStatically(One $one)
        {
            static::$one = $one;
        }
    }
    $di = new \Zend\Di\Di();
    
    
    $di->instanceManager()
       ->addTypePreference('One', new One());
    
    $two = $di->get('Two');
    
    $two::$one !== false;
