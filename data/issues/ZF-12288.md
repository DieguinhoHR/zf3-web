### Description

sql = "SELECT `professional_notes`.`Id` FROM `professional_notes` WHERE (NoteContent = 'drefhtpsna8ma0JC0000008WKqSMAWJ001377 [Direct HR | Dummy Job Test For Track Job Note | Ningbo, Zhejiang, China] na8salesforcecoma0KC0000004O4abMACC079175 [Bob Luo | b.luo@directhr.de | +86 000 0000 0000]' ) LIMIT 1";

When I execute it via $db->query the browser leads to some interupted connection page, not throw any error.

I think that this issue cause by special characters in content of field 'NoteContent '. Because when I remove some characters, It execute success.

How resolved it?

I'm closing this for now as it is currently incomplete.

If you wish to re-open, please provide code to reproduce this issue, and change your error\_reporting settings to E\_ALL|E\_STRICT, and your error logging / display errors / log error settings so that you receive an actual error message from php (remember to check your logs, not just your browser).

Currently not enough information is provided to see whether this is a support request, or an actual bug, though it does look more like a support request.

If you need support, please use either the mailing list, or #zftalk on freenode irc.

Notes: the sql is execute successfully in mysql.

$db = new Notesubscirbe();

$sql = "SELECT `professional_notes`.`Id` FROM `professional_notes` WHERE(NoteContent = 'drefhtpsn8ama0JC0000008WKqSMAWJ001377 [Direct HR | Dummy Job Test For Track Job Note | Ningbo, Zhejiang, China] na8salesforcecoma0KC0000004O4abMACC079175 [Bob Luo | b.luo@directhr.de | +86 000 0000 0000]') LIMIT 1";

$db->getDefaultAdapter()->query($sql);
