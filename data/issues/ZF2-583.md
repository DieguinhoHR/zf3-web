### Description

I've written the following unit test in \\Zend\\Code\\Scanner\\DocBlockScannerTest to reproduce the problem, but no tags are returned by the scanner. My attempt to fix the bug and create a pull request failed, because I kept introducing other bugs.

public function testDocBlockScannerParsesTagsWithTabIndenting() { $docComment = <<getTags(); $this->assertCount(1, $tags); $this->assertEquals('@return', $tags[0]['name']); $this->assertEquals(' string', $tags[0]['value']); }
