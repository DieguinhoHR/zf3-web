### Description

The "to" field should not be mandatory when a cc or bcc is set. Currently, when not setting a "to" field, but providing a bcc or cc, an exception is thrown:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Exception' with message 'Missing To header' in /libs/Zend/Mail/Transport/Sendmail.php:133

As per RFC 2822, page 18: <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt>

That's only true for the sendmail transport. It uses the php function mail() and <http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php> doesn't say it's optional or how it behaves if it's an empty string.

It does say it must comply with RFC 2822 and I can only assume they mean address-list. As addr-spec, which is part of address-list has a literal @ the empty string would not be valid.

The SMTP transport does not have this problem.

Therefore RFC 2822 is not the problem here, but mail(), which does explicitly write a To header.
