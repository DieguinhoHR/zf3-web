### Description

I would like reopen <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11489>

you are right with mixing scripts, but all Latin-\* are **same** script and can be together. Latin-1 supplement + Latin Extended-A + Latin Extended-B are same script! Cyrillic is different script from Latin1.

See test case from previous ticket.
