ZF-3420: API Doc Links in Reference Guide

### Description

It would be a nice convenience addition to have a direct link to the API docs for the related package on chapter-specific pages in the reference guide, perhaps between the Prev/Next links in the header. So, for example, all Zend\_View-related reference guide pages would have a link to the Zend\_View package in the API docs. The framed interface generated by phpDocumentor may or may not preclude this.

I don't think that this makes sense...

We should add a link from the api doc to the manual, maybe forcing this through the coding standard. But a backlink from the manual to the apidoc does not make sense in my eyes because not only developers are reading the manual. Also marketing guys for example.

My 2 cents...

It's more frequent that I'm reading a manual section that provides coverage of basic use and want to look at the full API specs, as opposed to looking at the API docs for a component and want to see examples of use. The former makes more sense to me than the latter.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.

I don't see how this would work. We only keep the latest version of the API docs on the site; the links would be to the wrong version as soon as the reference manual is no longer the latest version. Even if it is the latest version, the API docs on the site are currently from trunk. This has the potential to add a lot of confusion for a minor convenience.
