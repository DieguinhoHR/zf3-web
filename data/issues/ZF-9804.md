ZF-9804: Zend\_Mime\* throw Zend\_Mime\_Exception rather than Zend\_Exception

### Description

I have need of being able to catch mime component exceptions separately from other zend exceptions. Zend\_Mime\_Decode and Zend\_Mime\_Message both throw Zend\_Exception, which I think should throw Zend\_Mime\_Exception.

I'll include a patch with the changes.
