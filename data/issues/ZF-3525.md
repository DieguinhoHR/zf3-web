### Description

I think I found an error in "Zend/View/Helper/FormElement.php"

the following should be changed on line 159:

 
        // Remove attribs that might overwrite the other keys. We do this LAST 
        // because we needed the other attribs values earlier.


-foreach ($info as $key => $val) {- +foreach ($info['attribs'] as $key => $val) {+ if (isset($info['attribs'][$key])) { unset($info['attribs'][$key]); } }

After I gave it some more thought and understood the comment I realised that this is not a bug.

I think from the comment of Andreas, it is not issue.
