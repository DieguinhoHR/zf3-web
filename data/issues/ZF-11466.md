### Description

When creating controllers with:

zf create action

we can sometimes override existing controller (without any warning).

To override controller LoremController.php type the command:

zf create controller lorem

or

zf create controller

and then when prompted type:

lorem

The issue here is that it appears `zf create controller` checks to see if the controller exists before it's converted to canonical form.

Reproduced below against trunk:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [adam@zfdev zf]$ zf create project ZF-11466
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11466]$ zf create controller Test
    Creating a controller at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/application/controllers/TestController.php
    Creating an index action method in controller Test
    Creating a view script for the index action method at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/application/views/scripts/test/index.phtml
    Creating a controller test file at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/tests/application/controllers/TestControllerTest.php
    Updating project profile '/tmp/zf/ZF-11466/.zfproject.xml'
    
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11466]$ zf create controller Test
                              An Error Has Occurred
     This project already has a controller named Test
    
    Zend Framework Command Line Console Tool v1.11.0dev
    Details for action "Create" and provider "Controller"
      Controller
        zf create controller name index-action-included[=1] module
    
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11466]$ zf create controller test
    Note: The canonical controller name that is used with other providers is "Test"; not "test" as supplied
    Creating a controller at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/application/controllers/TestController.php
    Creating an index action method in controller Test
    Creating a view script for the index action method at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/application/views/scripts/test/index.phtml
    Creating a controller test file at /tmp/zf/ZF-11466/tests/application/controllers/TestControllerTest.php
    Updating project profile '/tmp/zf/ZF-11466/.zfproject.xml'


`zf create controller Test` run twice will trigger an error the second time, but running `zf create controller test` subsequent to that will overwrite the existing TestController, despite the fact that all three reference the same controller.
