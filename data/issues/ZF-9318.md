### Description

With current (v1.10.2) implementation of Zend\_Rest\_Client::restDelete(), you cannot add any query parameters to queried url.

For instance, if I want to delete item with id=1, I did not find how to end up with my-delete-url?id=1. This is very very very useful (not everybody use friendly urls / url-mapping|rewriting)

I slightly modified the function so that it behaves as restGet, restPost and restPut.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        /**
         * Performs an HTTP DELETE request to $path.
         *
         * @param string $path
         * @throws Zend_Http_Client_Exception
         * @return Zend_Http_Response
         */
        final public function restDelete($path)
        {
            $this->_prepareRest($path);
            return self::getHttpClient()->request('DELETE');
        }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Performs an HTTP DELETE request to $path.
         *
         * @param string $path
         * @param array  $query Array of GET parameters
         * @throws Zend_Http_Client_Exception
         * @return Zend_Http_Response
         */
        final public function restDelete($path, $query = null)
        {
            $this->_prepareRest($path);
        $client = self::getHttpClient();
        $client->setParameterGet($query);
            return $client->request('DELETE');
        }

diff file against v1.10.2 allowing restDelete() to accept query arguments

Note: current behaviour (not to provide arguments within queried url) seems to be inconsistent with current implementation of Zend\_Client\_Server.

When Zend\_Client\_Server is called through Zend\_Rest\_Client::restDelete() query, following error is returned: Unexpected error: No Method Specified.

It looks like Zend\_Client\_Server do expect ?method=xxx arg in queried url.

Proposed solution gets rid of this error.

I am currently fixing this along with three other issues about Zend\_Rest\_Client. However, I use a different approach. See patch.
