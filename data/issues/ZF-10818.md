### Description

According to the current documentation at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.cache.manager.html) (bottom) their is a Zend\_Cache\_Manager template named 'skeleton', which is a so called "NULL cache". This template no longer exists since version 1.10.8. This template was removed at commit: r22727 -> [http://framework.zend.com/code/revision.php/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/revision.php?rev=22727)

I don't understand why this 'skeleton' template was removed. I guess some people are using this template. Please make a note in the documentation, that the 'skeleton' template is no longer available.

I think but sensible assign again the template _skeleton_.

Greetings Ramon

the "skeleton" cache template was removed to only have pre-defined templates which are usable without the need of additional configuration. -> Before you got an exception on getting the skeleton cache or on getting all defined caches. (implemented in r22727)

I'll update the documentation and create a migration part to this the next few days.
