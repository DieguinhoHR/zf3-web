It would be nice if an exception was thrown if a file doesn't exist rather than just have a PHP warning.

I attempted a patch, but got this error: PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Controller\_Front' not found

Code on the line that the error shows is: $frontController = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance();
