ZF-8911: wddx\_serialize and utf-8 data will not work correctly
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-23T14:32:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-02T06:27:38.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - Next Major Release ()

### Description

The wddx\_serialize function always encodes to utf-8...even when the data is already utf-8. Therefore you must decode to iso-8859-1 before wddx\_serialize, or else your data gets "double" utf-8 encoded. This means wddx\_serialize can't really serialize utf-8 encoded strings. If this is a PHP bug I don't know...but ZF should be aware of this and maybe implement this workaround.

Try wddx\_serialize with a string in utf-8 encoding containing some special characters that are not in the standard english alphabet. The resulting wddx xml document will not be correct.

I tested it with the following test but it pass:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function testSerializeStringUtf8() {
            $value    = "\xce\x9e"; // Îž
            $expected = ''
                      . "\xce\x9e";
            $data = $this->_adapter->serialize($value);
            $this->assertEquals($expected, $data);
        }


Please tell me your php version. Can you create a test that failes please.

I tested a bit more and it seems that it works fine on PHP 5.2.9 but fails on PHP 5.2.6 However it's on two different servers, so it could still be other things than PHP. I can try to upgrade the server that runs 5.2.6 and see if resolves the issue.

I used the string "\\xc2\\xbf" to test with, it is a reverse questionmark.

it seems this is a bug in PHP that is already fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience. <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=46496>

Maybe a comment in the ZF sourcecode would be helpfull for people still running PHP versions having this bug.

Now I ran this test with different php version (5.2.4, 5.2.5, 5.2.6, 5.2.8). It fails on all php versions < 5.2.8 (I think it was fixed within 5.2.7 - but this version isn't available for download)

Within PHP-Docs I found the node: Note: If you want to serialize non-ASCII characters you have to convert your data to UTF-8 first (see utf8\_encode() and iconv()). But this doesn't work correctly for php < 5.2.7.

Now I close this issue because it can't fixed for php < 5.2.8 without. -> ZF 2.0 will need php 5.3.x as minimum version where the problem was fixed in ext/wddx.
