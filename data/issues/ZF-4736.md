### Description

The following (around line 337) from Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard should be refactored:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
    $loadFile    = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $this->classToFilename($className);
    $dir         = dirname($loadFile);
    $file        = basename($loadFile);
    
    try {
        Zend_Loader::loadFile($file, $dir, true);
    } catch (Zend_Exception $e) {
        require_once 'Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php';
        throw new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception('Cannot load controller class "' . $className . '" from file "' . $file . '" in directory "' . $dir . '"');
    }


The full file path is already known, so calling loadFile() is unnecessary overhead. Additionally, loadFile() does not throw an exception -- so there is no need to wrap it in a try/catch block. It would be sufficient to simply check that an include\_once statement does not return a false value.

Hello,

This issue should be reopened because the include\_once statement can generate a Warning if the file does not exists. It should be @include\_once or check with file\_exists

Thanks to fix this

Cheers,
