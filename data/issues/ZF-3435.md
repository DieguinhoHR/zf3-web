ZF-3435: Zend\_Validate\_Ip does not work as expected/documented
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

phpdoc of Zend\_Validate\_Ip::isValid() says "Returns true if and only if $value is a valid IP address". But in ZF Versions 1.5.2 and before strings like "192.168.10" or "192.168.10.10 asdf" are successfully validated, too. What in my opinion should not happen, especially the second case.

Seeing as how this bug could have _serious_ security issues for those who rely on the validator, and the relative ease it can be fixed with, I would like to attract a bit of attention to it.

Added unittest for this case with r12342. Issue already fixed.
