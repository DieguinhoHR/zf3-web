Zend\\For\\Factory::factory() works fine. The example is wrong. I'm changing this to a documentation issue.

Pull request submitted: [https://github.com/zendframework/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2-documentation/pull/233)

You can look in there to see how to properly use the factory.

This has nothing to do with the missing brackets mentioned in the pull request. The point is that the array provided to $factory->createForm() is wrong. Just copy and paste the example and you will get the exception as reported in the opening post.

After some testing and reading code in Zend\\Form\\Factory, I noticed that the methods Zend\\Form\\Factory::prepareAndInjectFieldsets() and Zend\\Form\\Factory::prepareAndInjectElements() are looking for keys with the name _flags_ or _spec_:

 
    <pre class="highlight">public function prepareAndInjectFieldsets($fieldsets, FieldsetInterface $masterFieldset, $method)
    {
        $fieldsets = $this->validateSpecification($fieldsets, $method);
    
        foreach ($fieldsets as $fieldsetSpecification) {
            $flags = isset($fieldsetSpecification['flags']) ? $fieldsetSpecification['flags'] : array();
            $spec  = isset($fieldsetSpecification['spec'])  ? $fieldsetSpecification['spec']  : array();
    
            $fieldset = $this->createFieldset($spec);
            $masterFieldset->add($fieldset, $flags);
        }
    }

 
    <pre class="highlight">protected function prepareAndInjectElements($elements, FieldsetInterface $fieldset, $method)
    {
        $elements = $this->validateSpecification($elements, $method);
    
        foreach ($elements as $elementSpecification) {
            $flags = isset($elementSpecification['flags']) ? $elementSpecification['flags'] : array();
            $spec  = isset($elementSpecification['spec'])  ? $elementSpecification['spec']  : array();
    
            $element = $this->createElement($spec);
            $fieldset->add($element, $flags);
        }
    }

To provide a working example in de documentation, the key _spec_ must be added to some arrays. Personally I do not find it logical to add an extra unnecessary array and prefer the array structure as currently mentioned in de docs. This said, i think this could be much more than just a documentation error.

Anyhow, this seems to work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$form = $factory->createForm(array(
        'hydrator'  => 'Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ArraySerializable',
        'name' => 'dummy',
        'fieldsets' => array(
            array(
                'spec' => array(
                    'name' => 'sender',
                    'elements' => array(
                        array(
                            'spec' => array(
                                'name' => 'name',
                                'options' => array(
                                    'label' => 'Your name',
                                    ),
                                'attributes' => array(
                                    'type'  => 'text'
                                ),
                            ),
                        ),
                    ),
                    'options' => array(
                        'label' => 'Sender details',
                    ),
                ),
            ), // a fieldset
        ),
    ));
