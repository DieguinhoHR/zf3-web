### Description

Zend\_Config and Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite play together for a long time now. But now and then a new Route object comes and this time I can't load them from config because of the key naming strictness in Zend\_Config. Basically, I need to load an array indexed numerically. But let's work on examples.

Standard Static Route instantiation and Zend\_Config ini representation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static(
        'forum', 
        array('controller' => 'forum', 'action' => 'list')
    );
    $router->addRoute('forums', $route);
    
    /* Zend_Config ini structure to achieve the same:
    
    routes.forums.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static"
    routes.forums.route = "forum"
    routes.forums.defaults.controller = "forum"
    routes.forums.defaults.action = "list" 
    */
    
    $router->addConfig($config, 'routes');


Now, there is this new type of Route - Regex Route - which needs a mapping of regex subpatterns (which are numerically indexed in PHP) to parameter names. Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex(
        'forum/(\d+)(?:p/(\d+))?', 
        array('controller' => 'forum', 'action' => 'threads', 'page' => '1'),
        array(1 => 'forum_id', 2 => 'page')
    );
    $router->addRoute('threads', $route);
    
    /* Zend_Config ini:
    
    routes.threads.type = "Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex"
    routes.threads.route = "forum/(\d+)(?:p/(\d+))?"
    routes.threads.defaults.controller = "forum"
    routes.threads.defaults.action = "threads"
    routes.threads.defaults.page = "1"
    routes.threads.map.1 = "forum_id"
    routes.threads.map.2 = "page"
    */
    
    $router->addConfig($config, 'routes');


As you probably see already, I can't do > routes.threads.map.1 = "forum\_id" < in Zend\_Config because of a very strict naming constraints. You keep the values in associative array so why can't you allow the same kind of keys that PHP allows you to use? Is this a necessity? Or maybe you could loosen it a bit, Rob?

Hi,

The trouble is that you couldn't use the object based interface to access the data.

i.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $map1 = $config->threads->map->1;


is invalid PHP which may be confusing.

Obviously

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $map = $config->threads->map->asArray();


should work fine though.

The question is whether we should break the predictably that you can always access a config key using the object notation. If so, then the fix is easy as it's a case of changing the validation regex.

Regards,

Rob...

Of course, a simple workaround is to prefix the keys, such as map\_1, so I'm tempted to say this isn't an issue.

However, since \_\_get() doesn't care whether the named value is a valid PHP identifier, maybe Zend\_Config shouldn't care, either. Syntax like the following would work if key validation were absent:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $config->threads->map->{1};


Maybe we should relieve Zend\_Config of the burden of checking the key's validity, since it appears to be more restrictive than what PHP already allows.

How about adding get and set methods which could coexist with object based interface? Like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $map1 = $config->threads->map->get("1");


It's a simple change that should deal with such edge cases but won't restrict the usage at the same time. And I guess everyone knows one can't use identifiers starting with numbers as it's a basic rule of php. Could we assume that someone choosing numeric indexes knows what he is doing and let him do it? Maybe with little heads-up in the manual.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public method get($name) {
       return $this->__get($name);
    }
    
    public method set($name, $value) {
       $this->__set($name, $value);
       return $this;
    }


Of course I only need asArray but it seems like a nice addition. What do you think?
