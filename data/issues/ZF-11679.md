### Description

While trying to run unit tests on a project which does not use the autoloader, we encountered a problem with Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Application claiming that some classes are undefined. Looking at the code, the class is defined as

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Application
        extends Zend_Tool_Project_Provider_Abstract
        implements Zend_Tool_Framework_Provider_Pretendable
    {


But there is no explicit require of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Abstract or Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Provider\_Pretendable
