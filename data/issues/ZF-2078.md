### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Ibm requires Zend\_Db\_Abstract\_Pdo\_Ibm\_Db2 and Zend\_Db\_Abstract\_Pdo\_Ibm\_Ids but they are not present in release.

 
    <pre class="highlight">27 /** Zend_Db_Abstract_Pdo_Ibm_Db2 */
    28 require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Ibm/Db2.php';
    29
    30 /** Zend_Db_Abstract_Pdo_Ibm_Ids */
    31 require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Ibm/Ids.php';

Zend Studio warned about that.

The missing folder and files were added to the release branch in the revision 7063.

They should now be available in the next mini-release.
