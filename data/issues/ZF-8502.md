Duplicates point 3 of ZF-8483. Seems not to be an issue

I don't think so.

For example user input a logical expression "a > b", but the result is "a b" after filter. Obviously, this is not the desired result.

On the other hand, Zend\_Filter\_StripTags and strip\_tags() have same name, bug their behavior have too much difference.

strip\_tags() keeps some angle brackets. pls see above description.
