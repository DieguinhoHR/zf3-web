### Description

Cannot believe it, first time I use Zend\_Dojo and I'm finding a major bug in the first 10 minutes (with another hour of following backtraces)... anyway, following problem:

When registering the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper path in the view, and trying to render a _usual_ form (which is a usual Zend\_Form without dijits nor dojo-enabled), Zend\_Form runs through its own decorators, of which one of the default decorators wants to call the "Form" view helper. As it tries so, a naming conflict hinders it from getting Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form, and Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Form is rendered instead.

This triggers Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit to be loaded by Zend\_View\_Abstract, which then calls the setView() method on this view helper, which finally enables Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_DojoContainer, without any need of it to be enabled. Additionally, it creates JavaScript code for the Dijit view helper, which is not required at all.

Generated JS code, which causes a complete DOM scan:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Just to make it even more interesting, it will also generate the following JavaScript error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Error: Could not load 'dijit.form.Form'; last tried '../dijit/form/Form.js'
    File: <a href="http://dasprids.local/media/js/dojo.js">http://dasprids.local/media/js/dojo.js</a>
    Line: 16


Using dojo.js from <http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.4.1/>

This is a known issue, and I plan to create a different decorator for this and the Textarea dijit as well so that naming collisions with these two won't occur. Unfortunately, I don't have a workaround possible for you to try in the immediate future.

Any chance to fix that in a mini release, or would that be considered a BC break which _has_ to wait for 2.0? Also, will there be any steps taken in 2.0 that those naming conflicts cannot occur anymore?

For those of you interested in a workaround:

Extend the Form-decorator in your application library, and set $\_helper = 'formForm'. Then extends the Form-view-helper in your application library as FormForm, and route the formForm() call to form(). This will avoid the naming conflict for now.
