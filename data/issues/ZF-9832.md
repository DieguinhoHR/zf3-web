This issue will be solved with Zend Framework 2.0. There is no reason why we should support that in a PHP 5.2 framework. No other component (most of them using the plugin loader) support that yet either.

Ben Scholzen: But there is also no reason you should not support it. PHP 5.3 is among us for quite a while...
