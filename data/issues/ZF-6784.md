### Description

When attempting to auto-load files with startup errors: not implementing abstract method; unable to define methods as static; unexected T\_STRING, T\_VARIABLE, etc, you're given a 500 Internal Server error, with no output in the logs.

Test: Created class that's loaded through the autoloader (1.8), with a syntax error. I used: foreach ( $var %optin ); (note missing 'as'). Expected results: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T\_VARIABLE in on line

What I actually get is 500 internal server error, with nothing in the logs.

display errors is on. error\_reporting is set to E\_ALL. Notice errors properly show when 'as' is within the foreach statement. Removing 'as' from the foreach causes internal server error.

The full process of the autoloader is a bit difficult for me to test in my current environment setup; however, I have verified doing a require\_once('PFC/Ws/Optins.php'); early in the process ( \_initConfig() within Boostrap class ) echoes out: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T\_VARIABLE in /home/httpd/dev-sites/application/models/PFC/Ws/Optins.php on line 24

Commenting out that line then just calling: PFC\_Ws\_Optins::OBJECT\_NM results in 500 Internal Server error with no error messages printed out anywhere (nothing in logs, nothing on page).

My deductions conclude it's something with the Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader().

1.8.0 mistakenly enabled the suppressNotFoundWarnings flag. You can disable it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $loader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    $loader->suppressNotFoundWarnings(false);


In 1.8.1, we set the flag to the appropriate value (which displays "not found" and parse errors).
