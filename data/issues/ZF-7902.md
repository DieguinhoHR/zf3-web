### Description

Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim no longer works (i just upgraded from 1.7.3) when the string you wish to trim is '/'.

I get this warning and Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim::filter returns 0 Warning: preg\_replace() [function.preg-replace]: Unknown modifier ']' in Zend/Filter/StringTrim.php on line 112

How to replicate: $stringTrim = new Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim('/'); $stringTrim->filter('/some/uri/here/');

The issue is caused by the forward slash also being the delimiter in the regular expression used. I've prepared a patch that escapes the forward slash properly.

This issue is marked as fixed for the next minor release which is 1.10. Otherwise "Fix-Version" would point to a defined release where this issue has been solved.

IMHO the test case for this issue does not check for the bug reported here. Attaching a changed test case.
