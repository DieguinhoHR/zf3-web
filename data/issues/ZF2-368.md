### Description

Hi,

I'm trying to build a ZF2 application at the moment and I'm using the latest Github source of ZF2. I already checked that I have the fixed version of Bug ZF2-332

I wrote a Controller Plugin and impremented the ServiceManagerAwareInterface. But somehow it does not call setServiceManager() in my plugin. If I write an exit into the setServiceManager() it does not exit there. PHP is giving me a 'Fatal error: Call to a member function get() on a non-object' on this line:$userSerivce = $this->getServiceManager()->get('user\_service');

I've googled and tried almost everything... Nothing seems to work. Have I done something wrong or is this a bug?

Here is my test code:

Plugin.php:

namespace MyApp\\Controller\\Plugin;

use Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\Plugin\\AbstractPlugin; use Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager; use Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManagerAwareInterface;

class AppAuthentication extends AbstractPlugin implements ServiceManagerAwareInterface {

 
    protected $serviceManager;
    
    public function hasIdentity()
    {       
    $userSerivce = $this->getServiceManager()->get('user_service');             
    }
    
    public function getServiceManager()
    {
        return $this->serviceManager;
    }
    
    public function setServiceManager(ServiceManager $serviceManager)
    {
        $this->serviceManager = $serviceManager;
    }


}

module.config.php:

'controller' => array( 'classes' => array( 'app' => 'MyApp\\Controller\\EywaController', 'appIndex' => 'MyApp\\Controller\\IndexController' ), 'map' => array( 'appauth' => 'MyApp\\Controller\\Plugin\\AppAuthentication', ), ),

This problem vanished with the release of Beta 5... So never mind :)
