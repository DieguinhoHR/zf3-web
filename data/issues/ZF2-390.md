### Description

I'm not able to render appended child ViewModels with the name 'entries' inside the template via "echo $this->entries". Also tested with only one ViewModel and with/without PR 1812[1]. The acutal code: <https://gist.github.com/f634d26fa80830874539>

[1] <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1812>
