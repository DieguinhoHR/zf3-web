### Description

After following the directions in ZF-9148, cache files are being created, but are empty.

I have the following lines in my application.ini file:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ; Custom Caches (Adjustments To Default CacheManager)
    resources.cacheManager.page.backend.options.public_dir = APPLICATION_PATH "/../public/cached"
    resources.cacheManager.pagetag.backend.options.cache_dir = APPLICATION_PATH "/../data/cache/tags"


The following is my controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
      public function init()
      {
                $this->_helper->cache(array('index'), array('testentry'));
    
      }
    
      public function indexAction()
      {
        $this->view->testinfo = "Testing";
      }
    }


However, the files produced contain no data whatsoever. It appears that library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php issues an ob\_get\_clean() command prior to the View actually being rendered.

This issue is due to the fact that buffering must be turned off by the user with a param. A ticket (ZF-9600) has been filed to correct the code problem.
