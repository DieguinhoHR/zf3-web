### Description

The code sample for "scripts/load.sqlite.php" requires:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
        realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../library'),
        get_include_path(),
    )));


... before the "require\_once 'Zend/Application.php';" statement (line 20) in order to work (like "public/index.php" does)

[http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)

thanks for all the hard work!

This issue has also been reported in the first part of issue #7401. The solution given there uses:

set\_include\_path(implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, array( realpath(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../library'), get\_include\_path(), )));

This seems a better solution than the one given in this ticket, as it makes use of the existing APPLICATION\_PATH constant and doesn't compute its value a second time.

It's not really working with 1.9.2 on Wamp/Windows :( ; see the error below :

- - - - - -

DOS> C:\\wamp\\www\\Zend\\quickstart>php scripts/load.sqlite.php --withdata

Warning: require\_once(Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\\wamp\\www\\Zend\\quickstart\\scripts\\load.sqlite.php on line 15

Fatal error: require\_once(): Failed opening required 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php ' (include\_path='C:\\wamp\\www\\Zend\\quickstart\\application/../library;.;C:\\php5\\pear') in C:\\wamp\\www\\Zend\\quickstart\\scripts\\load.sqlite.php on line 15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The include\_path in the php.ini is correct ( include\_path = ".;c:\\wamp\\www\\Zend\\library" ) . Is it really fixed ?

Hi

I have download latest version of Zend Framework 1.10.6 and try to configure but getting error as below:

C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\quickstart>php scripts/load.sqlite.php --withdata

The include\_path in the php.ini is (include\_path = ".;C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\zend\\library\\;C:\\xampp\\php\\PEAR")
