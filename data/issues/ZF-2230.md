### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox should NOT render hidden element with "0" value when the name of the checkbox is array-like variable such as

$this->formCheckbox('languages[]', ...

Because programmer usually needs submit only those items, which are checked and not fill the array with zeros

I vote to modify the code something like that

$is\_array = substr($name, -2) == '[]'; if (!$is\_array) { $xhtml .= $this->\_hidden($name, $options[1]); }

Resolved in trunk. The 'options' argument now is no longer used; simply provide a true value to the 'checked' attribute, and the checkbox will be checked appropriately (a false value will leave it unchecked).
