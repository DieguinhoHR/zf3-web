### Description

Hello,

I'm trying to use Zend\_Date with an array to get the result 2010-02-01 00:00 I also checked in the documentation, what is not specified is equal to 0.

So lets try :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $endDate    = new Zend_Date(array(
        'year'   => 2010,
        'month'  => 2,
        'day'    => 1
    ));
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($endDate->toString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm'));


The system return :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(16) "2010-02-01 00:30"


There is 30 minutes here for nothing, I can refresh this minutes stay.

My current timezone is Asia/Singapore and I am in DST.

I tryed to take a look. I found, when I put mktime = false for the function mktime, the system use mktime instead of gmmktime and everything is ok

I hope it will be helpfull

Best Regards

Closing as won't fix.

Asia/Singapore seems to have a 0:30 timezone even is +8 is noted. As this problem is PHP related there is no way for ZF to prevent this (expected) behaviour.

When you still want to use a +8 timezone use Asia/Taipei instead which does not show this problem.
