### Description

I noticed this first in Zend\_OpenID::paramsToQuery but I would assume it could also be elsewhere in the code (code I haven't read through yet).

In order to be more XHTML 1.0 compliant the "&" is recommended over the "&". (See [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C\_12](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_12))

Thanks,

Mike
