### Description

On Ini.php constructor, an exception is thrown when the $filename is empty, but if php wasn't able to open the file, it's not treated. I've got a simple solution. Maybe there is a smarter solution, but this one works fine.

-> Existing code:

$iniArray = parse\_ini\_file($filename, true);

-> Suggested code:

$iniArray = @parse\_ini\_file($filename, true); $error = error\_get\_last(); if (strpos($error["message"], "parse\_ini\_file") !== false) { require\_once 'Zend/Config/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Config\_Exception('File is not readable'); }

Sorry, but error\_get\_last() is PHP5.2 only, and ZF supports PHP 5.1.4 so we cant use your solution. However, be advised that such a bug has found a fix in 1.6 branch of ZF, you should consider upgrading your ZF version thought.

Fixed in 1.6.0
