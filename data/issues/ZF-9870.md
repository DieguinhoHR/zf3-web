### Description

As mentioned in summary, the timestamp value is hardcoded as date('c'). For some of us we use a specific time stamp pattern for our logging to allow for easy parsing via pre-defined regexes. It would be nice if we could override the value before being passed to $event var.

For now I have created a child class which extends Zend\_Log and copied the Log() function contents to the child class to override, kinda messy but gets us by.

Thanks.

Closing since new functionality should not be introduced in mini releases and the fix already was applied in trunk.
