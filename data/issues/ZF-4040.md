ZF-4040: Zend\_Wildfire\_Protocol\_JsonStream->\_encode using bad internal Zend\_Json encoder

### Description

h3.The problem

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Encodes messages into the Wildfire JSON Stream Communication Protocol.
     */
    class Zend_Wildfire_Protocol_JsonStream
    {   ...
        // Use the JSON encoding scheme for the value specified
        protected function _encode($value)
        {
            return Zend_Json_Encoder::encode($value);
        }
        ...
    }


Why there's _Zend\_Json{color:red}\_Encoder{color}_ here in place of _Zend\_Json_?! So I've got my UTF-8 debug output corrupted in FirePHP because of that.

Removing _\_Encoder_ lets Zend\_Json::encode method to choose appropriate JSON encoding method according to PHP's _json\_encode_ function availability. After that my UTF-8 text displays correctly.

h3.Test code with string in russian:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // in bootstrap
    $logger = new Zend_Log(new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug());
    Zend_Registry::set('log', $logger);
    // in controller
    Zend_Registry::get('log')->debug('Some debug text in english is OK'); // that's OK
    Zend_Registry::get('log')->debug('Отладочный русский текст искажается!'); // that's corrupted


May be there's a reason to file another bug on Zend\_Json\_Encoder's \_encodeString method? By the way, give a glance at FirePHP's main standalone class "FirePHP.class.php" and its "json\_encode" method. It actually does the job right! May be ZJE->\_encodeString should follow this example?

That was an oversight. Thanks for pointing it out.

Can you add some test code that logs a message where the UTF-8 test does not display properly?

I have looked into json\_encode and Zend\_Json\_Encoder in more detail.

While json\_encode detects recursion, it does not silently truncate the resulting JSON string but instead throws an exception. Zend\_Json\_Encoder on the other hand truncates it and still returns a valid JSON string.

It is very common to have cyclical relationships in your object graph which should get JSON encoded and sent to the client in a truncated fashion.

The best solution for the encoding would be to try json\_encode first and if it fails fall back to Zend\_Json\_Encoder. This would mean that UTF8 encoded messages cannot contain cyclical object relationships.

The alternative would be to add UTF8 encoding support to Zend\_Json\_Encoder which would be great, but not practical as an immediate fix for this issue.

So would the fallback approach work for now until Zend\_Json\_Encoder supports UTF8 characters?

Looks like my tests were not correct.

json\_encode() nor Zend\_Json\_Encoder silently truncate cyclical relationships.

I'll have to submit a patch for Zend\_Json\_Encoder to silence the cyclical exception.

Waiting for resolution of ZF-4053.

I have decided to stick with Zend\_Json\_Encoder and not try json\_encode() first for the following reasons:

1) Zend\_Json\_Encoder adds more detailed information (i.e. the class name) when it trims cyclical relationships

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "* RECURSION ([Class Name]) *"


2) Zend\_Json\_Encoder adds class hint information to the JSON string

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    {"__className":"[Class Name]", ... }


Zend\_Wildfire\_Protocol\_JsonStream will support UTF-8 characters as soon as Zend\_Json\_Encoder supports them. See issue ZF-4054.

To speed up general support for UTF-8 characters, please lobby for ZF-4054.

The request is for UTF-8 character support. To accomplish this issue ZF-4054 must be resolved.
