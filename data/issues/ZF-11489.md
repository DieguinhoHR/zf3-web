### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9183?focusedCommentId=46962&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-46962)

with reference to my ticket "rt.eurid.eu #107544 mixed characters" all Latin-\* are same script and can be mixed - Zend\_Validate\_Hostname doesn't mix these characters. Please make proper validation. Thanks

You can test validity (length, mixing characters, etc.) of FQDN by <http://www.eurid.eu/en/content/whois>

For example, this is valid .EU IDN domain světdětí (xn--svtdt-3sa23ac)

From the EUrid FAQ ([http://www.eurid.eu/en/faq#IDN\_mix](http://www.eurid.eu/en/faq#IDN_mix)) which you referred to:

{quote}Why can’t I mix scripts in my IDN? IDNs made up of different scripts might look confusingly similar to other domain names if they contained homoglyphs. That is why only one (1) script, or alphabet, can be used in an IDN.{quote}

{quote}Can I use different scripts in my IDN if I separate them with a dash (-)? No. The use of different scripts, or alphabets, in a single IDN is not allowed. IDNs made up of different scripts might look confusingly similar to other domain names, especially if they contained homoglyphs.{quote}

This means: Mixed scripts are not allowed according to IANA and also according to EUrid.

See here for the list of supported scripts by EUrid: [http://eurid.eu/en/eu-domain-names/…](http://www.eurid.eu/en/eu-domain-names/idns-eu/supported-unicode-characters)
