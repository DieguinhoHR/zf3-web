ZF-3611: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox generates duplicate IDs when using empty array notation

### Description

If you use FormCheckbox using the array notation like "array[]", it's currently smart enough not to create the hidden elements, but it still generates duplicate IDs. I might recommend this change, which eschews entirely the business of creating IDs for such elements:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    @@ -121,11 +121,15 @@
             $xhtml = '';
             if (!strstr($name, '[]')) {
                 $xhtml = $this->_hidden($name, $unCheckedValue);
    +            $id = ' id="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"';
             }
    +        else {
    +            $id = '';
    +        }
             $xhtml .= '_htmlAttribs($attribs)

I've attached a patch which reproduces this issue. When creating checkboxes with array notation (ie: foo[]), all elements end up with id="foo", which isn't good HTML.

As far as I can see, there are three options for fixing this issue:

Empty the id attribute when array notation is detected (as OP suggested)
========================================================================

Require that the ID element be specified by the user when calling the helper (breaks BC)
========================================================================================

Use the value as part of the id attribute
=========================================

I've attached a patch which implements the latter - use the value as part of the id attribute. For instance, an array of three checkboxes would currently look something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


After applying my fix, the HTML would look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Thoughts?

Changing the way the id attribute is rendered will cause a backwards-compatibility break. I've marked this issue as postponed to next major release.

ZF provides Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormMultiCheckbox for such an occasion, and it works exactly like you have proposed here (ie: append value to end of id to make it unique)
