ZF-1843: ViewRenderer and Action name case insensitivity
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Example paths:

<http://www.example.com/index/my-script> <http://www.example.com/index/myscript>

Both paths will call "myScriptAction()" method in "IndexController" (unfortunately). The problem is that with the first path, ViewRenderer will try to render my-script.phtml, and with the second path, myscript.phtml. Normally only one of the scripts would exist, and an exception of such nature would be thrown.

Ideally, if possible, action methods would be case sensitive, and the second path would dispatch to the error handler with a no action exception type. This might not be possible with current PHP versions though.

ViewRenderer inflection is causing multiple issues

There are two issues here:

how controller and action names are stored in the request object
================================================================

how those are then resolved to view scripts by the ViewRenderer
===============================================================

In the second case, this is a "won't fix" issue. Current enhancements in the trunk allow you to modify the rules used for resolving the view scripts via the attached Zend\_Filter\_Inflector object; you can customize these rules to suit your own custom file system layout -- including removing the current casting to lowercase.

In the first case, we have a language limitation. camelCasedAction names should be written on the URL as camel-cased-action names -- i.e., dash separated (dot separating works as well). These are then resolved to the appropriate action, with the appropriate casing. If you camelCase the names on the URL, they are actually normalized to lowercase internally. The language limitation hits because PHP itself is case-insensitive when it comes to _calling_ functions -- so camelcasedAction() will work the same as camelCasedAction(). The problem is that internally, the first will be stored as 'camelcased' and the second as 'camel-cased' -- which will resolve differently by the ViewRenderer.

This is the primary issue that leads to a perceived discrepancy. The "solution" currently is to make sure you use word separators ('.' and '-') when publishing your URLs to ensure the correct action name is propagated, and then make sure you name your action scripts appropriately or setup your own custom inflection rules.

Won't fix, because the problem is primarily a language limitation that bubbles up the chain (as described in a previous comment).
