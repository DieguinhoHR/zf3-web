### Description

I'm just learning Zend for 2 days but i think i found bug in the end of autoload method of Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource.

Now it looks like this:

 
    ....
        $final = substr($class, strlen($lastMatch));
        $path = $this->_components[$lastMatch];
        return include $path . '/' . str_replace('_', '/', $final) . '.php';
    }


I think line with return should be like this:

return include $path . str\_replace('\_', '/', $final).'.php';

original line make '//' in path and file isn't include.

Check me please if i'm right.

Thanks Andy

Patch to match remove double // from generated path

Fixed in r18169 - component path was not being trimmed. Let me know if this does not, by chance, resolve your issue - the patch was a bit ambiguous compared to the issue description and comment.
