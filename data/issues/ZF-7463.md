Partly works for windows platform

If a folder c:\\new\\new is specified and the c:\\new doesn't exist it fails on the same error, but when c:\\new exists it works

Hi,

You can recreate the problem in this way:

1) ./zf.sh create project /tmp - It works, and all zf project stuff is created under /tmp, including /tmp/.zfproject.xml 2) ./zf.sh create project /tmp/anya - doesn't work.

I get a fatal error: Catchable fatal error: Argument 4 passed to Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console\_HelpSystem::\_respondWithCommand() must be an instance of Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Metadata\_Tool, null given, called in /usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/HelpSystem.php on line 300 and defined in /usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/HelpSystem.php on line 348

Also /tmp/.zfproject.xml the 2) command starts to work

Enjoy, Anya

Tried reproducing with 1.11.0, cannot reproduce. There were significant change to Zend\_Tool in 1.10, perhaps one of them may have fixed your issue.

If that is not the case, please feel free to reopen.

Thanks! Ralph
