### Description

After holiday I upgraded to Zend Framework 1.10.7 and made my first bug and found out that Zend\_Log\_Writer\_ZendMonitor was failing using Zend Server 5.0.2.

After doing some research i found this bug <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10081> that is been fixed for 1.10.7. User who filled out that bug was using Zend Platform (product that has come discontinued).

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_ZendMonitor is ment to use with Zend Server Monitor, says Reference Guide so I did some digging and found that api for monitor has changed from Platform to Server: - [http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Platform/…](http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Platform/monitor_functions.htm) - [http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Server/…](http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Server/zend_monitor_-_php_api.htm#function-zend_monitor_custom_event)

from: void monitor\_custom\_event(string $class, string $text[, integer $severe, mixed $user\_data]) to: void zend\_monitor\_custom\_event (string $class, string $text, mixed $user\_data)

Some how monitor\_custom\_event-function is still available for Zend Server, but singnature is same as it is for zend\_monitor\_custom\_event.

Both Platform and Server can be supported (I think, but didn't test) doing sniff if zend\_monitor\_custom\_event (I think this isn't available in Zend Platform) is present then using it and if not using monitor\_custom\_event.

Or \_\_constructor should fail if Zend Platform is used.

Fixed in trunk and 1.11 release branch. The original code was based off of a beta or RC of Zend Server -- and the API was later changed. Additionally, it was modified such that it was no longer compatible with Zend Platform.

I've updated the code to "sniff" for Zend Server, and to operate differently based on whether Zend Server is detected or Zend Platform is used.

The fix will be in 1.11.1.
