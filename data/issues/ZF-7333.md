### Description

When i create a new object with Zend\_Feed\_Atom, like this $obj = new Zend\_Feed\_Atom(my\_host) ZFA use Zend\_Validator.

Because i use my own trigger, i get this error:

line: 62 inet\_pton() : Unrecognized address <www.XXX.com> Zend/Validate/Ip.php

It returns by Zend\_Validate\_Ip.

Maybe Zend\_Feed should have a new optionnal parameter in order to validate an ip or an host.

Once 1.9.0 is released, please use Zend\_Feed\_Reader, which has much more robust Atom support. We will not continue supporting Zend\_Feed, nor adding additional features to it.
