### Description

The file and line info is offset for FirePHP messages sent via Zend\_Wildfire.

This is a result of a change in stack depth for backtraces (used to determine this info) likely due to some refactoring work unrelated to Zend\_Wildfire.

Also found a bug where file and line info is incorrect when using Zend\_Log aliases instead of send().
