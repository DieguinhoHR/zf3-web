### Description

In Zend framework 2, we needn't pass a belongsTo parameter in order to have elemnt name with brackets.

I've seen that we can now define the name directly with brackets in the name element property.

However there is a problem at the validation time. The setData function seem to not work properly because it doesn't keep the selected value and reset it simply.

Thanks in advance for your support.
