### Description

PHPdoc comment for Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::getList() declares that method will always return array, but in a case if there is no translations are available in adapter it returns NULL.

From source code:

 
    /**
     * Returns the available languages from this adapter
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function getList()
    {
        $list = array_keys($this->_translate);
        $result = null;    // <--- This is wrong, it should be $result = array();
        foreach($list as $value) {
            if (!empty($this->_translate[$value])) {
                $result[$value] = $value;
            }
        }
        return $result;
    }
