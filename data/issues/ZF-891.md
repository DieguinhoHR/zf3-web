### Description

This is very similar to bug ZF-464, which pertained to a similar handling in the ORDER BY clause.

Please do not attempt to split comma-separated strings into an array. Commas may occur in SQL expressions, and it would require a complex parser to distinguish commas that separate terms from commas that appear in SQL expressions.

Instead, just typecast the argument to group(), \_tableCols(), and order() to an array. A simple string will be cast into a one-element array.

If elements must be separate, the user's recommended solution is to use an array. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->group( array('column1', 'column2') );
