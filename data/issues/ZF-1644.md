ZF-1644: Order of parameters in Extension\_FeedLink and Extension\_EntryLink is not optimal

### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_FeedLink currently has it's constructor parameters in the following order: \* countHint \* href \* readOnly \* rel \* feed

This is inconvenient, since the most likely used parameters are not at the beginning. Instead, they should be rearranged as follows: \* rel \* href \* (others)

This will break backwards compatibility, so we should think about this before implementing it. However, I think the improvement in usability justifies the change.

Added Extension\_EntryLink to the title since this applies equally to both.
