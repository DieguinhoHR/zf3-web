ZF-6113: Zend\_Ldap $\_options member not declared
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-23T17:33:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-20T11:17:15.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.0 (31/Jul/09)

### Description

The $\_options array in the Zend\_Ldap class is not declared, ie the following is missing

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_options;


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_options = array();


This isn't critical as PHP allows the arbitrary instantiation of class members at run-time however I don't think the default "public" visibility is appropriate.

Fixed in trunk for minor-release 1.9 (incorporation of new Zend\_Ldap into trunk)
