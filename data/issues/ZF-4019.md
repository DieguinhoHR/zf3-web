### Description

My page is connected with multiples databases. I activate Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug as profiler for each one. I enable it for each one. But I only receive the table in Firebug for the first registered database.

This is not OK :). You try to register multiple times the Plugin (apparently for each db). This code functions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Register this object as a controller plugin.
     * 
     * @return void
     */
    protected function _registerControllerPlugin()
    {
        static $already_made = false;
        $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        try {
            if (!$already_made) {
                $controller->registerPlugin($this, self::$_controllerPluginStackIndex);
                $already_made=true;
            }
        } catch (Zend_Controller_Exception $e) {
            // Exception indicates plugin is already registered
            // which we simply ignore
        }
    }

Is it displaying a log entry for each DB? It does work for me. Also see the Zend\_Wildfire demo.

While the code calls $controller->registerPlugin repeatedly it is in fact only registered once as the registerPlugin() method throws an exception if the plugin is already registered.

I guess the way I am doing it at the moment is no the "clean" way. Rather than keeping a flag in my code I would prefer to call a method on Zend\_Controller\_Front called isPluginRegistered().

Let's open a new issue for this if the multiple DB logging is working as intended.

My problem is with Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug not with Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug, is that your question?

Without my code, I have nothing in Firebug. With my code, I have the 2 tables in Firebug. Is my response correct?

I understand: I have xDebug which catch the exception before your try/catch.

I should not rely on the exception for control flow. I'll work on a fix. It will probably not make it into 1.6.0, but will be in 1.6.1

The issue is resolved other than when xDebug is installed.

Fixed with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _registerControllerPlugin()
        {
            $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
            if (!$controller->hasPlugin(get_class($this))) {
                $controller->registerPlugin($this, self::$_controllerPluginStackIndex);
            }        
        }
