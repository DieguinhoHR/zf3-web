ZF-524: Change all private Zend\_View\_Abstract properties and methods to protected

### Description

Why are there private methods and properties in an abstract class? Until Zend\_View\_Interface is created, it would be best to change all the private things to protected. In order to extend Zend\_View completely I had to do this.

The reason most methods and properties of Zend\_View\_Abstract are private has to do with variable and method scope from within the actual view scripts. View scripts are included directly within the render() method, and thus have access to all public and protected methods and properties of the object instance, but not to those marked private. This helps prevent the view scripts from having uncontrolled access to the entire view object.

Zend\_View\_Interface will correct the issue you present regarding difficulty extending the base view class; it will provide a slimmed-down interface for the developer may implement when desiring to use a different template engine in the framework. Since this class is on the roadmap for the next release, and because changing the visibility of the Zend\_View\_Abstract methods and properties would have far-ranging effects within the view scripts, it does not make sense to change Zend\_View\_Abstract at this time.

Thanks, Matthew! I'm changing my PHPTAL implementation over to use Zend\_View\_Interface right now.
