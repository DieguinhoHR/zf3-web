ZF-7860: IsImage filter no longer works with fileinfo extension in PHP5.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This validator doesn't seem to work any more after upgrading to PHP5.3 (which now comes with fileinfo extension built in)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mime = new finfo(FILEINFO_MIME);
    $this->_type = $mime->file($value);


file() used to return just "image/jpeg", now it returns "image/jpeg; charset=binary". This no longer matches values in the predefined array and validation fails.

Fixed with r18147.

You could instead use Zend\_Validate\_MimeType which works already under 5.3 with this ZF release.
