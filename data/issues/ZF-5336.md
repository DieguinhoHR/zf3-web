### Description

Here's my test case (reproduced using both ZF 1.7.1 and 1.7.2):

PHP:

 <?php require\_once('Zend/Filter.php'); require\_once('Zend/Filter/Input.php'); require\_once('Zend/Validate/Between.php'); $validators = array( 'username' => 'Alnum', 'key' => array( 'Alnum', new Zend\_Validate\_Between(13, 128), ), 'password' => array('presence' => 'required'), ); $input = array( 'username' => 'thisisme', 'key' => '1234567891111416', // 16 characters 'password' => 'mywrittensecret' ); $input = new Zend\_Filter\_Input(NULL, $validators, $input); if ($input->hasInvalid() || $input->hasMissing()) { echo '
    ' . print_r($input->getMessages(), true) . '

'; } ?> - - - - - -

Outputs:
--------

Array ( [key] => Array ( [notBetween] => '1234567891111416' is not between '13' and '128', inclusively )

)

Sorry but '1234567891111416' is far away from '128'. The error message you are getting is correct and not a false behaviour.

When you want to validate the string length then you have to use the StringLength validator.

Thanks Thomas, perhaps the documentation could be made more clear on this as well.

Currently it states: Returns true if and only if $value is between the minimum and maximum boundary values. The comparison is inclusive by default ($value may equal a boundary value), though this may be overridden in order to do a strict comparison,...

To me that sounds like (minimum <= $value <= maximum) but I supppose it's actually (minimum >= $value >= maximum)

Then the rest of the paragraph says: " where $value must be strictly greater than the minimum and strictly less than the maximum. " Which at first glance seems to contradict.

Instead it should read something like this:

Returns true if and only if $value is outside (greater or less than) the minimum and maximum boundary values. The comparison is inclusive by default ($value may equal a boundary value), though this may be overridden in order to do a strict comparison, where $value must be strictly greater than the minimum and strictly less than the maximum. "
