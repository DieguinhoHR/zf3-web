### Description

by inserting an large text (greater than 5484 chars in ut8 charset, we uses "a's" as test character) into a database field Zend\_Db\_Statement causes an Apache segmentation fault the script dies in line 187 of Zend\_Db\_Statement without any exception to be caught

 
        // remove 'foo\'bar'
        $sql = preg_replace("/$q($qe|[^$q])*$q/", '', $sql);


We are using php 5.4.2 and apache 2.0 and apache 2.2 versions, and all versions are affected even if we use Zend Core php
