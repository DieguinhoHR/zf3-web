ZF-4689: Temporary Directory can't be altered

### Description

It's impossible to change the temporary upload directory, since Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_getTmpDir() tries sys\_get\_temp\_dir() first.

Sys\_get\_temp\_dir() relies on the temporary path of the OS, so if I change the path in the php.ini, in the .htaccess or per ini\_set it doesn't have any effect on Zend\_File\_Transfer and respectively won't work.

Please add a setTmpDir() method or change the order.

Thanks

This is not true... According to PHP manual:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string sys_get_temp_dir ( void )
    Returns the path of the directory PHP stores temporary files in by default. 


So this is the temporary download path which is defined in the PHP.INI.

Remember that Zend\_File\_Transfer has no access to the script when it uploads the file from client to server. It is stored in this temporary path automatically by the webserver and php core. As soon as the upload is finished ZF has access to the file but then it's already stored in the temporary path.

To have your files stored in another individual path you must simply set a destination. Only files for which no destination was given, the temp path is used.
