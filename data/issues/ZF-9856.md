I use {quote}Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('extend\_month' => false));{quote} in my bootstrap to disable month calculations BUT it won't works.

{quote} Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('extend\_month' => false)); $date = new Zend\_Date(); $date->setMonth(2); $date->setDay(31); echo $date->toString();

03.03.2010 17:30:44 {quote}

Not reproduceable.

Reproduction: Line 1: debug = 19.Mai.2010 16:00:00 +01:00 Line 2: debug = 19.Mai.2010 16:00:00 +01:00 (because when no month is given the actual month is used which means that May is overwritten with May) Line 3: debug = 31.Mai.2010 16:00:00 +01:00 Line 4: debug = 31.05.2010 16:00:00

Oh sorry i forgot some code,

{quote} $date = new Zend\_Date(); $date->setMonth(2); $date->setDay(31); {quote}

what i wanted to show is, that even with disabled month calculations the day is set to 03.03.2010 not to 28.03.2010.

I modified the code to show what i mean.

extend\_month is for dates when month is given and prevents the break into the next month. This option does not work for days because you could also add "90" days intentionally.

Note: When you set the 31th on february then there is no way why the 28.May should be returned.

From the Documentation: {quote}When adding or substracting months from an existing date, the resulting value for the day of the month might be unexpected, if the original date fell on a day close to the end of the month. For example, when adding one month to January 31st, people familiar with SQL will expect February 28th as the result. On the other side, people familiar with Excel and OpenOffice will expect March 3rd as the result. The problem only occurs, if the resulting month does not have the day, which is set in the original date. For Zend Framework developers, the desired behavior is selectable using the extend\_month option to choose either the SQL behaviour, if set to FALSE, or the spreadsheet behaviour when set to TRUE.{quote}

As i understand if i do {quote}$date = new Zend\_Date(); $date->setMonth(2); $date->setDay(31);{quote} then the result should be 28.02.2010 if extend\_month is set to false and not 03.03.2010. Or not?

Now i understand. If i SET the day extend\_month is ignored but if i calculate (subtract or add) then i get the expected result. {quote} $date = new Zend\_Date(); $date->setMonth(1); $date->setDay(31); $date->addMonth(1); echo $date->toString(); {quote} I think that is not the expected result for everyone. If it is intentend then it should be clarified in documentation.

The manual clearly reads:

{quote} When adding or substracting months from an existing date {quote}

as you noted yourself.
