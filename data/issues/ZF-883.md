ZF-883: getDate() / \_parseDate() automatically attempt to fix invalid dates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

getDate() automatically tries to fix dates where: - the month and days are specified backwards (when the value for month > 12), - the month and year are swapped, and the value for month > 12, - etc.

However, this does not give the option for a developer to use parse/normalize dates and detect invalid dates. Also, heuristics are not always perfect, and some invalid date strings might be detectable, but not fixed correctly (e.g. "13-abc-2006").

When dates do not conform to the expected format, and can not or should not be fixed, a helpful exception message with diagnostic information would be nice, such as: Zend\_Locale\_Exception: unable to parse date '2006 10 Nov' using 'dd.MM.yyyy'

But this change gives problem on standard format.

Using the standard format all variants of dates for a locale should be parsed. It would be better to have eighter a possibility for seperating on fix or loose parsing or have an optional function for fix/loose parsing.

Sometimes it is not wished to have a fix format if someone just want to extract a date from an string but does not know which format it has.

getDate itself was designed to accept any format and variant of date and return the best matching result. I would not want to have the format fixed by truncating possibilities.

Your Feedback ?

Please define what is meant by "standard format".

Also, see new function getFixedDate() committed with the patch (under FishEye link).

I appreciate the new approach with getFixedDate() and getDate().

But in my eyes the standard format of a locale should be loose coupled.

Example:

new Zend\_Date('10.Okt.2006', Zend\_Date::DATES); new Zend\_Date('2006/Okt/10', Zend\_Date::DATES);

getFixedDate would throw an exeption because this date is not in standard format. getDate would accept it and try to fix the false locale/date part.

The standard format Zend\_Date::DATES should be loose coupled and accept date formats which are not streight.

Diagnostic exceptions should only be thrown if a fix constant is used like Zend\_Date::DATE\_FULL. Background:

Zend\_Date::DATES does relay on one of the other date constants, which one of them is defined within the locale.

{quote}getFixedDate would throw an exeption because this date is not in standard format.{quote}

I think you mean getDate would throw an exeption because this date is not in standard format, and getFixedDate() would not throw an exception, if the date could be fixed.

I agree with keeping "loose coupling" between Zend\_Date::DATES format and date creation using new Zend\_Date(). I'm opening a new issue to cover this.

That's what I meant.
