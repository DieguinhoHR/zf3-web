ZF-10355: Additional option to Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Multidb and Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db for adding Adapter(s) to Zend\_Registry

### Description

Needed a way for Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session, when using Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable, to explicitly set the DbAdapter when also using Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Multidb and when the necessary Session adapter was NOT the Zend\_Db\_Table default adapter.

By optionally adding the Multidb adapters to the Zend\_Registry via a 'registryKey' option, you are able to use any of your configured Multidb adapters for the Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable, regardless of the default adapter.

Similar discussion found here: [http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/â€¦](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Zend-Application-Resource-Multidb-td1460058.html)

See attached patch file. Added new 'registryKey' option to Multidb and Db Resource classes, with updated docs and unit tests. Added it to Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db since there appeared to be concern about backwards compatibility from Multidb in the Nabble discussion by Ralph Schindler.

Patched against trunk r22874.

We're moving away from storing everything in a singleton instance of zend\_registry, and rather save everything in zend\_app, which acts as DI container. Having said that, we'd have to discuss if we want it to be all stored in zend\_registry.

Understood. Thank you for reviewing.

Yes perhaps some kind of registry attached to zend\_app that the application resources can interact with to access these types of shared objects.

Closing as wont-fix for the reasons outlined above.
