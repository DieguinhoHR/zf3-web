### Description

h3. Example 65.1. jQuery() View Helper Example \\ In the following paragraph:

{quote} Both helpers now stacked some javascript statements on the jQuery helper and printed a link and a form element respectively. To access the javascript we have to utilize the jQuery() functionality. Both helpers already activated their dependencies that is they have called jQuery()->enable() and _jQuery()->enableUi()_ . We only have to print the jQuery() environment, and we choose to do so in the layout script's head segment: {quote}

It says "jQuery->enableUi()" but the correct method name is "jQuery()->uiEnable()". The problem is also existent in the German version, but I am not sure whether I should open a second issue for the german version.
