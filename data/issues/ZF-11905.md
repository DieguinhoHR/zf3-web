### Description

Any reason why Zend\_Soap\_Client does not know of the "typemap" option? {quote} The typemap option is an array of type mappings. Type mapping is an array with keys type\_name, type\_ns (namespace URI), from\_xml (callback accepting one string parameter) and to\_xml (callback accepting one object parameter). {quote}

Adding a patch with tests, only testing that an array of typemap arrays will be passed, not tested if a typemap may work.

As far as i know, type\_name and type\_ns and atleast one of the callbacks to\_xml or from\_xml are necessary to make this feature work. Maybe ZF could help with the usage by warning users if they haven't specified these options. We of course would not want to limit the usage again so this better be worked out and tested seperately.
