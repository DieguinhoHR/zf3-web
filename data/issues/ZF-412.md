### Description

Quote from Lucene index file format description:
------------------------------------------------

Deletable File

A file named "deletable" contains the names of files that are no longer used by the index, but which could not be deleted. This is only used on Win32, where a file may not be deleted while it is still open. On other platforms the file contains only null bytes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importance of this feature is increased, if we have optimization functionality finished.

Problem is gone with new index format support. Index folder clean-up performs necessary tasks.
