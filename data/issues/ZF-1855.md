### Description

When searching for action helper classes, the HelperBroker searches paths in the order that they were added, instead of the reverse of this (which is what Zend\_View does when looking for things). This means that if you have a custom action helper that is named similar to a Zend one (for example: My\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer), it will never be found by Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getHelper() or getStaticHelper() because the Zend one will always be picked up first.
