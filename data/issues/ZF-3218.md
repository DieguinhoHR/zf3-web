ZF-3218: Doctype set in Layout script is not persisted to views

### Description

A doctype set in a Zend\_Layout script ie:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?= $this->doctype('XHTML1_STRICT') ?>
    www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    
        ...


is not passed through to view scripts that are being rendered within the layout, forms being rendered with Zend\_Form are therefore being rendered invalid (missing closing tags) when the doctype has been set to XHTML1\_STRICT.

I think, "it is not a bug, but feature". You have to set the doctype before rendering views. Layout is rendered in postDispatch (after action scritp rendering) --> doctype set in layout doesn't affect it.

I use an extra controller which extens Zend\_Controller\_Action and my controllers extends it.

This behavior is correct. The application view scripts cannot know the doctype unless it has already been set. Layouts are rendered _after_ application view scripts, and thus setting the doctype at that time is too late.

The solution is to set your doctype early, in your bootstrap or an early running plugin.
