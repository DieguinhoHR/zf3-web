ZF-7892: Provider with Specialties only will not be displayed in Help System
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-19T02:35:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:39.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

A provider that has only specialties will only be partially displayed in the help system:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Entity_Provider_Entity extends Zend_Tool_Framework_Provider_Abstract
    {
        protected $_specialties = array('Update', 'Export', 'Validate');
    
        public function schemaUpdate() { }
        public function schemaExport() { }
        public function schemaValidate() { }
    }


Calling "zf --help" the expected output would be something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Providers and their actions:
      Entity                    
        zf schema entity
        Note: There are specialties, use zf schema entity.? to get specific help on them.


However there will be only:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Providers and their actions:
        Note: There are specialties, use zf schema entity.? to get specific help on them.


You have to add the schema() method also:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Entity_Provider_Entity extends Zend_Tool_Framework_Provider_Abstract
    {
        protected $_specialties = array('Update', 'Export', 'Validate');
    
        public function schema() { }
        public function schemaUpdate() { }
        public function schemaExport() { }
        public function schemaValidate() { }
    }


There are two viewpoints on this problem:

1. Provider Name and help will only be displayed if at least one top-level action exist. What if only specialties are existent? Throw an exception that this is an unsupported behaviour? Every speciality has to have a top-level action?
2. Display some other format for Specialties without top-level action, like:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    Providers and their actions:
      Entity                    
        zf schema.[update|export|validate] entity
        Note: There are specialties, use zf schema entity.? to get specific help on them.
