ZF-3279: getVars method missing in Zend\_View\_Interface, or incorrect condition used in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch::postJsonContext()

### Description

In Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch class, postJsonContext() method checks if the view implements Zend\_View\_Interface and based on that calls getVars() method. The problem is that getVars method is not defined in Zend\_View\_Interface. So any custom view class, not extending Zend\_View\_Abstract, fails on this line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $vars = Zend_Json::encode($view->getVars());


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($view instanceof Zend_View_Interface) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Json
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Json.php';
                $vars = Zend_Json::encode($view->getVars());
                $this->getResponse()->setBody($vars);
    }

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

I'm not sure if adding getVars() to the interface will break BC but IMO it should be there. I'm going to do some testing just to make sure it doesn't break anything and if it doesn't then I'll post the fix.

While we likely should add getVars() to the interface, this would definitely be a BC break. The better short-term solution would be to check for the existence of the getVars() method in the $view object, and raise an exception if not available. This will then help future proof people's impementations for when we can safely do a BC break (2.0).

Attached is my proposal for a patch to fix this. I'm still working on a unit test.
