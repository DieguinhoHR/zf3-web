### Description

Hi! The getActionContexts function doesn't returns context for ALL actions in controller when $action = null

At line 1307, $action is forced to string.. :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $action     = (string) $action;


And At line 1314, $action is tested and can't be null...:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (null !== $action) {
    ....


Possible fixe :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getActionContexts($action = null)
        {
            $controller = $this->getActionController();
            if (null === $controller) {
                return array();
            }
            
            $contextKey = $this->_contextKey;
    
            if (!isset($controller->$contextKey)) {
                return array();
            }
    
            if (null !== $action) {
                $action     = (string) $action;
                if (isset($controller->{$contextKey}[$action])) {
                    return $controller->{$contextKey}[$action];
                } else {
                    return array();
                }
            }
    
            return $controller->$contextKey;
        }


Thanks

The docblock header says that it should return all configured contexts when no argument is provided, however this was never implemented (or, at least, never implemented correctly). As best I can tell, the getActionContexts method was added in r7547 (2008/01/21, [see here](http://framework.zend.com/code/diff.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftrunk%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FController%2FAction%2FHelper%2FContextSwitch.php&rev=7547&peg=23772)) and hasn't changed substantially since then.

I've attached a patch which corrects the issue, and will ping Matthew to determine if the existing behavior can be changed safely at this late stage of ZFv1's lifecycle.
