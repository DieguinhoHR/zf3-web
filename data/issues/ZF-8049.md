### Description

as [http://wonderlandlabs.com/wll\_drupal/lamp/â€¦](http://wonderlandlabs.com/wll_drupal/lamp/zf/routing.html) documents, if you go down a route path, the path you go down changes how the page renders its' url. that is if you have a route /admin/:module/:action and you go to admin/pages/index.. your menu URLs will all begin with /admin/ !

For archival purposes: {quote}For some reason if you use routes, Zend\_Navigation will interpret urls that it renders from pages objects according to the route that landed you on the page you're on. This means that menus, breadcrumb, etc. will be parsed with strange URL patterns and presumptiions about controller/module/action values as designated in your router. For instance, if I click on a link with admin/ as a prefix, all my menu items will suddenly have admin/ as a prefix!

To un-fuck up your pages, after you've been routed, (i.e., in an action plugin or a view helper) include this snippet: $router = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getRouter(); $fake\_route = new Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http(); $fake\_route->setRequestUri('/'); $router->route($fake\_route);

This will flip the front controller back to the default router.{quote}

Assigning to Robin. This is actually not so much a router issue as a Zend\_Navigation issue; the router is behaving as expected and documented.

What's the issue here? Is it the old "you have to specify route/module/controller/action for each page, otherwise the generated links will be weird"? If so, that's not a bug. It's just how the URL helper (which in turn uses the route's assemble() method) works.

Okay, so I guess this is not an issue anymore.
