### Description

Using the latest RC1 Zend and Skeleton Application.

Create two or more modules and add an en\_US.mo file to each of the language folders.

In your config/application.config.php file add the modules: 'modules' => array('Application', 'Test') Now when you visit the site only the translations in "Test" are actually translated. All translations in Application are not. Comment out "Test" in the modules configuration and now Application is translating just fine.

At this moment only the last module listed in the configuration is actually being translated.

Each module must use its own text domain.

Ben,

Am I missing something then? Because the latest skeleton has this support already. All I did was as stated above and then use $this->translate('SomeID'); in the view.

Each Module configuration has:

 
    'service_manager' => array(
        'factories' => array(
            'translator' => 'Zend\I18n\Translator\TranslatorServiceFactory',
        ),
    ),
    'translator' => array(
        'locale' => 'en_US',
        'translation_patterns' => array(
            array(
                'type'     => 'gettext',
                'base_dir' => __DIR__ . '/../language',
                'pattern'  => '%s.mo',
            ),
        ),
    ),


So all I should need to do is create a language directory inside of that module and then call $this->translate('SomeID'); and it should be translated from the en\_US.mo file contained within that modules language directory.

Can you please give clarification to this issue. Based on the Skeleton App there is no textdomain settings in the config/module.config.php file for setting this missing option.

I don't want to be a pain but saying each module must use it's own textdomain isn't much of an answer when something like this isn't clear. The documentation at this moment also shows nothing of a setup like the default SkeletonApp currently has in it's configs.

I really appreciate it.

Marking this as a documentation improvement.

After much headache and having to look at the source I think I've resolved this issue.

In the translator\_patterns a new option needs to be provided as 'text\_domain' => 'someidgoeshere'

Then when you do echo $this->translate('translationtexthere', 'someidgoeshere');

I'd update the documentation myself but the current documentation does not state anything about how to use the default SkeletonApp setup. The documentation only provides information from a factory setup.
