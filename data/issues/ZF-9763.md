ZF-9763: Zend\_Rest\_Server: XML output should not include generator, class and method information

### Description

Currently the XML generated by Zend\_Rest\_Server includes the class and method names called by the Zend\_Rest\_Server instance. This causes potential security concerns as it exposes the private details of the implementation.

For example, from the output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1Car2Trucksuccess

One can gather that it was generated with Zend Framework using the call Test\_Service\_Product::getRecent.

Zend\_Rest\_Server should provide the option to only output the data as XML:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1Car2Truck
