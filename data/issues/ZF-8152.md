ZF-8152: No results for trivial fuzzy search

### Description

Hello there!

I made an index with a custom analyzer, I call it Utf8NumComplex (there's a small modification in tokenization, instead of preg\_match('/[\\p{L}\\p{N}]+/u' at line 90 I wrote preg\_match('/[\\p{L}]+|[\\p{N}]+/u' so that it would index better).

The problem is this: for an indexed keyword, for example "e-commerce", a fuzzy search for the word without dash "ecommerce~" returns 0 hits. However, if I search with Luke, the keyword is found. What's the problem ? The similarity algorithms look the same to me. Am I missing something?

Alex

Fuzzy query uses non-fuzzy prefix for searching matched terms. Default prefix length is 3 (the same as in Lucene 2.3, if I'm correct).

It's used to increase search speed (terms dictionary scanning for 'eco\*' is much faster than full terms dictionary scan).

Another prefix length (including '0') can be set using Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Fuzzy::setDefaultPrefixLength($newPrefixLength) call.

Please reopen issue if it doesn't solve a problem.

PS Don't forget to set your analyzer as default before query parsing/searching.

I have followed your suggestion and modified the DefaultPrefixLength to 0. My string "e-commerce" was indeed found, the "minor" setback was that the search took about {color:red}_8 seconds_{color} to execute with ZF Lucene while Luke (using Apache Lucene 2.9) took.. {color:red}800 us{color}.

So.. I'm still wondering if there's a wonder algorithm somewhere that makes Apache Lucene so much faster than the PHP one :)

PS My analyzer was set as default when creating the index and when I searched it :). Thanks for the suggestion anyway. PPS The index format that Luke recognized (the one made by ZF Lucene) is Lucene 2.2

I'm sorry, I skipped an _8_.. Apache Lucene 2.9's search took _{color:red}8800 us{color}_ (but that's still 0.0088 seconds). The search was performed against about 16500 terms.
