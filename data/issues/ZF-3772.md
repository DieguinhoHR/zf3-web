### Description

Example 44.11 uses TMX format to show how to configure directory scanning for languages but it is followed by a note saying "This works only for adapters which do not include the language within the source file. Using this option for example with TMX will be ignored."

I think that using another format for the example would be less confusing.

I'm confused...

Example 44.10 uses TMX adapter and shows directory scanning with locale by source content. Example 44.11 uses Gettext adapter and shows directory scanning with locale by directory name.

I don't see the problem in the used examplecode as it works as described. Maybe you can be more detailed which problem you see ?

Tested example code, and it works as described. No problems found. Please reopen if you still see problems.
