ZF-6063: Implementation of the magic method \_\_isset is missing in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryHit

### Description

It is not possible to check if a field of a QueryHit is empty with the empty() function.

e.g.: When i have a field "content", i would access this by calling:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $hit->content;


It is not possible to check, if the field is empty with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (empty($hit->content))  {...}


empty($hit->content) is always true. I think this is because the \_\_isset method is not implemented in the QueryHit object and isset is the first check that is done by empty
