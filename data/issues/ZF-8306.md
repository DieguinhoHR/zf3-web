### Description

When you crate module using Zend\_Tool, it is not working until this line:

resources.frontController.moduleDirectory = APPLICATION\_PATH "/modules"

is added in /application/configs/application.ini It would be nice to have it done automatically. (tested on latest incubator)

This doesn't seem to be working in 1.10 either.

Is there any intent to fix this? I got a bug filed against the Fedora ZF package regarding this bug at [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=611327](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=611327) A quick status update would be appreciated.
