### Description

While trying to use a static filter, I discovered that some of the filters where throwing an Exception from the Loader. In fact, I ran a test and descovered that 109 out 113 plugins failed.

Code for the test here: <http://www.pastebucket.com/1185>

First the pastebucket provided is testing Validator\\StaticValidator instead of Filter\\StaticFilter

Fixing this I obtained 27 out 113 failed and some PHP errors

I don't found any issue, some Filters need arguments and others have external dependencies.

All are loaded without exceptions
