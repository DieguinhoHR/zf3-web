### Description

Adrien Miquel writes:

It's just to tell you that there is probably a bug in Zend\_Date.

I'm explaining : in the framework's documentation it's said that the constant for ISO 8601 date output 'yy' describes the year with AT LEAST two digits, but in fact it describes the year with ONE OR TWO digits. This is because the format 'yy' uses the year constant Zend\_Date::YEAR\_SHORT (line 486 in Zend\_Date.php). So, if these three lines are removed, 'yy' will effectively describes the year with at least two digits.

Sorry, but I can't see the problem...

When I code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date->toString('yy');


I get '09' returned...

Also the definition is 2 digit...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        const YEAR_SHORT     = 'YEAR_SHORT';     // y - 2 digit year, leading zeros 00-99


Removing these 3 lines will cause other code to fail...

Please provide a testcode where the problem can be seen and fixed.

PS: 'yy' does not return ISO8601 date but non ISO year... ISO YEAR is 'YY' !!

@Bill: Maybe you can forward this to Adrien, when he does not have write priviledges to jira.

Hi Thomas,

the problem is that if you code :

 
    <pre class="highlight">$date = new Zend_Date('1-1-1') ;
    echo $date->toString('yy');

you will get returned '1' and not '01', which should be the result expected according to the Zend\_Date's doc. This issue affects 'yy' and 'YY' constants.

Changed handling of dates lower than 10BC and greater an 10AD with SVN 6240.
