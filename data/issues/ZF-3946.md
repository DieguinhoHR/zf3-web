### Description

I am on r10901 (standard/trunk), the view helper works - but the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit wrapper doesn't.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit_btn');
    $submit->setValue('Recover')->setDecorators(array(array('ViewHelper', array('helper' => 'formSubmit'))));


Produces...

 
    <pre class="highlight">


I couldn't set breakpoints and debugging this manually seems impossible.

Someone pointed out that you have to use setLabel() instead of setValue().

Isn't that very inconsistent from the way HTML works?! The is something completely different in this case while the value attribute is inside the tag. I mean, I can follow your reasons as of why you call it setLabel() vs setValue() but I would expect those two to do something totally different. Following your logic you require people to re-learn the vocabulary they are already used to. The API doesn't make sense in this case.

The functionality is the way it is to allow for a few things:

- First, as you noted, "label" is used as button values are for display purposes primarily
- Second, by using the label property, we can now test the submitted value to determine if this particular button was used to submit the form (using the isChecked() method).
- Third, if we used setValue() to specify this value, it could potentially change every time the form is submitted, which would be a bad user interface issue

I really could not come up with a better API for this to ensure all concerns were met.

Thanks for explaining how you came to your implementation. Appreciate it.
