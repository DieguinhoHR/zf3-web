### Description

It would be of additional value if Zend\_Loader provided some methods to modify the include\_path. The following methods have been part of my Zend\_Path proposal which has been rejected with the additional comment that the Zend-Dev team would like to add include\_path-modification methods to Zend\_Loader.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     /**
     * Sets the PHP include path to the given path(s).
     * The method returns the old include path.
     * 
     * Several arguments can be specified and will be assembled
     * to the new include path in the order specified.
     * Arguments can be strings or arrays of strings whereas
     * arrays will be handled like multiple arguments.
     *
     * @param  string|array $path,...
     * @return string
     */
    public static function setIncludePath($path)
    {
        if (func_num_args()==1) {
            if (is_array($path)) $paths=$path;
            else $paths=array($path);
        }
        else {
            $paths=array();
            foreach (func_get_args() as $arg) {
                if (is_array($arg)) $paths=array_merge($paths, $arg);
                else $paths[]=$arg;
            }
        }
        $includePath=implode(PATH_SEPARATOR $paths);   
        return set_include_path($includePath);
    }
    
    /**
     * Prepends the given path(s) to the current PHP include path.
     * The method returns the old include path.
     * 
     * Several arguments can be specified and will be assembled

     * Arguments can be strings or arrays of strings whereas
     * arrays will be handled like multiple arguments.
     *
     * @param  string|array $path,...
     * @return string
     */
    public static function prependIncludePath($path)
    {
        $paths=array();
        foreach (func_get_args() as $arg) {
            if (is_array($arg)) $paths=array_merge($paths, $arg);
            else $paths[]=$arg;
        }
        $paths[]=get_include_path();
        return self::setIncludePath($paths);
    }
    
    /**
     * Appends the given path(s) to the current PHP include path.
     * The method returns the old include path.
     *

     * arrays will be handled like multiple arguments.
     *
     * @param  string|array $path,...
     * @return string
     */
    public static function appendIncludePath($path)
    {
        $paths=array(get_include_path());
        foreach (func_get_args() as $arg) {
            if (is_array($arg)) $paths=array_merge($paths, $arg);
            else $paths[]=$arg;
        }
        return self::setIncludePath($paths);
    }

I can see the value of these functions, and Zend\_Loader seems like the right place to put them. Ralph, if you agree, can you work with Stefan to get the code in to trunk and close this issue?
