ZF-10615: Allow class callbacks in ContextSwitch Helper
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-10-30T12:02:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:39.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Unless you extends Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch, you cannot register callbacks that are part of a class (vs global function).

For example, it would be very useful to implement your callbacks in a Zend\_Application\_Resource object and then when adding contexts with Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch, you can pass both the callback name AND class name/instance to the callbacks parameter.

This would encourage encapsulation and discourage global php functions, which is the only way to add new contexts currently (besides extending Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch, which is rarely desirable).

The change would be easy enough...allow passing an array (callback name, class/instance) for the context callback, then add a few lines in ContextSwitch class, around line 301, to check if the method exists as part of the class/object.
