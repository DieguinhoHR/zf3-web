ZF-3182: Allow Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate to output escaped data automatically
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2008-04-26T10:01:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-05-09T12:29:38.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently, Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate does not escape data by itself, which means that you have to wrap its output in $this->escape() in the view, which is annoying and clutters up the view. The attached simple patch provides a convenient method to enable automatic escaping of the translated data. It is off by default for backward compatibility.

Why would it need to escape? Typically, data you are translating is coming from a trusted source, and the only time you'd want to escape is if the message string is coming from an unknown source -- which is not a good practice.

The data always needs to be escaped appropriately depending upon the output format. Sure, you could argue that the strings should be pre-escaped with XML entities in the source, but what if you're not outputting to an XML-based format, like JSON, or CSV, or SQL, or PostScript? This isn't to protect against unsafe input, it's to prevent invalid data from getting sent to the output in a more convenient manner.

I see also no need of escaping a translation.

If you are in need of any escaping then you should do this when generating the output and not at translation time.

This is really depreciated and against all I18N rules.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "this is really depreciated and against all i18n rules". Can you explain how this is not proper? The ability to auto-escape matches the attitude taken by other i18n systems in the past that I've used, such as smarty-gettext, so I can't imagine it's all that uncommon, and I don't know where else in the data model these strings would go since they're only used within the view. I am very interested in your opinion and rules regarding this matter. Maybe I'm just missing something, but I don't see it as breaking rules -- after all, these are View Helpers, which is the output stage. :)

A translation has to "translate" and must not modify the output.

Proper ways for allowing escaping are using a filter, or adding a Escape-View-Helper. Only because smarty does it not right does not mean that we also have to do this the false way.

Also when you create a output where you need escaping you would normally eighter integrate the escaping within your view or extend the class to provide the escaping you need.

As matthew already said... translation means to translate known values. Therefor you need no escaping. When you need to prepend XML entities you would have to do this within the view and not the translation helper.

Per comments, this practice is not necessary, as only trusted strings should be translated, and the translations themselves should be trusted.
