### Description

Using shortnames for methods of Zend\_Date which proxy the \_month() method add +1 year.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $d0 = new Zend_Date();
    $d1 = new Zend_Date();
    
    $d0->setYear(2000);
    $d1->setYear(2000);
    
    $d0->setMonth('January');
    $d1->setMonth('Jan');
    
    Zend_Debug::dump($d0->get(Zend_Date::YEAR));
    Zend_Debug::dump($d1->get(Zend_Date::YEAR));
    
    /**
    * Output : 
    * string(4) "2000"
    * string(4) "2001"
    */


I believe this to be due to the code in Zend/Date.php around line 3343 - 3355. It appears that arrays $monthlist and $monthlist2 are created, one containing full names, and then one containing abbreviated names. They are then merged together, and looped through to find a match. When a match is found $key + 1 is returned.

0-11 contain long names, January - December. 12-23 contain short names, Jan-Dec

So it seems that using short names results in a month number greater than 12, adding a year. I cannot determine if this was intentional, as code following the referenced block seems confusing to me, and much of Zend\_Date is quite dense. This may perhaps be some function of localization that I am not recognizing?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    *** Date.php    2009-06-28 20:18:29.000000000 -0400
    --- Date.Fix.php    2009-06-28 20:18:48.000000000 -0400

                      foreach ($monthlist as $key => $value) {
                          if (strtoupper($value) == strtoupper($month)) {
                              $found = $key + 1;
    +                       while($found > 12){
    +                           $found = $found - 12;
    +                       }
                              break;
                          }
                          ++$cnt;
