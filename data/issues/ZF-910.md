### Description

The new Zend\_Controller\_Action:\_forward method does not set dispatched to false the way the old one did.

As a result, if you have a preDispatch method in your controller that calls \_foward the system continues on with the dispatch it was trying to do[1], rather than going back into the dispatch loop and evaluating the new action/controller/module you specified.

[1] Zend\_Controller\_Action line 389/390

 
        $this->preDispatch();
        if ($this->getRequest()->isDispatched()) {


Coming out of preDispatch, isDispatched is still true, which lets the system in to run the existing action, instead of skipping it and firing up the new one.

I worked up a quick patch + test for this issue. It essentially does the same thing my production workaround does.. the patch just applies the setDispatched(false) inside the \_forward method instead of inside a custom method that calls \_forward then applies the setDispatched(false).

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
