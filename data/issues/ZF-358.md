i use this expression instead ..

return strlen($testedName)>3 && !preg\_match('/[[:digit:]]+|[[:punct:^-]]+/', $testedName)

[^-] allow only - as special char.

true, although the limitation of 3 charaters is not right. In Belgium we have names like "Jo", "An", "Bo", etc... Accents should be allowed.

The above validation is a little bit _loose_.

The following one would be more _strict_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    '/[^[a-zA-ZáéíóúàèìòùäëïöüâêîôûñçþæðÁÉÍÓÚÀÈÌÒÙÄËÏÖÜÂÊÎÔÛÑÇÞÆÐ]\\-\'áéíóúàèìòùäëïöüâêîôûñçþæðÁÉÍÓÚÀÈÌÒÙÄËÏÖÜÂÊÎÔÛÑÇÞÆÐ]/'

Oopz I mean:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    '/[^[a-zA-ZáéíóúàèìòùäëïöüâêîôûñçþæðÁÉÍÓÚÀÈÌÒÙÄËÏÖÜÂÊÎÔÛÑÇÞÆÐ]\ \-\']/'

Changing fix version to 0.9.0.

I've removed isName() until the approach can be better designed (if there really is a need). Locales create challnges, especially since a person's name can be based on many factors unrelated to the current web application (e.g., a person of German heritage using a French web site).
