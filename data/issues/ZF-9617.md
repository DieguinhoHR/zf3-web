### Description

I am noticing the Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket is crashing on a page which i think had a virus.

I am using this simple demo:

 
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.boxxtech.com/includes/get.asp?FID=3699">http://www.boxxtech.com/includes/get.asp?FID=3699</a>', array(
        'maxredirects' => 5,
        'timeout'      => 30));
    
    $client->request();


The application is crashing without possibility to recover itself (i removed absolute paths, keeping just what's necessary).

PHP Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in /...../ZendFramework-1.10.3/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php on line 423

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in /...../ZendFramework-1.10.3/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php on line 423

I think the target page is containing a virus but anyway, i guess this "behavior" is not good for Zend\_Http\_Client.

I am running PHP 5.2.13 and ZF 1.10.3 on a FreeBSD system...

I haven't tested with other adapters....

I tested with CURL adapter and got no crash.

This is definitely not related to the content of the page, and is almost definitely related to the fact that the server returns more than one Content-Length header.

Dupe of ZF-9404 which I will look into very soon
