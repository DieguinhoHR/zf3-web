### Description

In ZF 1.9 RC there is an attempt to fix the PHP 5.3.0 bug involving MYSQL\_ATTR\_INIT\_COMMAND not being defined. The fix replaces the constant with the value 1002. As commented in the PHP bug reports, this fix does not work on a Windows x64/MySQL 5.1.36/PHP 5.3.0 0 just an example. There is no longer a parse error but the effect does not occur.

The fix should attempt to run a SET NAMES command when first connecting to the database. This or wait for the PHP fix :)

Thanks!

For reference: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47224>

Propose that Pdp/Mysql.php follow the Pgsql.php implementation -- i.e., exec('SET NAMES'...) -- instead of lazy init.

I wouldn't advise that. The lazy init is a powerful feature. The implementation may be simpler (execute set names right after the connection is actually created (when needed)) Anyway, I believe they will address this issue in the PHP extension too (hopefully)

This problem occurs in pdo\_mysql in SO(windows).

the mysqli adapter without problems since it makes use of the function [mysqli\_set\_charset](http://br.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.set-charset.php).

Needs only set charset in configuration of the adapter.

This appears to be fixed in PHP 5.3.1+, if this is not the case, please reopen this issue.

Thanks, Ralph
