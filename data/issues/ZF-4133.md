ZF-4133: addTranslate() overwrites locale
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-30T03:30:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:39:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

The method addTranslation() in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter contains a bug at the end of the method which overwrites the previous locale. It checks whether the original locale is set with:

isset($translate[$originate])

However this is never true since the variable $translate does not exist. It should rather be

isset($this->\_translate[$originate])

Otherwise when performing a directory scan the locale will be set to the last one found during the scan.

When performing a directory scan the locale will never be set to the last one if you provide a locale yourself. The testbed would show such a behaviour.

The second clause will be checked anyway. There will only be a notice because of this problem, but no change in the behaviour of this class.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
