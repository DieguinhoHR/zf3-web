### Description

In an email thread, it was proposed to refactor Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client in an additional way, to separate the type-hinting code into a new utility class, Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client\_TypeHinting.

The objectives of this change are:

- Enable testability of type-hinting functionality. Unit tests (see ZF-372) should be able to cover type-hinting code.
- Improve readability of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client code.
