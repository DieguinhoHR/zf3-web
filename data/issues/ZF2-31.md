### Description

I wanted to try to make a form with a captcha. So, i created my element 'captcha' with the good parameters. To begin, it seems that the element captcha of the form wasn't updated when PluginLoader was renamed in PluginPrefixPathLoader. To continue, the same problem with the module captcha and ViewEngine... I tried to replace by Phprenderer but after that, the formHidden() is not any more found... I have enough knowledge in this module to go farther to my searches.

Captcha Element works after PR 374 about Form unit tests.
