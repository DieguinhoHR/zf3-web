### Description

Assuming url: /blog/view\_entry/title/My\_Very\_First\_Blog\_Post

This is not mapping to BlogController::viewEntryAction() as one would expect.

my request object looks like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Zend_Controller_Request_Http Object
    (
        [_requestUri:protected] => /blog/view_entry/title/My_Very_First_Blog_Post
        [_baseUrl:protected] => 
        [_basePath:protected] => 
        [_pathInfo:protected] => /blog/view_entry/title/My_Very_First_Blog_Post
        [_params:protected] => Array
            (
                [title] => My_Very_First_Blog_Post
                [controller] => blog
                [action] => view_entry
            )
    
        [_aliases:protected] => Array
            (
            )
    
        [_dispatched:protected] => 1
        [_controllerKey:protected] => controller
        [_actionKey:protected] => action
    )


The error I am recieving is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    exception 'Zend_Controller_Exception' with message 'BlogController::view_EntryAction() does not exist and was not trapped in __call()' in /home/ralph/projects/ralphschindler/application/library/Zend.php:266
    Stack trace:
    #0 /home/ralph/projects/ralphschindler/application/library/Zend/Controller/Action.php(242): Zend::exception('Zend_Controller...', 'BlogController:...')
    #1 /home/ralph/projects/ralphschindler/application/library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher.php(446): Zend_Controller_Action->__call('view_EntryActio...', Array)
    #2 /home/ralph/projects/ralphschindler/application/library/Zend/Controller/Front.php(666): Zend_Controller_Dispatcher->dispatch(Object(Zend_Controller_Request_Http), Object(Zend_Controller_Response_Http))
    #3 /home/ralph/projects/ralphschindler/htdocs/index.php(53): Zend_Controller_Front->dispatch()
    #4 {main}


_FIX_ I expect the problem is that both the formatControllerName and formatActionName both use \_formatName and thus are having to share the same naming convention function? If they both abide by the same nameing rules, perhaps changing the return line from:

line: 139: return str\_replace(' ', '\_', ucwords($unformatted)); to return str\_replace(' ', '', ucwords($unformatted));

That seems to work for me.

The fix for this issue broke controller naming, or perhaps it slipped through.

Please see: [http://nabble.com/Controller-Naming--tf2847594s161â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Controller-Naming--tf2847594s16154.html)

Was not sure if this should reopen or if a new bug should be filed. But either way, here it is ;)

Thanks, Ralph

Ralph -- let's connect on IM -- I'm curious what changed with the controller naming. With the current revisions, it does what was orginally intended, plus allows underscores so that you can use subdirectories ('/admin\_login' maps to 'Admin\_LoginController', which looks in 'Admin/LoginController.php', for instance). Send me an email with your IM details (matthew@zend.com is my email).

Resolved in revision 2840. Both word and path separators may now be configured via accessors in the dispatcher. By default, '-' and '.' act as word separators, and '\_' acts as a path separator. Dispatcher logic has been revamped and simplified to allow this.

Modules simply concatenate the module name with the controller name using an underscore, allowing directory segregation of controller classes.
