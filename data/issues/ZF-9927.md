### Description

The usage of the partial helper in the viewScript decorator means that it is impossible to provide a form in one module, and use it in another.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $renderedContent = $view->partial($viewScript, $vars);

No longer seems valid. correct notation is 'viewModule' as a param for the decorator.
