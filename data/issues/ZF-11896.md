ZF-11896: Unused variable $stream in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-11-16T20:14:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-11-21T20:55:40.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.11.12 (22/Jun/12)

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket::read() sets a variable $stream near the top of the method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $stream = !empty($this->config['stream']);


$stream is never used in the method; the actual logic that depends on whether or not streaming is being used checks against $this->out\_stream.
