### Description

The bug ZF-4032 shouldn't have been closed :

<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4032>

this query give me an error on the count throught the function getCountSelect :

 
        $query = parent::select(true)->setIntegrityCheck(false)->distinct(true)
            ->from(array('fu1'=>$this->_name), null)
                ->join(array('b'=>Model_Table_Blabla::$name), 'b.facebook_uid = fu1.facebook_uid', null)
                ->join(array('v'=>Model_Table_Vote::$name), 'v.id_blabla = b.id_blabla', null)
                ->join(array('fu2'=>$this->_name), 'v.facebook_uid = fu2.facebook_uid')
                    ->where('fu1.facebook_uid = ?', $array['facebook_user']->getFacebookUid());

When using the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DBselect() on a select statement as such;

$select = $this->db->select() ->from("IPLog", "DISTINCT(IP)");

or

$select = $this->db->select() ->from("IPLog", "IP") ->DISTINCT(true);

the counting of rows goes wrong, since in my case there's 2 unique IP's in the table, but I get 43 since there's 43 rows in total. This causes my paginator controls to show more pages then there really are. The problem seems to be that the count() method of the DBselect adapter resets the columns, without checking for result limitting expressions.

//update;

Thanks updating to latest svn and using the group by did the trick, doesn't work with 1.6.0RC2 though, so any change made after that did the trick.
