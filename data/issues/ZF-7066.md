ZF-7066: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube tests fail on a new account
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube tests expect that the account being used with them has been pre-populated with specific data.

This procedure is not documented anywhere.

These tests should be updated to auto-populate accounts if possible, otherwise comments should be added to TestConfiguration.php.dist.
