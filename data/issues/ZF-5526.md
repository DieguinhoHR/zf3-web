ZF-5526: findManyToManyRowset() causes "Unknown column x in 'where clause'" when using custom $select with where()

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findManyToManyRowset() uses correlation name 'i' (for $intersectionTable) and 'm' (for $matchTable) in $select query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from(array('i' => $interName))
                   ->joinInner(array('m' => $matchName), $joinCond)


If no $select has been provided to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findManyToManyRowset(), it uses the one from $matchTable:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($select === null) {
      $select = $matchTable->select();
    } else {
      $select->setTable($matchTable);
    }


Then a problem occurs when $matchTable's select() method has been overrided to had WHERE statement for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Db_Table_Abstract extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract {
      /**
       * Overrides Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::select() to add filter to the SELECT query: Don't wants logically-deleted rows in results
       */
      public function select ()
      {
        $select = parent::select();
        $select->where($this->getAdapter()->quoteIdentifier(($this->_schema ? $this->_schema . '.' : '') . $this->_name . '.logically_deleted') . ' = ?', 0);
        return $select;
      }
    }


(Which is my case, but I think it would be the same if a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select were provided to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findManyToManyRowset())

On a MySQL server I get: {quote}

1054 - Unknown column 'MATCHTABLE\_NAME.logically\_deleted' in 'where clause'
=============================================================================

{quote}

As I can't add WHERE clause (in my overrided Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::select()) after from() and joinInner() being called in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findManyToManyRowset()

I'm not sure how to fix that but I know that when removing correlation names 'i' and 'm' in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::findManyToManyRowset(), the MySQL errors disapears and result is as expected.

With the information provided, I cannot reproduce your error. It would be helpful if you could provide a schema and the minimal code to reproduce.

Additionally, some changes in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::select() have been made in recent versions (1.9.0+) and could potentially have affected the issue at hand. Please re-open if you can still trigger what you think to be the error.
