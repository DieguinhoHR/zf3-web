### Description

Zend\_Filter\_StripTags needs support to allow html comments. Currently, the whitelist only accepts tags.

Inside the following string, the comments should be honoured:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'Hello world '


 

 

### Comments

I have an idea about how this could be done. First swap all comments in the value with a unique identifier for each comment. Then process the value as normal. Finally swap the unique identifiers back with the comments stored at the start. Following is the two code blocks needed, the first at the start, the second at the end:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($keepComments === true) {
        // find comments
        preg_match_all('/<\!--.*?-->/ms' , (string) $value, $matches);
        // remove duplicate comments from the array
        $comments = array_unique($matches[0]);
        // replace each comment with a unique identifier
        foreach ($comments as $k => $v) {
            $value = str_replace($v, "ZFST$k", $value);
        }
    }
    
    
    if ($keepComments === true) {
        // replace the comment identifiers with their associated comment
        foreach ($comments as $k => $v) {
            $dataFiltered = str_replace("ZFST$k", $v, $dataFiltered);
        }
    }


This is the full methods code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function filter($value, $keepComments = false)
    {
        if ($keepComments === true) {
            // find comments
            preg_match_all('/<\!--.*?-->/ms' , (string) $value, $matches);
            // remove duplicate comments from the array
            $comments = array_unique($matches[0]);
            // replace each comment with a unique identifier
            foreach ($comments as $k => $v) {
                $value = str_replace($v, "ZFST$k", $value);
            }
        }
        
        // Initialize accumulator for filtered data
        $dataFiltered = '';        
        // Parse the input data iteratively as regular pre-tag text followed by a
        // tag; either may be empty strings
        preg_match_all('/([^<]*)(<?[^>]*>?)/s', (string) $value, $matches);
        // Iterate over each set of matches
        foreach ($matches[1] as $index => $preTag) {
            // If the pre-tag text is non-empty, strip any ">" characters from it
            if (strlen($preTag)) {
                $preTag = str_replace('>', '', $preTag);
            }
            // If a tag exists in this match, then filter the tag
            $tag = $matches[2][$index];
            if (strlen($tag)) {
                $tagFiltered = $this->_filterTag($tag);
            } else {
                $tagFiltered = '';
            }
            // Add the filtered pre-tag text and filtered tag to the data buffer
            $dataFiltered .= $preTag . $tagFiltered;
        }
        
        if ($keepComments === true) {
            // replace the comment identifiers with their associated comment
            foreach ($comments as $k => $v) {
                $dataFiltered = str_replace("ZFST$k", $v, $dataFiltered);
            }
        }
        
        // Return the filtered data
        return $dataFiltered;
    }


I tested the above with the following string:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <br></br> test 

` text `

     with  and 

The output was:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
     test  text  with  and 


The one issue I can see with this is if the value includes an identifier equal to that used to associate with the comments (ZFST + array key in the above example).

Hope this helps, John Baldock

Hey John,

I am doing pretty much the same - maybe a bit more straight forward towards my issue, yet I thought this should be added to the filter class (well not my cheap workaround, of course).

The string in question contains in my case since this is part of a wordpress-style function to allow people to add a "teaser" for their blog's homepage and "extended blog entry" when people click, "read more" into the same text field.

Anyway...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $str = 'jksajsa sajsaj sakjsaksa jsa salksa j saksjakjsa js lkjsalk jsa whatever';
    $str = str_replace('', '__ZF_IGNORE__', $str);
    // do filter stuff
    $str = str_replace('__ZF_IGNORE__', '', $str);
