Is this new currency symbol an existing symbol from the Unicode standard, or an entirely new character? If the character is an existing one, could you provide the unicode character code for it?

ZF 1.11 contains for INR the symbol: रु. ZF 2.0 contains for INR the symbol: रु. CLDR 1.8 contains for INR the symbol: रु. CLDR 1.9 contains for INR the symbol: रु.

All versions from ZF and also from the unicode project contains the same symbol for INR. Therefor I see no failure for now.

As always, when you think that are failures or problems within CLDR please open an issue at the unicode CLDR project to have it fixed there. ZF integrates CLDR for all locale informations.

See <http://cldr.unicode.org/index/bug-reports> for details.
