### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/26>

The Zend\_Db\_Table object should allow configuration of the Row object returned. Currently it's hard coded and it's difficult to create an extension object for the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object because of this. A protected property, such as $\_rowClassname could be set in any extensions of Zend\_Db\_Table that would allow a custom Row object to be returned.

This would allow Zend Framework to keep it's goal of being a base for an application, instead of being the application.

Good work so far guys. I'm drooling over this Zend Framework!

Here is my way to do this:

Add some static methods in Zend\_Db\_Table to change the Row object name and a static property to remember it. Change the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset to use Zend\_Db\_Table::getDefaultRowName() and create a object with that name instead of the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object.

Here is the patch:

sorry if this one is not valide, I'm not used to use the diff command and it's between svn and 0.1.3 version :( I think it's really simple and the teem smart enougth to do the changes by the hand if necessary 05/11/06 20:44:08: Modified by dev@zayso.org

Fully agree with the notion of being able to specify the row class. Should also be able to specify a class for returning a set of rows.

Disagree with the use of a static variable for the class name. I want different tables to return different types of rows.

I implemented this functionality using inheritiance: abstract class Mine\_Db\_Table extends Zend\_Db\_Table {

 
        protected $_rowClassName = 'Zend_Db_Table_Row'; protected $_rowsetClassName = 'Zend_Db_Table_Rowset';


class PersonTable? extends Mine\_Db\_Table {

 
        protected $_rowClassName = 'PersonRow'; protected $_rowsetClassName = 'PersonRows';


Seems to work well.

Now that 0.1.5 has been released I'm hoping that we can get some idea if some of these suggested enhancements will be added to the frame work. There has been at least two email threads on this enhancement which sort of indicates that people might want it. Or maybe DB\_Table is to be replaced by some sort of Active Record system?

I believe there are some important bugs (listed in our issue tracker) relating to the Zend\_Db\* classes that should be resolved before adding significant new functionality.

Currently, I think many would like a more Active Record like abstraction in the ZF, but want to avoid having to generate stub class code for every table in the DB, maintain complex logic/structure in configuration files, or create unique classes for every table participating in the group of tables mapped by these abstractions to an object-oriented API.

Such desires seem to imply reflection on database schemas using special case code for each database, caching the results efficiently, and algorithmically mapping data in the tables to object accessors/properties without precluding the interjection of subclasses to compute more complex object properties from available data. Reflection would require some degree of schema design-by-convention. Query aggregation, Unit of Work, lazy loading, and effective modelling of common object relationships and aggregations pose thorny problems for algorithmic mappings, especially when considering a single implementation that addresses all these concerns.

Hum... I understand that you want to close bugs before adding significant new functionality but IMHO : - it's a little patch (between 10 and 20 lines with comments included on 2 files) - there is no API break at all (because with default values, it's just work as now) - there is no new method (just two protected properties with good default values)

Even the manual won't have to be modified (if you don't want to describe the new features) !

IMHO, it's a very constructive and pragmatic patch : - People who wants a complete ORM mapping will be able to build a system upon Zend\_Db\_Table - People who prefers a lite system will be able to continue with current features (without extra code because the current way will continue to work without modification at all)

Of course, the complete and lite solution as you describe is not for tomorrow and will need a lot of reflection and work. That's why I think this patch (which is only a first step to show the path) has to be applied ASAP.

Regards

It'd be a better idea to use a protected function to get the return type instead of a protected property. By using a function, users could overload the function and return different types based on data from the result set, thus allowing Zend\_Db\_Table to be used with single table inheritance setups.

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

 

 

Posted by Bill Karwin (bkarwin) on 2007-01-05T17:06:25.000+0000

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

Bill,

When you say: "Changing fix version to 0.8.0.", do you mean that this will be fixed in 0.9.0?

Or, to put it another way. How likely is this bug likely to be fixed for ZF 1.0?

Regards,

Rob...

During the ZF 0.8 iteration, I fixed 37 bugs in Zend\_Db, but I concentrated on Zend\_Db\_Adapter and Zend\_Db\_Select issues.

I also wrote unit tests for Zend\_Db\_Table, Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row, and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset, to raise unit test code coverage from 0% to 100% on those classes. I felt this was prerequisite to working on the classes.

Now that we are in the ZF 0.9 iteration, I plan to address many issues in Zend\_Db\_Table and its companions.

As of revision 3995, Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row is now Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract, and likewise Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset is now Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract.

The Row and Rowset classes can be extended. The Zend\_Db\_Table recognizes keys in its options array 'rowClass' and 'rowsetClass', which name the user's choice for their custom Row and Rowset classes.
