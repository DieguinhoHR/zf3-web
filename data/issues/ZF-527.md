### Description

I created an index with the Lucene .NET implementation and get an Exception from Zend Framework about the limit size of Windows size file 2GB but my index file is about 8Mb. I can send you my index if you. I think the index binary file is incompatible.

PHP and Zend\_Search\_Lucene uses longs to position within files. Thus larges supported index file is 2Gb.

Large indexes may be used on 64-bit platforms.

It 's an issue to describe thisin a documentation

PS You may set upper bound for index auto-optimization. It's setMaxMergeDocs() method of IndexWriter in Java Lucene and setMaxMergeDocs() method of Zend\_Search\_Lucene object.

Take a look on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.index-creation.html#zend.search.index-creation.optimization) You should never optimize index in this case. Unoptimized index will have several segments. Each less then 2Gb.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

I've already heard three requests of large index support.

It's possible to limit segment merging (optimization) procedure in such a way that it will not merge segments if target may be greater than 2Gb.

It'll not help with large indices already prepared and _optimized_ with Java Lucene, but will close problem for Zend\_Search\_Lucene.

Update target fix version.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

If this is a documentation issue, it seems to have been resolved in the Zend\_Search\_Lucene-IndexCreation.xml file. Alex, if you have other ideas on how to address this, please create a new code feature or improvement issue.
