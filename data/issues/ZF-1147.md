### Description

When using this code I get a wrong result :

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2006-01-01', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    echo $date->get('Y'), '<br></br>'; // Result should be 2006
    echo $date->toString('YYYY-MM-dd'); // Result should be 2006-01-01


Display is : {quote} 2005 2005-01-01 {quote}

It seem to happen only on january 1

The described issue is not a problem just the use of the false constants. ;-)

When you look at the documentation for Zend\_Date

Chapter 8.5.3 Self defined output Formats with ISO. Table 8.16 Constants for ISO 8601 date output "Y - Year according to ISO 8601, at least one digit - Zend\_Date::YEAR\_8601"

From the ISO definition: The ISO year starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The ISO year number deviates from the number of the normal year (Gregorian year) on, if applicable, a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, or a Saturday and Sunday, or just a Sunday, at the start of the ordinary year (which are at the end of the previous ISO year) and a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, or a Monday and Tuesday, or just a Monday, at the end of the ordinary year (which are in week 01 of the next ISO year). For Thursdays the ISO year number is always equal to the ordinary year number.

Look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for details. If you are in need of the real year (y), and not the ISO year (Y) you should use ``` instead.

Hope this helps to see your problem ;-)
