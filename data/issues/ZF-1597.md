### Description

_Summary:_ When populating an instance of Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Who from XML, entryLink elements are not properly converted to instances of Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_EntryLink.

_Steps to Reproduce:_ 1. Create a new XML document containing a gd:who element and a nested gd:entryLink element. 2. Instantiate a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Who and populate it with the XML document created in Step 1.

_Expected Results:_ The gd:entryLink should be converted to an instance of Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_EntryLink and Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Who's entryLink property set appropriately.

_Actual Results:_ The gd:entryLink is created as a generic Zend\_Gdata\_Extension and added as an extension element to the Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Who instance.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r4993, affects 1.0.0 RC1 and RC2.

_Notes:_ A test for this will be included for this in ZF-1593.

Fixed in my build, patch sent to rboyd for review.
