### Description

There's a mistake in the doc for the $\_options var in the class Zend\_Translate\_Adapter. It is said for the option 'logUntranslated': "when true, untranslated messages are not logged". The word "not" should be removed.

I can not verify this mistake. Wether within the actual online documentation nor within svn.

The documentation reads: "When this option is set to TRUE, all message IDs which can not be translated will be written into the attached log"

This description is correct.

According to svn this text has not changed since more than 1.5 years.
