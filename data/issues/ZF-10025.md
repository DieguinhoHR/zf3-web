### Description

Hello,

looks like getVideoState only works for videos in draft state. One would expect it to return "deleted" for videos that are in deleted state.

Thanks, Jarek

Hi Ugo,

you are right, the PHP library code only returns state for videos in draft status.

$videoControl->getState()->getName()

will return the "deleted" status in your example.

I'll find out what drove this design decision since I agree it is not very convenient.

Thanks, Jarek Wilkiewicz, YouTube API Team
