ZF-5918: connect errors are supressed when dbname is provided

### Description

It seems a bit inconsistent that oci\_connect() errors are suppressed in \_connect() when dbname is provided in config.ini, but are not supressed when dbname isn't present.

It caused me a bit of head scratching during a recent connection issue.

In this case, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract will throw an exception with \_checkRequiredOptions():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Db_Adapter_Exception("Configuration array must have a key for 'dbname' that names the database instance")


Since SVN5014, this part of code is unused.

sorry, I wasn't very clear in the description.

inside the \_connect() function there is the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (isset($this->_config['dbname'])) {
                $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    $this->_config['dbname']);
            } else {
                $this->_connection = oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password']);
            }


at the moment a check is made to see if dbname has been declared somewhere, and if it has oci\_connect has it's errors suppressed (@). There is no error suppression when dbname has not been set.

This is an inconsistency, and caused me some issues while trying to diagnose a connection issue (The exception thrown contained no useful information)

I hope this is clearer.

You were clear, no problem ;).

Based on actual trunk, I think this code is unreachable. So we could replace:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($this->_config['dbname'])) {
        $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
            $this->_config['username'],
            $this->_config['password'],
            $this->_config['dbname']);
    } else {
        $this->_connection = oci_connect(
            $this->_config['username'],
            $this->_config['password']);
    }


by:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
        $this->_config['username'],
        $this->_config['password'],
        $this->_config['dbname']);


Because $this->\_config['dbname'] is mandatory, if it misses, then you have an exception thrown by Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_checkRequiredOptions() before entering in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle::\_connect()

I see what your saying. It sounds like a good idea to remove code which will never be run.

But the problem which I was having (with the empty Exception messages) will still occur in your replacement code, because you still have the @ suppressing error messages.

If you look at the next code block in the file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // check the connection
    if (!$this->_connection) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Oracle/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle_Exception(oci_error());
            }

sorry, I hit "Add" too soon.

the call to oci\_error() will never return anything while the oci\_connect() errors are suppressed.

So my suggestion is to remove the @ before oci\_connect.

{quote} the call to oci\_error() will never return anything while the oci\_connect() errors are suppressed. {quote}

For me, it's false, see these examples:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    oci_connect('user', 'good_password', 'database');
    print_r(oci_error());


=> return nothing
-----------------

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    oci_connect('user', 'bad_password', 'database');
    print_r(oci_error());


=>

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <br></br><b>Warning</b>:  oci_connect() [<a href="function.oci-connect">function.oci-connect</a>]: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied in <b>D:\web\www\test_oracle.php</b> on line <b>2</b><br></br>
    Array
    (
        [code] => 1017
        [message] => ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
        [offset] => 0
        [sqltext] => 
    )


- - - - - -


    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    @oci_connect('user', 'bad_password', 'database');
    print_r(oci_error());


=>

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [code] => 1017
        [message] => ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
        [offset] => 0
        [sqltext] => 
    )

The goal of @ is simply to suppress the warning but oci\_error() is always populated.

No?

It looks like I have misunderstood the purpose of @

In which case the exception thrown needs to contain at least the code and message, something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // check the connection
    if (!$this->_connection) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Oracle/Exception.php';
                $errorMessageArray = oci_error();
                throw new Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle_Exception($errorMessageArray[code] . ': ' . $errorMessageArray[message]);
            }


?

Open Zend/Db/Adapter/Oracle/Exception.php, you will see how this is managed

 

 

Posted by Steve Jordan (stevejordan) on 2009-03-11T02:29:59.000+0000

I see. That makes sense now.

So in my case the lack of an error message is down to oci\_error not returning one, rather than the framework's processing.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.

The unreachable code was removed with SVN 14324 to close this issue.
