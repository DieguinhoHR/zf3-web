### Description

Hello,

i'm missing something: There is no possibility to delete the attributes.

Example: The userId field becomes readonly after the form is first time saved successfully, or editing.... When starting the form, i can't know if it will be saved -> so i set it readonly. When checking the form, and where is an error, i add it this way f.x.:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->getElement('id')->addError('usernameAlreadyInUse');


But I cannot remove the "readonly" attribute at this time anymore

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->getElement('id')->removeAttrib('readonly');


From the other way it's possible: For every successfull write or editing, mark the field readonly

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->getElement('id')->setAttrib('readonly', 'readonly');


For this example the removeAttrib() would be easier.

In general there does not exist a "removeAttrib" except for displayGroup!

How is it then possible to remove the readonly attribute or another? Didn't found something for this case.

??How is it then possible to remove the readonly attribute or another? Didn't found something for this case.??

It's so easy:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    unset($form->getElement('id')->readonly);
    unset($form->getElement('id')->maxlength);
    // ...

Basil,

I've just taken a look at the patch, and I'd like to make a small suggestion, as it stands, you remove an attribute by simply setting it to null, so ideally, this method should use ->setAttrib($attrib, null) and not use the dynamic properties, and thus un-needed calls to \_\_get/\_\_set

Also, could you supply unit tests when supplying a patch like this?

The whole metadata (including attributes) is subject to change in the next major release (2.0), and there is a work-around available for this problem in the current version of Zend\_Form. Therefore i think this is not an issue.
