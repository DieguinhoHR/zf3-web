### Description

According to documentation, rewrite base (RB later ) should be set to the directory from where the index.php is loaded I did my tests with rewriting rules in httpd.conf and .htaccess, any url starting with /zf is rewrote to /zf/index.php unless file exist

I did my test in subdir called /zf

for url = <http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/>  
 RB is null, should be /zf

for url = <http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/param>  
 RB is null, should be /zf

for url = [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/param?bingo)  
 RB is null, should be /zf

for url = [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/param/index.php) (index.php doesn't exist here)  
 RB is [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/param/index.php), should be /zf

for url = [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action?test=index.php) (index.php doesn't exist here)  
 RB is <http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action>, should be /zf

for url = [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/index.phpold) (index.php doesn't exist here)  
 RB is [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/index.phpold), should be /zf

[http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/rolindex.php) RB is [http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/…](http://instdev2.dev.fdj.fr/zf/ctl/action/rolindex.php), should be /zf

Unless i misunderstood the rewriteBase, it could be set to

$\_rewriteBase = dirname(str\_replace($\_SERVER['DOCUMENT\_ROOT'], '', $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_FILENAME']));

Let's begin with your rewriteBase detection - it triggers 9 unit test failures.

First three should work while they don't on your configuration. What's your PHP version? What is your operating system and what is your webserver?

For 4-7 I will prepare a fix but let's resolve your problem first.

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-17T06:08:48.000+0000

Ok, failed test are becouse DOCUMENT\_ROOT is not set in tests. I'll look into this.

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-17T07:09:30.000+0000

Could you test something for me, Laurent? Test if it works - change rewrite detection in RewriteRouter constructor to this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $base = dirname(str_replace($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']));
    $base = rtrim(str_replace('\\', '/', $base), '/'); // windows and unix dirname
    $filename = basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
    if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $filename) !== false) {
        $base .= '/' . $filename;
    }
    $this->_rewriteBase = rtrim($base, '/');


Checking for filename is there for testing if RewriteEngine is off (it may be replaced by different code). Of course 4-7 will still not work. I will givie it a try on my Windows machine in a couple of hours - on Apache and IIS.

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-17T07:34:09.000+0000

I have optimized it a bit:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $base = str_replace($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
    if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])) === false) {
         $base = str_replace('\\', '/', dirname($base)); // windows and unix dirname
    }
    $this->_rewriteBase = rtrim($base, '/');

Forget exception... It come from a type in url test.

May I ask for another test?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $base = str_replace($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
    if (!strpos($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'], basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])) // for Apache config rewrite
        || strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']) === false) {
        $base = str_replace('\\', '/', dirname($base)); // windows and unix dirname
    }
    $this->_rewriteBase = rtrim($base, '/');

Following url still have RB set to /zf/index.php and then are misrouting to Index Controller instead of ctl Controleur

Where do you keep your RewriteRule directive? I know you said you have tested it in .htaccess and config files but I mean where you have kept it while testing the above code? I'll try to reproduce.

The problem is when you place RewriteRule in because $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is initialized incorrectly. But when you use it in .htaccess or all is well. Could you confirm it?

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-19T07:38:26.000+0000

And hopefully last code modification:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $base = str_replace($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
    if (isset($_SERVER['SCRIPT_URL']) // for Apache config  rewrite compatibility
        || strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']) === false) {
        $base = str_replace('\\', '/', dirname($base)); // windows and unix dirname
    }
    $this->_rewriteBase = rtrim($base, '/');


 

 

Posted by Laurent Taupiac. (titerm) on 2006-07-19T07:51:53.000+0000

Indeed, i did my first tests on both .htaccess and httpd.conf with a virtual host.

But, after, i was testing only in virtual host wich is my production configuration... My appologies for this mis-understood

I did test again on both.. Your right, the problem is only on virtual host. and $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is initialized to the user query instead of to rewriting query

I dont have time to finish this comment that you posted some new code... I tested it, and it s seem to work on both .htacess and virtual host now.

Nice job

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-07-21T05:06:07.000+0000

Please leave it open, I still have to commit it to svn. But first I have to test it on different setups.

 

 

Posted by Sergey Belov (arikon) on 2006-08-04T14:11:06.000+0000

what did you do with detectRewriteBase() ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function detectRewriteBase() {
        $base = '';
        if (!isset($_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) $base = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
        else if ($pos = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) {
            $base = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 0, $pos);
        };
        return rtrim($base, '/');
    }


this line is terrible, now rewrite base alway equals to REQUEST\_URI ```

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-08-04T14:18:10.000+0000

If there is no PATH\_INFO then you're at root application directory (on index.php) and then Request URI is your rewrite base.

If you're not on your root, then you've hit a bug - try moving RewriteRule from to or .htaccess.

 

 

Posted by Sergey Belov (arikon) on 2006-08-04T17:10:12.000+0000

Michael Minicki, you are not right, $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'] contains GET request string

detectRewriteBase() must be like this, it fixes the problem

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function detectRewriteBase() {
        $base = '';
        if (!isset($_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) {
            $filename = basename($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']);
            $base = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];
            if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $filename) === false) {
                // Default of '' for cases when SCRIPT_NAME doesn't contain a filename (ZF-205)
                $base = (strpos($base, $filename) !== false) ? dirname($base) : '';
            }
        }
        else if ($pos = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) {
            $base = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 0, $pos);
        }
        return rtrim($base, '/\\');
    }


 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-08-05T02:29:20.000+0000

Of course it contains GET URI. And for URL of '<http://localhost/test/index.php/archive/2006/05>' and '<http://localhost/test/archive/2006/05>' request URI is set to '/test/index.php/archive/2006/05' or '/test/index.php/archive/2006/05' and path info SHOULD be set to '/archive/2006/05'. It's not empty and is just subtracted from request uri leaving '/test/index.php' or '/test' as rewrite base.

If you request application root - '<http://localhost/test/index.php>' and '<http://localhost/test/>' then path info is not present and your reqest URIs are your rewrite bases - '/test/index.php' and '/test/'.

BUT! There is a bug (probably in php) which makes path\_info unreliable on certain conditions. It doesn't get initialized when it should. See:

<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38141> [http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi/…](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40102)

And check if this is your case.

PS. As I told you before - move your RewriteRules to htaccess and you'll see.

I'm getting unexpected results, too! The method 'detectRewriteBase()' is always returning '/activities/ssc' from the address '<http://www.client.dev/activities/ssc>'

This is the current $\_SERVER values:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        [SERVER_SOFTWARE] => Apache/2.2.0 (Fedora)
        [SERVER_NAME] => <a href="www.client.dev">www.client.dev</a>
        [SERVER_ADDR] => 10.0.1.250
        [SERVER_PORT] => 80
        [REMOTE_ADDR] => 10.0.1.250
        [DOCUMENT_ROOT] => /home/aaa/bbb/<a href="www.client.dev/docs">www.client.dev/docs</a>
        [SERVER_ADMIN] => root@localhost
        [SCRIPT_FILENAME] => /home/aaa/bbb/<a href="www.client.dev/docs/index.php">www.client.dev/docs/index.php</a>
        [REDIRECT_URL] => /activities/ssc
        [GATEWAY_INTERFACE] => CGI/1.1
        [SERVER_PROTOCOL] => HTTP/1.0
        [REQUEST_METHOD] => GET
        [QUERY_STRING] => 
        [REQUEST_URI] => /activities/ssc
        [SCRIPT_NAME] => /index.php
        [PHP_SELF] => /index.php
        [REQUEST_TIME] => 1154834871


The paths are set up as follows:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();
    $router->addRoute('activities',
       new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('activities/:action/:id/:sid',
          array('controller' => 'activities', 'action' => 'index', 'id' => 'index', 'sid' => ''),
          array('action' => '^\w+$', 'id' => '^\w+$', 'sid' => '^\w+$')));
    $router->addRoute('training',
       new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('training/:id/:sid',
          array('controller' => 'training', 'action' => 'index', 'id' => 'index', 'sid' => ''),
          array('id' => '^\w+$', 'sid' => '^\w+$')));
    
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $front->setRouter($router);
    $front->setControllerDirectory(PeptoCMS::path('app') . '/controllers');
    $front->dispatch();


I've noticed a few ways of determing the auto base url from above but these seem to give inconsistent results. For example $\_SERVER['DOCUMENT\_ROOT'] will only be set on an Apache webserver, not IIS.

What I can't understand is how useful this feature is - surely if you've set your rewriting for ANYTHING to resolve to /test/index.php and your URL is <http://www.client.dev/test/my/test> then the request URI will still always be /my/test - what sort of circumstances would provide different results?

                if (($pos = strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])) !== false) {
                    $base = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 0, $pos);
                }
            }
            return rtrim($base, '/');
        }

Michael Minicki, it seems to be a problem with apache 1.3.x only (i have this one on my dev server). $\_SERVER doesn't have PATH\_INFO key in all cases. But, it has key ORIG\_PATH\_INFO.

Here is my situation:

php runs as cgi

.htaccess contents

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !\.(swf)|(jpg)|(png)|(gif)$
    RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php5
    
    DirectoryIndex index.php5


doc\_root=/home/site/www/

bootstrap file in /home/site/www/somedir/index.php5

get request: <http://site/somedir/aaa/bbb/>

$\_SERVER contents

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(40) {
      ["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] => string(21) "w:/home/site/www"
      ["HTTP_HOST"] => string(9) "site"
      ["REDIRECT_REDIRECT_STATUS"] => string(3) "200"
      ["REDIRECT_STATUS"] => string(3) "200"
      ["REDIRECT_URL"] => string(15) "/somedir/index.php5"
      ["SCRIPT_FILENAME"] => string(36) "w:\home\site\www\somedir\index.php5"
      ["REQUEST_URI"] => string(18) "/somedir/aaa/bbb/"
      ["SCRIPT_NAME"] => string(15) "/somedir/index.php5"
      ["ORIG_PATH_TRANSLATED"] => string(36) "w:\home\site\www\somedir\index.php5"
      ["ORIG_PATH_INFO"] => string(15) "/somedir/index.php5"
      ["ORIG_SCRIPT_NAME"] => string(18) "/_php5/php-cgi.exe"
      ["ORIG_SCRIPT_FILENAME"] => string(27) "/usr/local/php5/php-cgi.exe"
      ["PHP_SELF"] => string(15) "/somedir/index.php5"
    }


 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-08-06T04:15:58.000+0000

Simon, I'll comment your example. If you set your rewriting for ANYTHING to resolve to /test/index.php and your URL is <http://www.client.dev/test/my/test> then you SHOULD have those variables set to:

REQUEST\_URI: /test/my/test PATH\_INFO: /my/test

I know it's not like that in your case but it's how it should be according to CGI specification. It's an Apache/PHP bug.

Guys, move your rules please. If you have set them like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
            ServerName test.intranet
            DocumentRoot /var/www/test/htdocs
    
            RewriteEngine on
            RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
            RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
            RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1
    


Just set them this way:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
            ServerName test.intranet
            DocumentRoot /var/www/test/htdocs
    
            
                    RewriteEngine on
                    RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
                    RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
                    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1


It works with Apache 2 this way. If placed directly under VirtualHost you have a problem with variables initialized incorrectly.

I would like to avoid hacking for avoiding other software bugs. If you insist on keeping your RewriteRules in the old place, then just use setRewriteBase for now. Set your bases accordingly - in your example, Simon, it should be set to '/test'.

I am waiting for PHP and Apache devs to come up with a solution. If they won't resolve it quickly, I will contact Zend and ask for their decision.

 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-08-06T04:18:26.000+0000

And for the inconsistent results and DOCUMENT\_ROOT not set on IIS. That's why I want to stick only to vars available in CGI specification. They should be supported by any web server which complies with it.

 

 

Posted by Simon Mundy (peptolab) on 2006-08-06T05:39:20.000+0000

Hi Martel - I'll give that a try and confirm that works.

However wouldn't the patch I provided still work in either case? If PATH\_INFO is not set, don't apply the base\_url. If it is, remove it from the REQUEST\_URI and it resolves correctly.

I don't have problems modifying my Apache configs, but perhaps there are some (albeit unlucky) users who are restricted by how much they can play with their config files.

 

 

Posted by Simon Mundy (peptolab) on 2006-08-06T05:54:05.000+0000

OK - Have just checked and (must have slipped my mind) but the Rewrite directives ARE already in the directory scope, not the virtualhost. Are the 'multiviews' likely to cause trouble with the PATH\_INFO? AcceptPathInfo is not set in either the global nor virtualhost scope.

Here's the config for clarity:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    DocumentRoot "/home/aaa/bbb/<a href="www.client.dev/docs">www.client.dev/docs</a>"
    ServerName <a href="www.client.dev">www.client.dev</a>  
    ServerAdmin webmaster@peptolab.com
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    www.client.dev/docs">
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all


 

 

Posted by Michal Minicki (martel) on 2006-08-07T03:36:42.000+0000

Simon, you can't ignore the rewrite base if path\_info is empty. If you have a file of /test/index.php and a URL of <http://localhost/test/> then CGI vars should be:

REQUEST\_URI: '/test' PATH\_INFO: '' (I guess Apache does not set it if it's empty)

So the rewrite base has to be '/test' and not '/'.

The problem is, whichever approch to detect rewritebase you choose you hit some problems. The code I have proposed to Laurent won't work with CGI version of PHP for instance (I mean CGI under Apache).

The current solution at least uses a standard and well documented variables.

I think it would be best if you could provide some feedback on PHP and Apache bug trackers. If the devs see the problem touches more than one person they may be motivated better:

<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38141> [http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi/…](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40102)

 

 

Posted by Mislav Marohni? (mislav) on 2006-09-04T10:09:09.000+0000

I've just moved a site from a host that had mod\_php to a one that runs it as FCGI, and have been hit by this issue. My routing was broken, and I don't even have a rewrite base because the site is in document root. The problem was that, instead of figuring out that rewrite base is an empty string, RewriteRouter thought rewrite base was the whole REQUEST\_URI because of this line:

if (empty($\_SERVER['PATH\_INFO'])) $base = $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'];

Now, I don't quite understand the whole background and complexity of this problem in different environments, but it should be obvious that the primary goal of detectRewriteBase() should be positively detecting that there is _no_ rewrite base when the site is in root. Detecting the rewrite base when there _really_ is a prefix only comes in second. What good is automatic detection of base when the same feature breaks routing if site is in root?

I recommend we move this issue completely _out_ of the core ZF components. Instead, I suggest using an empty string as the default rewriteBase, if no default is given in the ZF global "INI" (proposal coming soon).

Then, I propose moving all code (also see ZF-288) involved in detectRewriteBase() to an external ZF "configuration" script. The script would use Zend\_Environment, perform some tests, make a best guess for rewriteBase, store the guess into the ZF global "INI", and ask permission to submit the test results back to our new community server (more information on that server soon).

The test should be interactive, such the the user immediately sees and corrects any problems. Thus, test results submitted back to our data collection process on the community server should have a reasonable degree of accuracy.

Lastly, I suggest asking for volunteers to work together in creating the test script, data collection process, and work on analyzing the results and improving the test script.

One alternative to consider:

Use Zend\_Cache instead to seed the default value in the registry. If the rewriteBase has not been set, or the "signature" of the key $\_SERVER variables has changed, then load the source code for calculating rewriteBase, make the calculation, and store the result to Zend\_Cache. This would add Zend\_Cache as a required component for many "Hello World!" programs using the rewriteRouter, adding weight to even the simplest of ZF applications.

Another variation of the alternative above:

Use a global Zend "INI" file for caching a small number of super simple auto-generated things, like a calculated rewriteBase, thus avoiding requiring Zend\_Cache.

Rewrite base detection (and handling) was recently moved to Request class (with a major rewrite to whole Controller module). At the time of writing modified code is evaluated in the incubator.
