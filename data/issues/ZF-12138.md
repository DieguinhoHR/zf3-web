### Description

Validator of email addresses is processing "!qa@rightfusion.com", "qa!@rightfusion.com", "qa!.maksim@rightfusion.com", "qa.!maksim@rightfusion.com" addresses like wellposed addresses. But it doesn't matches RFC 2822 (3.2.4), because symbol "!" should not be in the early part of the local part, in the end the local part of or near the the symbol "." .
