ZF-11831: Form's default translator incorrectly passed to subforms, causing override of subform elements' default translators

### Description

If a form is validated, the translator of the form will be passed through all subforms. It's the same bug as ZF-9330 (for form elements) which was resolved long ago except that subforms were left out while fixing.

Only add "$this->hasTranslator()" in Form.php line 2261 (1.11.11) as it was done in line 2246 for elements

 
        foreach ($this->getSubForms() as $key => $form) {
            if (null !== $translator && $this->hasTranslator()
                    && !$form->hasTranslator()) {

The Form/SubForm case is a special one. As a Form and an Element are completely separate entities, they can each have their own default translators (set via setDefaultTranslator method). However, SubForm is a sub-class of Form, and since the default translator is stored in a static class variable of Zend\_Form, all forms and sub-forms share the same default translator. Determining an element's translator is a four step process:

If a validator was set with setValidator, return it.
====================================================

If no validator was set, but a default validator was set with setDefaultValidator, return it.
=============================================================================================

If no default validator was set either, look up the key Zend\_Validate in Zend\_Registry and return it.
=======================================================================================================

If no key Zend\_Validate exists in Zend\_Registry, return null
==============================================================

The only case where your suggested addition would make an impact is when $this->hasTranslator() is false while the two existing conditions are true. In this case, $translator contains the default translator instance, and that instance is passed down to all the sub-forms. Since all forms (both Form and SubForm) always have the same default translator definition, that's not a problem. I've attached a patch with a unit test showing this behaviour.

Unless you can provide a specific example where the existing behavior is a problem, I will recommend that this issue be closed as "Not an Issue".

Let me try to explain:

during initalisation I'm setting up two translation objects: "Zend\_Registry::set('Zend\_Translate', $translate)" [1] to my own Tramslate Object and setting a Default Translater for Validate: Zend\_Validate\_Abstract::setDefaultTranslator( $validateTranslation ); [2]

If a form exists with 2 elements and an additional subform with 2 elements (all 4 elements with a float validator for example) the error message of the elements of the form are translated by [2 - Default Translator of Zend\_Validate] while the elements of the subform are translated by [1, cause the default Validation Translator is overwritten by the subform translator]

@Bjoern:

Aha! I figured I was missing the point, but I couldn't see where at the time. The attached test (ZF-11831\_v2.patch) should reproduce the issue you are seeing. The result when I run it against trunk is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    There was 1 failure:
    
    1) Zend_Form_FormTest::testElementsOfSubFormReceiveCorrectDefaultTranslator
    SubForm element received wrong validator
    Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
    --- Expected

    -Element
    +Default


After adapting the fix applied in ZF-9364 for elements to this case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

             foreach ($this->getSubForms() as $key => $form) {
    -            if (null !== $translator && !$form->hasTranslator()) {
    +            if (null !== $translator && $this->hasTranslator()
    +                    && !$form->hasTranslator()) {
                     $form->setTranslator($translator);
                 }
                 if (isset($data[$key]) && !$form->isArray()) {


The failing test above passes, as does the entire Zend\_Form suite.

Thanks for your help and patience in sorting this issue out!
