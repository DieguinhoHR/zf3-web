### Description

This will allow for easily setting row classes based on a common naming convention, eg:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    abstract class My_Db_Table_Abstract extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        protected function _setup()
        {
            parent::_setup();
            $this->_setupRowClass();
        }
        
        protected function _setupRowClass()
        {
            if (class_exists($class = get_class($this) . '_Row')) {
                $this->_rowClass = $class;
            }
        }
    }

But doesn't this depend on the rowClass being available at the time of instantiation? Or are you envisaging a 'require\_once' within your table definition to have this class definition pre-loaded?

I'd recommend something more reliable... like, say, a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Plugin to set this during an init() event ;)

Well yes, it would rely on the rowClass being available during instantiation, but then in most cases the auto loader would include it when the class\_exists is run. But then, this might not necessarily have to rely on the class being loaded. I didn't see the implementation of \_setupRowClass above as the default, it's simply a method you can override if you wish to set the row class in a consistent manner across all tables, rather than setting the \_rowClass property manually in every table class. In exactly the same way we already have \_setupTableName.

This is of course something that could be done with a table plugin (once that's ready :) ), as the whole purpose of the plugin proposal is to remove the need to extend Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract with another abstract class implementing custom logic, and you could say exactly the same about \_setupTableName.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This issue has gone unaddressed for too long. I'm reassigning this to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

Not sure if this is the solution we want, but the feature is linked (in a round about way) to another feature request

I think between the concrete instantiation coming in 1.9 and the Zend\_Application autoloader from 1.8, I think we having this feature in place.
