ZF-8068: Redirector::setGotoSimple() always uses default route
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-13T13:19:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-09-17T19:29:29.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Inside setGotoSimple() a route is assembled with $router->assemble($params, 'default', true). This makes the assumption the module/controller/action structure is always used. When using non default routes, the redirector cannot assemble the url.

Proposal is the try/catch block which is used inside Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite::assemble itself: $router = $this->getFrontController()->getRouter(); try { $name = $router->getCurrentRouteName(); } catch (Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Exception $e) { $name = 'default'; } $url = $router->assemble($params, $name, true);

I will attach the patch and unit test results asap.

gotoSimple() was primarily engineered for use with the default route shipped with ZF. The 'default' route is a "reserved" route name, if you will.

Additionally, gotoSimple() is intended to work when you have several routes in play. The patch as you propose above will not work, as it would falsely error when the route name is not 'default' but a 'default' route is still registered.

I'd argue that if you are _not_ using the standard default route shipped with ZF, you shouldn't be using gotoSimple(), but instead be using gotoRoute().

Mm, I had some use cases why gotoSimple was valid. But at the moment I can do whatever I want with gotoRoute(), because it is valid to leave the name of the route null.

Sorry, you can close the issue for invalid :)

Closing per comments.

I would to change 'default' to null. It makes more sense that the current route is being used (which could be 'default'). Since gotoSimple is also used in the direct method, it is a waste of code this way. Many applications use routes besides the default one. Most common call will be to use the current route.
