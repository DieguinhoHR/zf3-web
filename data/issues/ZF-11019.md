### Description

When caching URIs with "0" (0-digit) as the file name (eg. example.com/a/b/0) Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Static changes file name to the one set with "index\_filename" property. Is`s because "empty" function is used in order to determine whether file name is set (thus being considered as directory index):

if(empty($fileName)) { $fileName = $this->\_options['index\_filename']; }

Code below fixes this issue:

if (strlen($fileName) === 0 || '/' === $fileName) { $fileName = $this->\_options['index\_filename']; }
