### Description

Hello,

With Zend 1.7.3, when I execute a sql query on a table which has a date field and a text field then the returned date is corrupted. When I change the text field to a varchar field, it works fine. If I copy Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli.php from Zend 1.5.0 to Zend 1.7.3 then it works fine.

Here is a test scenario: Create the database named "space" with a single table in it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE `test_table` (
      `id` int(7) NOT NULL auto_increment,
      `login` varchar(20) NOT NULL default '',
      `birthdate` date default NULL,
      `abc` text NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
    ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=2 ;
    INSERT INTO `test_table` VALUES(1, 'atm', '2009-01-06', '');


With this small piece of code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?
    require_once '/var/www/zend/library/Zend/Loader.php';
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
          $params = array('host'=>'localhost', 'username'=>'test', 'password'=>'test, 'dbname'=>'space');
          $db = Zend_Db::factory('Mysqli', $params);
    
          $select = $db->select()->from('test_table')->where('login=?', 'atm');
          $stmt = $db->query($select);
          $result = $stmt->fetchAll();
          Zend_Debug::dump($result);
    ?>


We can see that the "birthdate" field is corrupted. The output of the php code is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(1) {
      [0] => array(4) {
        ["id"] => int(1)
        ["login"] => string(3) "atm"
        ["birthdate"] => string(10) "2-@n"
        ["abc"] => string(0) ""
      }
    }
    
    zend_mm_heap corrupted


Here is my PHP and MySQL versions: PHP 5.2.3 (cli) (built: Dec 5 2007 17:14:53) Copyright (c) 1997-2007 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2007 Zend Technologies

mysql Ver 14.7 Distrib 4.1.7, for pc-linux (i686) Copyright (C) 2002 MySQL AB

I have also tested with PHP 5.2.8 and I get the same behavior.

Maybe I have done something wrong ? Can you please give us your opinion ?

Thanks, Anh Tuan.

Tested with ZF Trunk, PHP 5.2.3 and Mysql 4.1 in a 32 bit Linux VM and could not reproduce this. The fact that a zend\_mm\_heap\_corrupted is reported is indicative of a segmentation fault or similar issue that would be near-impossible to reproduce from system to system unless the issue is at the language level rather than the framework level. The fact that changing from a text to a varchar solved the problem at that point further illustrates the point, as the difference there at the driver level could easily push it in or out of segfault range. A quick scan of of the PHP bug tracker didn't reveal anything relevant or related.

Similar issues have been raised with PHP itself with various vendor databases in the past.

Ideally, you can produce a PHP only reproduction for the PHP team and they can look into it.
