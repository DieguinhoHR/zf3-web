What exactly is getReturn(), what purpose does it serve?

It gets the return type of the method. It's implemented by Zend\_Reflection\_Function (which Zend\_Reflection\_Method is meant to follow, bar getDefiningClass() ). One of the examples also uses it. (Trouble is you run the example and, obviously you get a fatal error.)

If it were not for following Zend\_Reflection\_Function, getReturnType() might be better but I think in context it is clear enough.

Hello. Attached is a patch with the method implemented. It also includes a unit test.
