What is the status on this issue? Kevin, feel free to commit to trunk and test yourself after getting approval from Darby or one of the other team members. If no one else can do it, I'll look at it for you. Thanks for the contribution!

That patch will be very outdated - now Services are getting poked again I'll sort out something against trunk and go from there. I'll try to get it done quickly but I'm snowed under (not literally thankfully - too much travelling to want white stuff everywhere) just now.

This brings up my local patches to apply cleanly against trunk.

Sorry, I slipped up with a copy/paste boilerplate for the header on a file with the last patch. Ignore it and try this instead.

Tests fine locally.

Kevin, is committing these patches, along with unit tests and updates to the documentation, something you would be interested in doing? If so, please let me know, and I'll set you up with SVN commit access. :)

Go on then, sign me up as a fully fledged member and I'll try not to break anything :-)

I've sent your SVN credentials via e-mail; thanks for your support! :)
