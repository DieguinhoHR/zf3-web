### Description

Class Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Abstract function write($event)

Zend\_Log\_Writer doesn't test all filters before reject the message.

How to test it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $logger = new Zend_Log();
    
    $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Stream('<a>php://output</a>');
    $logger->addWriter($writer);
    
    $filter1 = new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority(Zend_Log::EMERG, "==");
    $writer->addFilter($filter1);
    
    $filter2 = new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority(Zend_Log::INFO, "==");
    $writer->addFilter($filter2);
    
    // blocked but should not !
    $logger->info('Informational message');
    // blocked but should not !
    $logger->emerg('Emergency message');
    
    // blocked - ok
    $logger->debug('Debug message');


Patch: Function write in class Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Abstract

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Log a message to this writer.
     *
     * @param  array     $event  log data event
     * @return void
     */
     public function write($event)
     {
         foreach ($this->_filters as $filter)
         {
                   if ($filter->accept($event))
                   {
                          // exception occurs on error
                          $this->_write($event);
                          break;
                    }
         }
     }


(!) Function log from Zend\_Log class shoud be rewrite (near line 140) in the same way.

No news for over a month.

Change priority to Major.

Affects Version 1.9.6 and 1.9.7 In addition, maybe the priority level should be change to critical (loss of data).

As per: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.filters.html) {quote} When you add one or more Filters to the Log object, the message must pass through all of the Filters before any Writers receives it. {quote}

Therefore, when you filter the way you did, the error must both be Zend\_Log::EMERG and Zend\_Log::INFO at the same time.

Currently, Zend\_Log\_Filter doesn't support an "Or" filter.

Another way to handle it is to filter for all the priorities you do not want.
