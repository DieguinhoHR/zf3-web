### Description

I think [Zend\\Locale\\Data\\Intl](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Locale/Data/Intl.php) has no unit tests. We can see that there are references to Locale and ZFLocale (an alias of Zend\\Locale\\Locale in the import).

Closing as non-issue.

Zend\_Locale 2.0 is in development. Intl can actually not be used as long as Cldr and the Abstract class is not finished or ready for production.
