### Description

When I upgraded to Zend 1.8, a new issue arose. The call to inet\_pton() in line 62 fails when attempting to validate "localhost". I know the error is suppressed and I can set my error handler to ignore it, but it still seems like it would be a common error to incur. It seems like it would be a better solution to avoid the error entirely since "localhost" should be regarded as valid

But "localhost" is not a IP adress. It's a hostname. Your rule would also apply to "yahoo" being "213.44.23.16" for example.

And when I define that localhost should point to another IP adress (which is theoretically possible) then your rule would not match anymore.

I see this problematic. And the generic rule is: When you want to check a hostname then use Zend\_Validate\_Hostname and for a IP adress Zend\_Validate\_Ip.

Hostname can also check IP adresses and you can limit the check to the rules you need.

I agree with your logic.The issue arose when attempting to send an email. Maybe the issue would be better resolved if the Zend\_Mail class (or whichever class eventually calls Zend\_Validate\_Ip) were to test the value against a regex to determine if it's a hostname or ip address and then validate accordingly.

Closing as non-issue.

When you still think it's a problem of Zend\_Mail, then please add a new issue with some reproducable code and description so maintainers for Zend\_Mail can take a look.

Additionally please note that in this case the error-supression is the only possible way to prevent the output of notices by inet\_pton.
