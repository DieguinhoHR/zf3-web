ZF-12529: Zend\_Mail function \_formatAddress not following RFC2822
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2013-02-22T14:25:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2013-04-05T16:06:58.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When the name in the From address contains a dot, the name should be enclosed in double quotes. Although the code checks a lot of characters that require the quotes ( ()<>[]:;@\\, ), the dot is missing.

The fix is obvious and simple: Just add a dot to the string on line 1267 (version 1.12.1) in Zend/Mail.php.
