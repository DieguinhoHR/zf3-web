ZF-9967: Can't disable locale in IBAN validator

### Description

You can't disable the locale detection in Zend\_Validate\_Iban when using a Zend\_Config (xml).

In xml you need to specify false with a zero.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Iban0

but because the validator checks also the type, you can't disable it.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if ($locale !== false) {
        /* some code */
      }


It works for me by changing the controle to (without type checking)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if ($locale != false) {
        /* some code */
      }

and why don't you use "auto"?

Hello Thomas Could you explain how I can configure the validator with xml? From what I see, everything what I can think of just reads the locale out of the registry. So if I use the config from my original post, I fall in the check

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (empty($locale)) {
        require_once 'Zend/Registry.php';
        if (Zend_Registry::isRegistered('Zend_Locale')) {
           $locale = Zend_Registry::get('Zend_Locale');
        }
     } 


and because that key is defined in my registry, it use that but that is just what I want to avoid.
