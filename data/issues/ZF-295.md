### Description

Lucene is meant to normalise the score values retrieved from a query. Can this be implemented in Zend\_Search?

Do you mean normalizing scores for the case when largest score is greater than 1.0?

It was my understanding that normalisation would occur for all non-empty result sets, with the best match(es) earning a score of 1.0 and the rest somewhere below that.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

No, Java Lucene normalizes result only if best score is greater than 1.0.

Nevertheless it should be implemented for Zend\_Search.

Other possibility to affect scoring and score normalization is to define your own Similarity implementation.

Done.
