ZF-5669: JQuery Autocomplete incorrect parameters
-------------------------------------------------

### Description

According to the JQuery documentation the AutoComplete plugin needs two parameters (url|data, options). The ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_AutoComplete autoComplete function encodes the url|data parameter into an array including the options which fails to work once rendered (Tested on Safari and Firefox)

AutoComplete plugin documentation [http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/â€¦](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete/autocomplete#url_or_dataoptions)

In order to get it to work I had to make the following changes

{panel} require\_once "Zend/Json.php"; $data = Zend\_Json::encode(isset($params['data']) ? $params['data'] : $params['url']); unset($params['data']); unset($params['url']); $params = Zend\_Json::encode($params);

 
        $js = sprintf('%s("#%s").autocomplete(%s, %s);',
            ZendX_JQuery_View_Helper_JQuery::getJQueryHandler(),
            $attribs['id'],
            $data,
            $params
        );


{panel}

NOTE: Adding to description because I suddenly cannot post Comments.

Plugin is <http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete>. I couldn't find reference to the correct plugin in the Zend Framework manual (which is likely explained that is was part of 1.6RC but has now been removed)

which jQuery UI version are you using? They kicked AutoComplete out in the last RC so i can't really support it any more until they stabilized the API and schedulded it for UI 1.7 release.

Closed issue due to the usage of a jQuery plugin not the original jQuery UI widget.
