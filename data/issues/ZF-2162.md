ZF-2162: Zend\_Config\_Xml usage without sections bug
-----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-11-06T22:39:44.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-12-15T21:46:38.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.3 (30/Nov/07)

### Description

It appears the Zend\_Config\_Xml class does not differ from a SimpleXMLElement that contains children vs on that does not (eg a string) when not using sections.

For instance:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Xml('ourFile.xml', null);


This would load everything under the root element without the use of sections, but because of this bug, it will set any 1st level element within the root element that is a string to an empty Zend\_Config object instead of a string which is expected.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ../applicationbar

The following would be accessed like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $config->home; // Errors out because it contains an empty Zend_Config obj;


Attached is the patch

ok attaching the file...

The bug would happen on access to home and throw\_exceptions since they are 1st level elements
