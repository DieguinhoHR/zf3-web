### Description

In section 46.3.2. "Search Results" of the Reference Guide chapter on Zend\_Search\_Lucene is the following quote:

??Each of these has two properties: $hit->document is a document number within the index and $hit->score is a score of the hit in a search result.??

$hit->document should be $hit->id.
