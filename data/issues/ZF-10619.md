### Description

Sorry to bother, but I see the old revision (#21759) is still being shipped with 1.11 rc1, and I wanted to update it since way more of 10% strings have changed.

I should attach revision #22668 here, I hope this is the right procedure to post it.

No way, I can't find how to attach a file to this sub-task. Anyway it's online at [http://194.177.98.73/Zend\_Validate.php.gz](http://194.177.98.73/Zend_Validate.php.gz) ...

I fixed all errors but #39, since i can't find where the string is supposed to be in the english file.

I searched in revision #22668 both from current release (1.11.2) and from trunk, but I can't find that string (nor anything which contains "valid URI hostname" for that matter). Am i looking at the wrong revision? Anyway if requested I can add it (I guess to the Zend\_Validate\_Hostname section).

Also, how can I attach the new file?

Eighter attach the new file, or the changes as patch to this issue or the patch alone as comment

{quote} This was reported in ZF-10907. {quote} Ok, I added the invalid hostname string, and advanced the revision number to 22830.

{quote} Eighter attach the new file, or the changes as patch to this issue or the patch alone as comment {quote} It looks like I'm not autorized to attach a file (either because this is a sub-issue or because there already is an attached one). I'm not sure which version the patch should be from, so I uploaded the file again on my server: [http://194.177.98.73/Zend\_Validate.php.gz](http://194.177.98.73/Zend_Validate.php.gz)
