### Description

Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim::\_unicodeTrim has a problem with multibyte string.

This problem is fixed in Related issue [ZF-7023](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7023), but incomplete.
==================================================================================================================

When the multibyte character string of UTF8 is used, it is necessary to specify "u" qualifier in the preg\_replace function of PHP. So it works correctly by adding "u" to 1st parameter of preg\_replace.

This issue seems to happen only in Japanese for me.

Akihiro, do you confirm to happen on other languages? For example, Chinese, Korean.

( And Thai also might have same problem)

If Chinese and Korean have same solution, we could make a model of Zend\_filter\_Alpha for changing several expressions and using them.

Fixed with GH-107

Certainly, it happens in Japanese. In Korean and Chinese, the same problem was not able to be confirmed (Though the confirmation might be not enough).

However, I was embarrassed as a Japanese user, and I am glad of fix.

Thank you.

Zend Framework minimal version 1.11.11 Same error. Version of the StringTrim.php yonger than the message about fix - \* @version $Id: StringTrim.php 23775 2011-03-01 17:25:24Z ralph $

Preg\_replace - return preg\_replace("/$pattern/sSD", '', $value); - without latter u

Reopen, because this fix is not applied to ZF1 trunk & 1.11.11. And "u" qualifier patch is not correct.Please see ZF2-170 <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-170>

I do not think /u switch resolves this issue, because the "Fullwidth Space" is not based on international rule, but Japanese specific rule.

I think if we would make this filter fit for Japanese, It will be necessary to make conditional branching by locale as following, or to make new inherited class.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_locale = new Zend_Locale('auto');
    
    switch ($this->_locale->getLanguage()) {
        case 'ja':
            //Japanese specific rule
            $chars = preg_replace...;
            $pattern = ...;
            return preg_replace...;
        break;
    /*
     if there would exist another character system, it would fall on here in future.
      case 'xx':
          ...;
        break;
    */
      default:
          //original statement
            $chars = preg_replace...;
            $pattern = ...;
            return preg_replace...;
        break;
    }


Thanks.
