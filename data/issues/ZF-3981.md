This is only true for windows.

In \*nix there is a difference if a file is named a.gif or a.GIF... these are two files. Because this adapter is not designed for HTTP only the solution is not just to lowercase all extensions !!!

Behaviour changed with r10985. Default is case insensitive, can be changed to sensitive by parameter.
