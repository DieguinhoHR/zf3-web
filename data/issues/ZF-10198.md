### Description

The documentation for Zend\_OpenId\_Provider is very confusing and not useful.

I have an existing website that I want to turn into an OpenID provider. All my user accounts are stored in a mysql table.

I figured since an OpenID is represented as a URL, I am going to do something like: <http://login.mydomain.com/username>

I've setup a subdomain, and created an htaccess that redirects all URLs to /login.php?username=[username]

The way I see it, and tell me if I'm wrong, someone goes to let's say StackOverflow, they enter <http://login.mydomain.com/myUsername>. They get to a page on my server that asks for their password (since I already know their username), I check that it matches, and return the key?

People online recommended using Zend\_OpenId\_Provider. I've been reading the documentation ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.openid.provider.html)), but I find it very confusing. There is no real world example where the user login/password are stored in a database.

It seems to be a pretty common thing to do.

See original question on StackOverflow: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3208905/…](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3208905/creating-a-openid-provider-in-php)
