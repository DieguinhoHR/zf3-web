### Description

I'm trying to use the Barcode bundle (standalone) and am managing my requirements using Composer.

While the loader bundle HAS been installed locally. I'm getting an exception telling my the the Zend/Loader file is missing.

I can see here..

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/library/Zend)

That this file is actually outwith the scope of the individual bundles (in the root of the libraries folder). How would one load this file using composer? Is the only way to use this file to install the entire framework? Can't this file be moved into the loader bundle?

Exception is

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\\Loader' not found in /vendor/zendframework/zend-validator/Zend/Validator/Barcode.php on line 106
