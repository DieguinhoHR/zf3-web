### Description

Im using File backend for Zend\_Cache like this:

resources.cachemanager.file.frontend.name = Core resources.cachemanager.file.frontend.options.lifetime = 7200 resources.cachemanager.file.frontend.options.automatic\_serialization = true resources.cachemanager.file.backend.name = File resources.cachemanager.file.backend.options.cache\_dir = "C:\\Temp\\"

When I call Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File::clean with CLEANING\_MODE\_ALL, all cache files are deleted correct but return value is false.

You can reproduce it storing something in cache and then call Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File::clean() and var\_dump the result. It will be bool(false)!

I have the same problem with Zend\_Cache from ZF version 1.11.11.

The problem occurs when the \_clean method in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File tries to remove the metadata file first.

Example:

the cache file is called "zend\_cache---testClean" and the metadata file is called "zend\_cache---internal-metadatas---testClean".

The glob function returns the files in alphabetic order

first "zend\_cache---internal-metadatas---testClean" second "zend\_cache---testClean"

\_clean removes "zend\_cache---internal-metadatas---testClean" and tries to remove its metadata file which of course doesn't exists, because it is already a metadata file. Because of the non existing metadata file the remove method returns false, although the file is deleted.

In the second step he tries to delete "zend\_cache---testClean" and its metadata, but the metadata file is already deleted in the first step, so remove also returns false.
