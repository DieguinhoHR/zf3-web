ZF-10569: Impossible to set view suffix through application.ini

### Description

While it is possible to set layout suffix in the config passed to Zend\_Application, it is not possible to set view suffix in the same way.

For example, this works (in application.ini)

resources.layout.viewSuffix = php

But this has no effect:

resources.view.suffix = php

So it is impossible to set the view suffix from the application config, and using Zend\_Application, it is difficult to set it in other ways, such as using Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getExistingHelper('viewRenderer'); and then setting the view suffix...because the ViewRenderer is not immediately registered when the application is created, and if you register it yourself, it seems to get overwritten by the app.

It would be great to set suffix in the config file...especially since we can do it with layouts.
