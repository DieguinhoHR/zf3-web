### Description

TK Sung writes:

I'm getting 302 (moved temporarilly) is received, and Gdata:delete is throwing an exception instead of handling the redirect.

Also Zend\_Gdata::delete() throws a Zend\_Feed\_Exception in certain circumstances, because it does not catch it, and the API doc does not document that it may throw such an exception. Zend\_Gdata::delete() should catch the exception and translate it into one of the Zend\_Gdata\_\*\_Exception's.
