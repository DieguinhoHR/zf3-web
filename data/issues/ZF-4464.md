### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->headScript()->prependFile('filename1');
    $this->headScript()->appendFile('filename2');
    $this->headScript()->appendFile('filename3');
    echo $this->headScript()->setIndent("!TEST!    ")


Produces the following output:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    !TEST!    !TEST!    
    !TEST!    !TEST!    !TEST!    
    !TEST!    !TEST!    !TEST!

Using your code this is what it outputs for me using the latest svn snapshot:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    !TEST!    
    !TEST!    
    !TEST!

This is the code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    !Test!    
    !Test!    
    !Test!

You are free to re-open this issue, if you can produce a test case for it.
