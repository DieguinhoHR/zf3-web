### Description

Currently, Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_AutoCompleteDojo works with a third party dojo widget instead of the standard dojo.data-backed elements such as ComboBox and FilteringSelect.

dojo.data requires an 'items' object in the response payload in order to parse it, as well as an 'identifier' object indicating which item key indicates the value to be used on submission.

This should also be documented.
