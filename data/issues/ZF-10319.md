### Description

Hi there,

The "Missing To header" exception thrown in line 182 (@version $Id: Sendmail.php 21605 2010-03-22 15:09:03) should never been thrown by method Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail::\_prepareHeaders().

The reasoning for this is:

1. A "To" header is not required by the underlying PHP's mail() function. See: <http://es2.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php>
2. Using BCC headers with the underlying PHP's mail() function via its $additional\_headers optional parameter is perfectly valid.
3. Throwing this exception here avoids the ability to send anonymous emails via PHP's mail() function by only using BCC headers injected through the aforementioned $additional\_headers optional parameter.

So, throwing this exception should be removed from the method. Please consider and correct.

Thanks a lot, Carlos Aguado.
