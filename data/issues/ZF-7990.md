### Description

In Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 there is a small defect. You set endpoint after you do the authentication.

I attached the patch that fixes the problem.

Fatal error: Call to a member function setUsername() on a non-object in /code/ilks/php/src/library/Zend/Http/Client.php on line 545

This is what I get

this is a workaround I have to use for now:

 
        $s3 = new Zend_Service_Amazon_S3($key, $secret);    
        Zend_Service_Amazon_S3::getHttpClient()->setUri('<a rel="nofollow" href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>');
        return $s3;


in this scenario everything works fine

set endpoint before authentication.
