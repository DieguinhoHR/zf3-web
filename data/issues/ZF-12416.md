ZF-12416: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_VideoEntry::getVideoTags() broken

### Description

getVideoTags() always returns a blank array because Zend\_Gdata\_Media\_Extension\_MediaKeywords doesn't have the tag data.

The tags are in Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Category along with the category and other information. The only way to tell tags from category's apart is by using the scheme.

Some who is a bit better with Zend could come up with a more elegant solution but this is the basic code I used to get the tags:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $tags = array();
    foreach ($video->getCategory() as $category) {
        if ($category->getScheme() == '<a href="http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/keywords.cat">http://gdata.youtube.com/schemas/2007/keywords.cat</a>') {
            $tags[] = $category->getTerm();
        }
    }


I am using the latest SVN version 25051 at the time of posting.

This is a intended change to the YouTube API
