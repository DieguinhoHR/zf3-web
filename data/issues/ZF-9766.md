### Description

I would like to attach a translate instance with the log option to Zend\_Validator in order to intercept all untranslated error message, however if I save a Zend\_Translate(\_Adapter) instance for the validators with the code below, the log works for the message foo and bar, but when I call a form with some validators their error messages aren't logged to the file.

Does Zend\_Validate remove in some way the log option from the translate? I read some code, but I don't find anything regarding this.

In my bootstrap I have the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // translator
    $translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext',
                       APPLICATION_PATH . '/var/lang/validate', 'auto',
                       array (
                                       'scan' => Zend_Translate::LOCALE_FILENAME,
                                       'log' => $log, // instance of Zend_Log
                                       'logUntranslated' => true));
    $translate->_('foo');
    Zend_Validate_Abstract::setDefaultTranslator($translate);
    $translate->_('bar');


Now if I call a form with errors, the messages are translated using my translator, but for the messages without translation I don't find any log message (while I still have the foo and the bar lines)

Closing as non-issue.

Zend\_Validate does not return non-translateable strings. All validation messages are ALWAYS translated.

When your attached translation does not provide the related message then Zend\_Validate will use it's own translation without returning an error.

Zend\_Translate's log capability is not involved and can not be used for this case.
