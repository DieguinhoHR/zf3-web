### Description

When defining a many-to-many relationship on the same table, in my case a user having many friends (where a friend is another user), using the mechanics described in the documentation (#10.8.5 on Zend\_Db) results in wrong results, where the resulting rows are equal to the amount of friends the user has, but the results are a copy of the user itself - times three. The situation is as follows.

I have a Table User, defined as follows:

class Application\_Models\_Table\_UserTable extends Zend\_Db\_Table {

 
    protected $_name = 'users';
    protected $_primary = 'user_id';
    protected $_rowClass = 'User';


}

(don't mind the naming btw)

That table has a many-to-many relationship with itself, defined in the following Table (the actual table has two columns, user\_id and friend\_id):

<?php class Application\_Models\_Table\_UserFriends extends Zend\_Db\_Table { protected $\_name = 'users\_friends'; protected $\_primary = array('user\_id', 'friend\_id');

 
    protected $_referenceMap = array(
        'User' => array(
                 'columns' => array('user_id'),
                 'refTableClass' => 'Application_Models_Table_UserTable',
                 'refColumns' => array('user_id') 
                ),
        'Friend' => array(
                    'columns' => array('friend_id'),
                    'refTableClass' => 'Application_Models_Table_UserTable',
                    'refColumns' => array('user_id')
                )
    ); 


}

Next, the call to get the Friends of one users is as follows:

$user = $userTable->find(1); $friends = $user->findManyToManyRowset($user->getTable(), 'Application\_Models\_Table\_UserFriends');

which defaults to the usage of the 'User' rule, if I'm correct. The result however is a Rowset of users where all users are the same user ($user, in this case).

Echo-ing the SQL results in the following query being executed:

SELECT `i`.\*, `m`.\* FROM `users_friends` AS `i` INNER JOIN `users` AS `m` ON `i`.`user_id` = `m`.`user_id` WHERE (`i`.`user_id` = 1)

Manually altering and executing the query to:

SELECT `i`.\*, `m`.\* FROM `users_friends` AS `i` INNER JOIN `users` AS `m` ON `i`.`friend_id` = `m`.`user_id` // i.user\_id changed to i.friend\_id here WHERE (`i`.`user_id` = 1)

results in the right results. I have been unable to change the resulting ON-clause in the query by changing values in the UserFriends $\_referenceMap variable, each change results in errors or wrong results. I'm using version 1.5.2, dunno if this problem is in 1.6.0 or any, but I wasn't able to find it anywhere else in the bugtracker.

I've attempted to follow your description and reproduce, but cannot. If you can provide a simpler and shorter use case, and this is still an issue, please re-open.

Thanks, Ralph
