Have you tested with the branch or just with the release ??? This is part of another issue and has already been fixed in te past with the help of Darby and Sebastian.

It would be interesting if the same problem occurs within trunk or not.

It's current SVN version of release maintenance branch

I tested it using two different Linux machines.

Can you please test with the latest release and give me response ?

Still fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

I attached a debug version for Zend/Locale/Math/PhpMath.php

Please change yours with the debug file and return me the debug output for detail analysis. Thank you

 

 

Posted by Alexander Veremyev (alexander) on 2008-02-18T18:28:00.000+0000

Here is an output of the test code you provided (see the attachment).

Output is generated by passing Zend\_Locale tests set (tests/Zend/Locale/AllTests.php).

Unsure if it will make until 1.0.4... therefor downgrading to critical

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-19T15:31:19.000+0000

I attached a reworked PhpMath file. The problem is related to a autoconversion which is done even after casting to a specific type.

Please test the new version and give me feedback if it now works or if I have to find another way.

 

 

Posted by Alexander Veremyev (alexander) on 2008-02-19T16:57:09.000+0000

Aha. OK!

Here is next output (out1.txt)

Changeset [8266](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=8266) is related to this issue (wrong issue number in the comment)

 

 

Posted by Alexander Veremyev (alexander) on 2008-02-21T19:25:55.000+0000

Fixed for trunk and release maintenance branch.

Thomas, please review the changes

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-02-22T02:26:13.000+0000

I reviewed them and found other problems related to this. I rewrote the class, now it should work in all different environments.

I have no problems in my 3 environments... can you verify that for your's ?

PS: I made the changes only to trunk ! If it works for you you can make the change also to branch (ask darby related to release date)

 

 

Posted by Alexander Veremyev (alexander) on 2008-02-22T10:21:12.000+0000

I've tested it and got a set of errors (see the attached file). I have fix for them and I'm going to commit it. Please review update.

PS Could you mention JIRA issue number within commit comments (like [ZF-xxxx])? JIRA automatically lists such commits within 'FishEye' tab for the specified issue and it's very helpful for linking changesets with issues and merging changes to branches.

Some problems still exist. Needs more complex solution.

Test is marked as skipped.

 

 

Posted by Alexander Veremyev (alexander) on 2008-02-22T11:47:56.000+0000

Priority is downgraded to postpone issue.

Should be fixed with SVN-8532... please verify this and give me feedback... Thank you

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-03-05T10:51:52.000+0000

Fixed
