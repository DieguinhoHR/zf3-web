### Description

Throws exception when trying to setHost() on Zend\\Uri\\Uri

setHost() doesn't allow "localhost:8080" as a valid host.

I'm assuming this should be split out into host:port somewhere much earlier in the process.

Issue was introduced in [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/5ebe4020e64cd01df69def7db6f09dd1d556b8cb) that code has since been moved into Zend/Http/PhpEnvironment/Request.php

This is not a bug in Zend\\Uri, but in the calling code, which should split host and port, then calling setHost() and setPort().

I can't reproduce this. Can you give a example code?

Looks like this was fixed a while ago.

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/5c6489b2f5522991ae342014ea4bb290dfb62fd0)

Thanks for looking at this though.
