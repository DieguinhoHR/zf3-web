ZF-11329: Zend\_Config\_Yaml should ignore comments
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-04-27T19:12:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-19T14:21:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.11.6 (05/May/11)

### Description

It seems the only comments getting properly ignored are those that begin a line. Comments after a value incorrectly remain as part of the value

Example:

Good -

resources: frontController: controllerDirectory: APPLICATION\_PATH/controllers

Bad - resources: frontController: controllerDirectory: APPLICATION\_PATH/controllers #heynow!
