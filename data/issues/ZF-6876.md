----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When i use the Zend\_Config with string that contains quotes, it returns a wrong value with the escape chars. Ex: some.ini

[production] text = "**SOMETHING**"

Using Zend\_Config: $config = new Zend\_Config\_Ini('/path/to/ini/some.ini', 'production'); echo $config->text;

Expected: **SOMETHING**

Returned: **SOMETHING**

Zend\_Config\_Ini uses parse\_ini\_file to read the ini file from disk. This function doesn't support escaping double quotes.
