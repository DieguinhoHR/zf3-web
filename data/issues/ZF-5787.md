ZF-5787: Add URL detection to Zend\_Uri and/or Zend\_Uri\_Http
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Uri already provides the ability to parse a given URI into its components as well as check a given string alleged to contain only a URI in order to confirm that it's valid. [This blog post](http://stephenminded.com/posts/validating-urls-with-zend-framework) is a good example of where the latter capability is used.

Now see [this blog post](http://blog.amnuts.com/2009/02/15/shorten-urls-automatically-with-a-zend-framework-filter/). This illustrates a related feature that is currently lacking, which is the ability to detect one or more valid URIs within a given string and return a list of them.

As an example, the expression to discern a valid URI is already present for Zend\_Uri\_Http; the function called just needs to be changed to find all matches within a given string and then return them as an array of Zend\_Uri objects of the appropriate class. Potential applications for such a feature include spam analysis on blog post comments, automatically converting URLs to HTML links for display, and checking content for broken (404) links.
