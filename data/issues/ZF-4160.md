Zend\_View\_Helper\_PaginationControl passes the partial path directly to $this->view->partial() unmodified.

partial() does not support absolute paths. All paths are relavtive to the view objects scriptPath order.

I think that if you want to call a partial that is global, the best thing to do is perhaps register that global view script path with the view object in your bootstrap. Then you will be able to call paginator.phtml since it will be found in the last script path lookup.

Also, partials being able to accept an absolute path would represent a BC break.

If you still think this is an issue, please reopen, but I think the above mentioned solution should work.
