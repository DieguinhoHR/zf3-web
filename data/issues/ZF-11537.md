### Description

Environment: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql connecting to Microsoft SQL Server 2008

To reproduce:

Create a table in a schema other than dbo, e.g. a schema called "audit", table called e.g. "EventHistory". Invoke Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql::describeTable('EventHistory', null);

Look at the PRIMARY field of the primary key column, which will be false. This is because sp\_pkeys with a null argument for @table\_owner (schema name) works for tables in the 'dbo' schema, but returns 0 primary keys for tables in non-dbo schemas.

Use case:

My application uses $db->listTables() to get a list of all tables, then uses Zend\_Db\_Table instances created from this list to operate on each table. A few tables in my database are in schemas other than 'dbo', e.g. schemas 'audit' and 'cache'.

listTables() lists these tables, but as it doesn't include the schema name I cannot pass this to the Zend\_Db\_Table constructor. (Schema name is marked optional everywhere including on describeTable() so there should be no problem - unless the same table name appears twice.)

Functions acting on tables not in the dbo schema that rely on the primary key, will fail with the message "A table must have a primary key, but none was found."

As a workaround I am extending listTables() to qualify tables in non-dbo schemas with the schema name as follows:

 
    /**
     * Returns a list of the tables in the database.
     * Overrides the Zend implementation to add schema prefix for tables not in the dbo schema.
     * @return array
     */
    public function listTables()
    {
        // Shipped impl: $sql = "SELECT name FROM sysobjects WHERE type = 'U' ORDER BY name";
        // New impl:
        $sql = "SELECT case when s.name is null or s.name = 'dbo' then o.name else s.name+'.'+o.name end as name"
        ." from sysobjects o left join sys.schemas s on o.[uid] = s.[schema_id]"
        ." where o.type = 'U' order by name";
        return $this->fetchCol($sql);
    }


I can then pass the schema name if present on to Zend\_Db\_Table, avoiding this issue.

I could also hack Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql to query for the schema name if schema name is null before calling sp\_pkeys so that the sp\_pkeys call returns correct results. That is probably a better solution (one that doesn't change the contract of listTables()). I don't want to change Zend classes so I am reporting this bug and using the former workaround for now.

I would recommend using the sqlsrv adapter instead of pdo\_mssql; the latter is very much out-dated at this time.

sqlsrv doesn't support connecting to SQL Server from Linux, it is only an option for those running PHP on Windows.

My ZF-based software system runs on Linux and it connects to heterogenous databases within the organisation (PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL and Sybase).

If I provide a patch or snippet will that help?
