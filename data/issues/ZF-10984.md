### Description

Tests have critical errors. In most tests cases used initialization of old Autoloader.

 
        // Store original autoloaders
        $this->loaders = spl_autoload_functions();
        if (!is_array($this->loaders)) {
            // spl_autoload_functions does not return empty array when no
            // autoloaders registered...
            $this->loaders = array();
        }
    
        Autoloader::resetInstance();
        $this->autoloader = Autoloader::getInstance();

Specifies that you speak of Zend\\Application (ZF2) and not Zend\_Application

A lot of the tests are broken in ZF2 at the moment due to the migration to namespaces. Marking this as not an issue.

@Benoit Durand: the component names stay the same, if nothing else for documentation purposes.

@Guy Halfort-Thompson: the issue is raised against "Next Major Release". While we know a number of tests are broken, it's also useful to be able to track which components folks are trying to use and/or test. Filing reports in these situations is fine.

I've re-opened the issue; Andrey has emailed me separately indicating he's interested in doing the work on them.

Ah, apologies, thanks for putting it right. G

Zend\_Application has been removed from ZF2, so this issue is no longer relevant.
