### Description

<http://www.dk-hostmaster.dk/index.php?id=151> says: "You can use all Danish letters as well as ö, ä, ü and é as well as the numbers 0 through 9 and '-'."

The current implementation is: '/^[\\x{002d}0-9a-zäéöü]{1,63}$/iu'

The "Danish letters" mentioned is 'æøå' which lacks from the above regex.
