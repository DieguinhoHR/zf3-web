ZF-3506: Passing array paramters to rewrite router

### Description

Current implementation of the rewrite router does not allow passing array parameters in the /{key}/{value} structure. This prevents creating nicely structured URL's from dynamic data.

Passing arrays can be easily implemented by changing line 174 in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module, from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params[$key] = $val;


To:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params[$key] = (isset($params[$key]) ? (array_merge((array) $params[$key],array($val))): $val);


Which would create an array when the same parameter key is declared multiple times. I wrote a short article about this issue and explained in greater detail on: [[http://techfounder.net/2008/06/â€¦](http://www.techfounder.net/2008/06/23/passing-arrays-to-zend_controller_router/)]
