### Description

The Zend\_Db test suite does not run incubator-specific test components when run from within the incubator/tests directory. A number of E\_NOTICE lines are output suggesting that the trunk version of the test configuration file is being loaded before the incubator version and even stub files creating within the incubator are not being called.

There were no current DB tests in the incubator, so I committed revisions [6819](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6819) and [6820](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6820). The TestHelper.php script in the incubator tests directory makes an include\_path of:

- Incubator library,
- Incubator tests,
- Trunk library,
- Trunk tests, and
- whatever the pre-configured include\_path had been prior to running TestHelper.php.

It should be feasible now to add to the incubator whatever tests are needed.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.
