ZF-12082: Zend\_Feed\_Rss::description() sometimes returns an array and not text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-03-02T11:27:15.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-04-19T11:10:12.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Now then, on a feed which the W3C validator tells me is a valid feed and which upon visual inspection has no quirks (for example [http://dailymail.co.uk/home/search.rss/…](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.rss?searchPhrase=syria) ) I am getting unexpected results from Zend\_Feed\_Rss::description().

Yes, I am using brackets [->description() and not ->description] so I would expect to get the text of the returned, BUT what I actually get for this particular feed is this:

array ( 0 => DOMElement::\_\_set\_state(array( )), 1 => DOMElement::\_\_set\_state(array( )), )

And I wondered if I'm doing something wrong or if the feed is dodgy or if it is something in the framework? Low priority but any advice appreciated. Thank you dudes.

I've just realised that the given feed will be in a constant state of flux, so here I include a snapshot of it where - for me - the mentioned bug is happening:
