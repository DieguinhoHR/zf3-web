### Description

Right now the Amazon S3 component is not able to work on filenames/objectnames containing chars unsuitable for URL. A small test case:

include "Zend/Service/Amazon/S3.php"; $zend = new Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3(key1,key2); $zend->putObject( "giallutest/this is a test", "HELLO WORLD!" );

fails with: PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Uri\_Exception' with message 'Invalid URI supplied' in /home/giallu/Desktop/zend/ZendFramework-1.8.0-minimal/library/Zend/Uri/Http.php:156

The solution to this problem, as noted in: [http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/â€¦](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=15787&tstart=45) is to always urlencode() the object name.

Please also note the Zend\_Serivce\_Amazon\_S3 component is missing from this tracker...
