### Description

The "extends=" line must be first in a section otherwise the other elements in the section will not override the inherited section.

Consider:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [all]
    hostname = all
    name = thisname
    db.host = 127.0.0.1
    db.user = username
    db.pass = password
    db.name = live
    one.two.three = multi
    
    [staging]
    hostname = staging
    db.name = dbstaging
    debug = false
    extends = all


Calling:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini('config.ini', 'staging');


results in hostname = all, rather than hostname = staging.

Of course, this will become moot once ZF-352 is implemented...

Fixed implicitly by ZF-352
