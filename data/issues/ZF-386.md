### Description

As I checked out the repository using svn export <http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk> I noticed that many files have set the executable permission, i.e. trunk/LICENSE.txt svn proplist [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/LICENSE.txt)

You can correct this by using svn propdel -R svn:executable /path/to/trunk but I don't have a clue how to avoid for the future that someone sets this permission for non executable files. It seems that some windows svn clients set this permission ...
