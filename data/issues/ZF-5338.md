ZF-5338: Example of Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer in MVC application
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There is currently a short paragraph explaining how to use Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer in an MVC application, but a short code listing showing how to pass the response object to the login() or check() method (Does it have to be sent to both? Just one? Does it matter which one?) would be helpful.
