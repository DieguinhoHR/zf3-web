### Description

For a confirmation step, forms aren't usually redrawn, but the values displayed in a normal webpage fashion with just a "Confirm" button being the only input. If a form validates it would be nice to call a function like setHidden() to set all inputs to a hidden type with the current value in "value".

I'd argue that you should not allow re-submitting already validated data; it adds extra overhead, as well as the potential for a user to change their submission. Store the submitted data in the session, and have a simple confirmation form that asks them to verify the details; if they want to edit the data, they can then get a form that populates it from the stored data in the session.

Additionally, you can accomplish what you suggest easily already:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <? foreach ($this->form->getElements() as $element): ?>
    <?= $this->formHidden($element->getName(), $element->getValue()) ?>
    <? endforeach ?>


You could easily create a helper to accomplish this if you find its a common enough occurrence in your forms.
