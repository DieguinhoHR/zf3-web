It works for me.

Are you sure you told Zend\_View to use XHTML in your Bootstrap, or somewhere else prior to the form rendering?

Try something like this in your Bootstrap:

$view = new Zend\_View; $view->doctype('XHTML1\_STRICT');

If you don't tell the view to use XHTML tags it defaults to HTML.

As noted in another comment, ZF defaults to HTML4 compliance, not XHTML1. You must call $view->doctype('XHTML1\_STRICT') (or one of the other XHTML constant strings) _prior_ to rendering the form for XHTML compliance to be enabled.
