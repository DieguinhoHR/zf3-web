ZF-6116: Required fields don't throw exception in parse if no params are passed to script
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-24T04:57:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:04.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The parse function just while loops through the argv. If there are no arguments then the parse never fails. If you have required fields I would imagine that an exception should be thrown if you don't pass any of them. Below is a working fix for it, but probably the check belongs in it's own function and maybe there are helpers for this already that I've missed.
