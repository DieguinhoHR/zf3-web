### Description

Hi gentle support, this report of an issue that i tryed for 2 days to resolve, but i really can't to figure out a solution.

The problem is that i configure locale by my application.ini file but i don't have the right translation loaded.

To reproduce the problem:

FILE: application.ini ; Locale resources.locale.default = "en" resources.locale.force = 1

; Translate resources.translate.adapter = csv resources.translate.data = APPLICATION\_CONFIGS "/locale/" resources.translate.scan = Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_FILENAME resources.translate.disableNotices = 1

FILE: Bootstrap.php protected function \_initLocale() { $resource = $this->getPluginResource('locale'); if($resource == NULL) return;

 
        $options  = $resource->getOptions();
        $locale = $resource->init();
    }
    
    protected function _initTranslate()
    {
        $resource = $this->getPluginResource('translate');
        if($resource == NULL)
            return;
    
        $translate = $resource->init();
        Zend_Debug::dump($translate->getOptions(), "Options are:");
        Zend_Debug::dump($translate->getAdapter()->getMessages(), "Translated messages are:");
        Zend_Debug::dump($translate->getAdapter()->getList(), "List of locale is:");
    }


FILE: IndexController.php public function indexAction() { // locale is ok! echo sprintf("Locale is **%s**", Zend\_Registry::get('Zend\_Translate')->getAdapter()->getLocale()); echo "  
"; // but after traslating, the result is wrong echo sprintf("String translated is **%s**", $this->view->translate('this is a test')); }

FILE: en.csv this is a test;this is a test

FILE: it.csv this is a test;questo Ã¨ un test

File: fr.csv this is a test;ceci est un test

Thanks in advance, i really hope that was not caused by my maybe wrong configurations.

Best Regards

Zend\_Translate is said to use the browsers locale. I see no failure. Only the problem that your configuration depends on the settings of the accessing user.

It would be better to see \* what your results are \* what you expect \* which locale you are using \* your browsers locale settings

Closing as non-reproduceable as there is no response from the reporter
