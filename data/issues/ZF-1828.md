### Description

I'm geting this error when using FlashMessenger Helper :

Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property Zend\_Session\_Namespace::$default has no effect in /www/2mx.int/library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/FlashMessenger.php on line 133

I'm using php 5.2.0, with the latest svn export.

It's seems relatated to overloading array ? [http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/â€¦](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/131-Overloading-arrays-in-PHP-5.2.0.html)

Issue with Zend\_Session and php 5.2.0 specific to the \_\_get() return type.

This is due to BC breaks introduced in PHP 5.2.0 that were corrected in 5.2.1. Will not fix; please try and upgrade your installation to a later version of the 5.2.x series.
