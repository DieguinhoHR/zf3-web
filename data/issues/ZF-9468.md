### Description

Problem: When pointing in config application.ini to load some plugins, such as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.frontController.plugins = Some_Plugin
    resources.frontController.plugins = Another_Plugin


then Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller trying to create them, but not to load. So, in projects, where autoloading is off, there isn't other way than directly include all plugin files in index.php

i think, it's bad practice. Especially, when i'm using different sets of plugins in different environments.

this is a very simple issue and only 3 lines of code fixes them. attaching them as a patch (to version 1.10.2)

Honestly, we have to assume the plugins are autoloadable for this to work -- and since Zend\_Application both assumes and instantiates the autoloader, this is a valid requirement.

Resolving as wont-fix for the reasons outlined by Matthew.
