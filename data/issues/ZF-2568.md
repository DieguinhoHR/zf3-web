### Description

If a translator is used, Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Errors passes %value% (and additional message variables) subtitution in validation messages.

I encountered the same problem trying to translate errors messages. I found that the translation were done in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Errors, after that each error message were processed by the function Zend\_Validate\_Abstract::\_createMessage

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Form_Decorator_Errors::render () {
    
        // ...
    
            $errors = $element->getMessages();
            if (empty($errors)) {
                return $content;
            }
    
            if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
                foreach ($errors as $code => $message) {
                    $errors[$code] = $translator->translate($code); // pre-processed messages are deleted here
                }
            }


Maybe that the translator should be passed to each validator to create localized validators

Available as of r7854 (make sure you update both incubator and core). Translations are now possible globally for all validators extending Zend\_Validate\_Abstract, which affects Zend\_Validate, Zend\_Form, and Zend\_Filter\_Input. This change also allows for variable substitution in messages.
