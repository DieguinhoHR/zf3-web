ZF-4635: Allow Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit to support more types in \_prepareDijit()

### Description

Currently Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit::\_prepareDijit() has limited support for dijit types as specified by its $type parameter. If an un accounted for $type is specified the method will break as $stripParams is not set to an array.

This improvement provides a simple fix so that the method will continue to work for unknown types and will be required when adding new dijit view helpers in future releases.
