ZF-10148: Zend\_Config\_Ini does not properly nest array properties
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Config\_Ini does not properly nest when array properties are present. When given a config file like this:

property.one.value = foo property.two.value = bar property.array.value[] = foo property.array.value[] = bar

I can do this:

echo $cfg->property->one->value; // prints foo

I would expect to be able to do the following:

$array = $cfg->property->array->value->toArray(); // returns a 2-element array with "foo" and "bar"

but that fails. Inspecting the data of the Zend\_Config\_Ini object, the key for the array entries is "property.array.value", not "property" with subkey "array" and sub-subkey "value".

For an ini file like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    property.one.value = foo
    property.two.value = bar
    property.array.value[] = foo
    property.array.value[] = bar


Loaded like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini($filename, 'production');
    Zend_Debug::dump($config->property->array->value->toArray());


I get this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(2) {
      [0] => string(3) "foo"
      [1] => string(3) "bar"
    }


However, something goes wrong if you don't have a section defined.

I don't think this is fixable.

For an ini file of"

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    property.one.value = foo
    property.two.value = bar
    property.array.value[] = foo
    property.array.value[] = bar
    
    [test.value]
    a = b
    c = d


parse\_ini\_file() will give this array:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(4) {
      ["property.one.value"] => string(3) "foo"
      ["property.two.value"] => string(3) "bar"
      ["property.array.value"] => array(2) {
        [0] => string(3) "foo"
        [1] => string(3) "bar"
      }
      ["test.value"] => array(2) {
        ["a"] => string(1) "b"
        ["c"] => string(1) "d"
      }
    }


There's no way to determine the difference between "property.array.value" which is a key and "test.value" which is a section heading. Therefore we assume that they are both section headings which is why you get the behaviour you do.

Another way to do this is for your ini file to look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    property.one.value = foo
    property.two.value = bar
    property.array.value.0 = foo
    property.array.value.1 = bar

Resolved as "Won't Fix" as it is not possible to fix it whilst we depend on parse\_ini\_file()

Let me note once more that for ZF2 we should evaluate if we still want to be dependent on parse\_ini\_file() since we've run across quite a lot of limitations in this seemingly simple function.
