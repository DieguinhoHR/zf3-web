ZF-5167: Warnings generated if Zip extention is not installed
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-12-05T11:31:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-21T05:03:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.2 (23/Dec/08)

### Description

Zend/Search/Lucene/Documents/Docx.php, OpenXml.php, Pptx.php and Xlsx.php all have a line like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if (class_exists ( 'ZipArchive' )) {


On systems where the Zip extension is not loaded, this generates the warning:

Warning: Zend\_Loader::include\_once(ZipArchive.php) [zend-loader.include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Users/rob/ZFiA/code/lib/Zend/Loader.php on line 89

Fix is to change the class\_exists() call to:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if (class_exists ( 'ZipArchive' , false)) {
