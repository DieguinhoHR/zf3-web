### Description

Hi,

It's probably just a typo, in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit, method _Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dijit:\_createFormElement()_ is declared public when its name suggests it's protected/private.

Regards, Remy

This is because it's meant to be public, but not intended for general consumption; it is used by a number of the various dijit helpers in order to create the markup, but in most cases only used internally.
