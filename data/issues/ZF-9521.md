### Description

It would be much more convenient if the Zend\_Json could properly encode array of objects having toJson() method. I wrote just a few additional lines to have this working locally. It's just all about DRY.

I've reviewed the patch and confirm it operates as intended. Recommend committing to trunk (need to check with Matthew on adding to release branch as it adds to the API). Please ensure a ZF2 git pull request including matching changes is issued for ZF2 before resolving.
