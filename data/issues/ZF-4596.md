### Description

'onChange'=> "stateStore2 = new dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore({url: '/studiegids/overzichtschool/studierichting/onderwijsvormid/'+ dijit.byId('onderwijsvorm\_id').getValue() }); dijit.byId('studierichting\_id').store = stateStore2; dijit.byId('studierichting\_id').setDisplayedValue('');", b adding this will requery statestore2. Because it passes an id, the query will give other results. Because of this the dojo datastore gets other values.

Matthew, I can't make heads or tails of this. Can you figure out if it is our code to document and take appropriate action?

I cannot find any reference to any of this text in our documentation. Looking at the example, it's entirely unclear whether it has any relation to ZF at all.

Marking as "Incomplete" Feel free to reopen, but please give full details when you do -- where the code comes from, and a clear explanation of what is wrong or needs to be improved.
