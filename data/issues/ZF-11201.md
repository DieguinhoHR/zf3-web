### Description

It would be great if the public function authenticate respectively the function \_authenticateCreateSelect could get a parameter which allows to compare the entered strings also in [BINARY mode](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/charset-binary-op.html) to check if the compared string are really binary the same (e.g. in PHP it would be the === comparison instead of ==).
