### Description

(copied from TRAC #9 - reported by gwaihir gw h r.n t)

For you guys to ponder: the Zend framework doesn't currently quote the column names in its (My)SQL queries. This gives issues when using "special" characters in those names and thus I found myself haphazardly adding them: From: Zend/Db/Select.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __toString()
        {
            //unchanged parts
     
            // add columns
            /** WH: Updated to quote column names in back-ticks (`). Needed for '-' in a column name.
             * Note that I am not sure how databases other than MySQL respond to those back-ticks.
             * Note also how - probably inefficiently - the select is for all columns by name, rather than *.
             * @todo: find a way to do this without altering the library code.
             */
            if ($this->_parts['cols']) {
                $sql .= '`'. implode("`,\n\t`", $this->_parts['cols']) . "`\n";
            }
     
            //more unchanged parts
        }


If this affects other database systems differently than MySQL, then I dunno how / where this had best be done. If it doesn't hurt any of them, then please implement right away. :D I'm very exited about this development. PHP really lacks a "master" framework (like Ruby's Rails or some of Java's frameworks). I think the future success of the language rides on it (now that PHP5 already covers most other wishes). With kind regards, Wim Heemskerk

Also, the same problem arises in MySQL when column names use reserved words (e.g. timestamp).

Right or wrong, phpMyAdmin permits this, and some people do this.

See also #92, issue is not limited to MySQL.

The same issue also applies to using reserved words (e.g. 'group') as table names in MySQL. Line 80 of Db/Adaptor/Pdo/Mysql.php should be changed from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sql = "DESCRIBE $table";


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sql = "DESCRIBE `$table`";

A more portable solution would be to use the adapter's quoteIdentifier method to quote column and table names:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    public function __toString()
    
    ...
    
    $cols = $this->_parts['cols'];
    foreach($cols as $col_key => $col_val) {
        $cols[$col_key] = $this->_adapter->quoteIdentifier($col_val);
    }
    
    ...

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

As of revision 3897, all SQL generated by Zend\_Db classes should quote identifiers.

You can use a Zend\_Db\_Expr to override an identifier if you don't want it quoted.
