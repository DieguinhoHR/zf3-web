### Description

Hi there, With html5 we need now to generate input forms with new types: (email,url,number,range Date pickers (date, month, week, time, datetime, datetime-local). For example jquery tools (and most of new javascript validator plugins) uses validators based upon these types: [http://jquerytools.org/documentation/validator/…](http://jquerytools.org/documentation/validator/index.html)

Will zf2 implement these types ?

See [http://enrise.com/2010/12/…](http://www.enrise.com/2010/12/html5-zend-framework-form-elements/)

Best regards

David
