### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli returns a string, which is really strange behaviour, and should be an integer imho.

The code is now:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function lastInsertId($tableName = null, $primaryKey = null)
        {
            $mysqli = $this->_connection;
            return (string) $mysqli->insert_id;
        }

And should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function lastInsertId($tableName = null, $primaryKey = null)
        {
            $mysqli = $this->_connection;
            return (int) $mysqli->insert_id;
        }

the last inserted ID could be a varchar.

I just tested it. $mysqli->insert\_id only seems to return numeric values. If the primary key/row is a varchar field, it simply returns (string)"0".

Actually, you're making an invalid assumption here: that only autoincremented IDs are ever used with tables. In reality, the primary key can be any unique field; it's not uncommon to use hashes, email addresses, or usernames as the primary key. In such a case, casting lastInsertId() to an integer will return an invalid value. Casting to a string at worst returns a string representation of an integer -- the value, in PHP, remains the same.
