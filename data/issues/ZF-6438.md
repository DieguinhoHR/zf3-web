### Description

The 'percent' value in the JSON data returned by the notify function of Zend\_ProgressBar\_Adapter\_JsPull and Zend\_ProgressBar\_Adapter\_JsPull use the localized decimal point for representing float.

In french , the decimal point is a comma, and comma is the separator of JSON properties, so it leads to a Javascript error.

PHP never outputs a number in another format, except when you set a locale-value for numbers within PHP. Please provide a reproduce case for this.

 <? setlocale(LC\_NUMERIC,"fr\_FR.utf8"); echo 1.23; // print : 1,23 ?> Now the question is should the user unset the locale when using JsPull or should JsPull transforms any localised format into the specific format used for JSON strings...

For exacly those reasons you should not use setlocale() (also, because it is not thread-safe). Use Zend\_Locale\_Format to format numbers and other things.
