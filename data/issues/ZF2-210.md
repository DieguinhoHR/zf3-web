ZF2-210: Cannot profile a database query
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-03-09T21:14:43.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:25.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

In ZF1 you could profile a database query, but there currently in ZF2 there is no equivalent to $dbAdapter->getProfiler()->setEnabled(true);

This prevents you from examining the last query executed (which in turn prevents Zend\\Authentication\\DbTableTest::testAdapterCanUseModifiedDbSelectObject() from running) and it will also prevent database query timing using Firebug
