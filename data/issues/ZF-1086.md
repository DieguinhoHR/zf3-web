### Description

Hi, I have an improvement to ask :

While using Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower::filter() as well as Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim::filter() as well as any filter function that expects an only string to be passed as param; you should cast the param to String inside the function itself :

StringToLower.php before :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Filter_StringToLower implements Zend_Filter_Interface
    {
         public function filter($value)
        {
            return strtolower($value);
        }
    }


StringToLower.php after (asked) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Filter_StringToLower implements Zend_Filter_Interface
    {
         public function filter($value)
        {
            return strtolower( (string)$value);
        }
    }


That is, think about that use case :

GET /mypage.php?my\_message='Hi' HTTP 1.1 (...)

 
    <pre class="highlight">Zend_Filter_StringToLower::filter($_GET['my_message']);
    // will output 'hi' ; all right.


Now consider this use : GET /mypage.php?my\_message[]='Hi' HTTP 1.1 (...)

 
    <pre class="highlight">Zend_Filter_StringToLower::filter($_GET['my_message']);
    // will generate a Notice : Array to string conversion in my\file\dot\php on line my_line.


Note that my\_message is passed as an array this time, anyone can modify the type of params in the URL for a GET request, thus generating in that case a Notice : Array to string conversion in my\\file\\dot\\php on line my\_line.

Some of you would say that it's the programmer's job to cast the GET variable manually before passing it to the filter, by I personally think that the filter function should do it by itself, as it expects a string in all cases, and nothing else...
