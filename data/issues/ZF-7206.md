Closing as duplicate. If you feel the issue still hasn't been resolved for you (are you using 1.8.4?) please reopen the duplicated issue.

I use SVN URL: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend)

where static and final in Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Method is still ignored.
