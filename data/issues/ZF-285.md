### Description

The PDO object allows you to pass "driver\_options" in its constructor. These include options like PDO::ATTR\_EMULATE\_PREPARES (See <http://netevil.org/node.php?nid=795>), which is currently required for some operations with the PDO mysql driver. Obviously there are other options which may be useful as well.

It is possible set these options with code such as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('pdo_mysql', array(
        'dbname' => 'dbname',
        'username' => 'username',
        'password' => 'password'
    ));
    
    $db->quote(''); // Dummy thing to force a connection.
    $db->getConnection()->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, true);


But this involves forcing a connection which defeats the object behind delaying the creation of a connection.

It would be preferable to be able to do the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('pdo_mysql', array(
        'dbname' => 'dbname',
        'username' => 'username',
        'password' => 'password',
        'driver_options' => array(
            PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES => true
        )
    ));


and the driver options would be passed into PDO::\_\_construct(). (See [http://uk.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.pdo-construct.php))

This relates to ZF-147

This is also needed for setting the PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_MAX\_BUFFER\_SIZE attribute, which cannot be set using PDO::setAttribute(). See PHP bug 38015 (<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38015>). Although it is possible to sub-class the adapter to pass additional parameters, this is really hacky. Unfortunately, until this issue is corrected, that will be the only solution for MySQL users to use queries larger than 1048576 bytes.

Martin,

As far as I know, there is currently no other way than to extend Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql.

My solution looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Fx_Db_Adapter_PdoMysql extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql {
      protected function _connect() {
        if ($this->_connection)
          return;
            
        parent::_connect();
            
        // please do not touch names if I don't tell you to do so
        $this->_connection->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_CASE, PDO::CASE_NATURAL);
            
        $this->query('SET NAMES utf8');
      }
    }


Next issue: If you don't want to name your class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_... or Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_..., because it's not a class provided by Zend, you can't use Zend\_Db::factory(). Instead you have to instantiate your adapter, i.e.: $db = new Fx\_Db\_Adapter\_PdoMysql($config);

This is a fix for this issue. At least for the Pdo\_Abstract. I'm not sure if I have to sign the legendary contribution-agreement for such a simple patch, but if it is needed I'm willing to do. Also I'm not sure if it is needed to test first with array\_key\_exists() if the property is given?

Hi Lars, yes a CLA would be most welcome, as would be additional help bug fixing the Db classes. Whatever fix we apply, it should avoid causing "Notice: Undefined index: driver\_options", whenever the developer does not provide that array of driver options to the factory method.

So now we need to test if a null value for this parameter or an empty array can be used, if the developer does not include "driver\_options". For example,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_connection = new PDO(
         $this->_dsn(),
         $this->_config['username'],
         $this->_config['password'],
         (isset($this->_config['driver_options']) ? $this->_config['driver_options'] : array())
    );

This problem surfaces a more serious flaw in the design of the Zend\_Db::factory() method.

The entire process of configuring an adapter should not be compressed into an artificial PHP array, $options, passed to the factory constructor. Instead, a normal, object-oriented factory with real methods should provide the necessary mechanisms to configure and initialize an adapter instance.

OK, signed the CLA. Are there any plans to commit the patch (please use the version of Gavin Vess)?

 

 

Posted by Bill Karwin (bkarwin) on 2006-11-13T15:22:37.000+0000

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

What's the status of this issue? I have signed the CLA and am willing to contribute a patch.

It looks like Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract::\_connect() needs modified to look in $\_config for an array of parameters. To me, it makes little sense for derived classes to be forced to override \_connect(). PDO::\_\_construct() takes 4 parameters. ZF only supports 3. It doesn't make sense for ZF, or any framework, to limit the options the end-user has.

Hi Gregory, yes this issue is on the schedule for implementation in Zend Framework 0.9. We ran out of time to implement it in ZF 0.8. Keep in mind that implementation includes writing unit tests and documentation, so it's not as simple as just adding a line of code.

Resolved with [SVN r4808](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=4808).
