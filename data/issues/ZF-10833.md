### Description

My application has windows-1251 encoding. $view->setEncoding('WINDOWS-1251'); and all files in this encoding.

When I'm trying to add SubmitButton to dojo form with some cyrillic label like this:

 
        $subForm1->addElement('SubmitButton', 'submit', array(
            'label'    => 'Показать',
        ));


I see button with label 'null' in html result.

Works only code below:

 
        $subForm1->addElement('SubmitButton', 'submit', array(
            'label'    => iconv('WINDOWS-1251','UTF-8','Показать'),
        ));

And there no problems with other elements: $subForm1->addElement( 'ComboBox', 'combobox', array( 'label' => 'Показать', 'value' => 'blue', 'autocomplete' => false, 'multiOptions' => array( 'red' => 'Rouge', 'blue' => 'Показать', 'white' => 'Показать2', 'orange' => 'Orange', 'black' => 'Noir', 'green' => 'Vert', ), ));

i've subbmited a similar bug <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11247>, maybe it is relevant

It is hard to reproduce this error exactly, results are contradictive, personally I work with Netbeans 7 and store everything to UTF-8. After specifiying the encoding for the view the label on the submitButton was displayed correctly. The dropdownlist from the comment failed to display the correct characters. Using iconv to force encode the string to Windows-1251 resulted in wrong characters in all occasions

The problem lies within json\_encode-ing a non-utf8 string. As per the docs, json\_encode supports only utf-8.

I'd close this as a won't fix.

Use utf8 everywhere or use declarative dojo as in that case no json\_encoding happens and everything (should) work.

Agreed with Robert -- use UTF-8 everywhere, or you'll get unpredictability, particularly if you're working with ext/json.
