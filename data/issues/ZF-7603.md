ZF-7603: Syslog writer facility should be long
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-08-15T02:48:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-06-21T06:00:27.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.6 (22/Jun/10)
 
 Reporter:  Péter Nagy (antronin)  Assignee:  Ramon Henrique Ornelas (ramon)  Tags: - Zend\_Log
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-10015](/issues/browse/ZF-10015)
 
 Attachments: - [Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/13150/Zend_Log_Writer_Syslog.patch)
 
### Description

In Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog::_facility is defined as string and it is sent to openlog() this way hence openlog()'s 3rd parameter should be long, choosen from the predefined PHP constans LOG_\*. I would recommend to use the string with constant($this->\_facility) and document that user should specify the constant name to use if required.

So the patch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _initializeSyslog()
        {
            self::$_lastApplication = $this->_application;
            self::$_lastFacility    = $this->_facility;
            openlog($this->_application, LOG_PID, cnstant($this->_facility));
        }

I made a typo in the code above ("cnstant" is "constant"). The last line should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    openlog($this->_application, LOG_PID, constant($this->_facility));

Actually, by default, the $\_facility parameter is defined to the value of the LOG\_USER constant; it's not actually a string, though the docblock reports it as such. You can alter the facility using a setter, but the assumption is that you're passing in one of those constants.

I think one of two things need to happen: \* The $_facility property needs to be marked as an integer \* setFacility() needs to check the value against the known LOG_\* constants.

I'll proceed with those changes.

Unittests missing

Closing again since there's been a separate issue added for the tests (ZF-10015).

Problem [r22450](http://framework.zend.com/code/viewrep/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Log/Writer/Syslog.php?r1=20096&r2=22451) some constants not exists in windows generate notices.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_validFacilities = array(
        LOG_AUTH,
        LOG_AUTHPRIV,
        LOG_CRON,
        LOG_DAEMON,
        LOG_KERN,
        LOG_LOCAL0,
        LOG_LOCAL1,

        LOG_NEWS,
        LOG_SYSLOG,
        LOG_USER,
        LOG_UUCP,
    );


Constants what may not exists depending do system operational: LOG\_AUTHPRIV, LOG\_CRON, LOG\_LOCAL0, LOG\_LOCAL1, LOG\_LOCAL2, LOG\_LOCAL3, LOG\_LOCAL4, LOG\_LOCAL5, LOG\_LOCAL6, LOG\_LOCAL7, LOG\_NEWS, LOG\_SYSLOG, LOG\_UUCP.

Resolved problem notices in patch.

In patch added Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog::\_initializeValidFacilities()

If Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog::\_initializeValidFacilities() called in the Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog::\_\_construct() could cause break BC.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Custom_Writer_System extends Zend_Log_Writer_Syslog
    {
        public function __construct($config)
        {
            // my code
        }
    }

I made one minor change to the patch, and that was to do the detection of the validFacilities array size within the setFacility() method. This reduces the number of function calls necessary for applications where the facility may be changed multiple times.

Patch applied to trunk and 1.10 release branch.
