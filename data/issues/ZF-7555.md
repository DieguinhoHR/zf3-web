Problem doesn't appear if Zend\_Http\_Cookie tests runs separately. So the problem is caused by some other test.

This happens because (surprisingly) phpUnit runs the static dataProvider method before running the actual test method - probably at the beginning of the test case.

The code there tests a cookie which is 15 seconds in the future - if running the tests is very slow, and it takes more than 15 seconds between running the dataProvider function and running the test, the test will fail.

I will increase this to 12 hours in the future instead of 15 seconds - I assume this should be enough.

Fixed in trunk rev. 17555 - still need to merge to release branch
