### Description

In order to use table names other than 'queue' and 'message' in Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db, one must currently extend three classes:

1. Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db\_Message to change the message table name
2. Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db\_Queue to change the queue table name
3. Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db to override \_\_construct or add table setter methods to override the default table usage.

It seems like this is something that should and could be supported easily through an option key or setter method.

Patch with unit test and updated docs attached.

Also attaching instructions on TestConfiguration.php settings and related steps to turn on the the Zend\_Queue\_Db unit tests to make it easier for whoever is testing/applying this patch. Thanks!

As well as the name of the table, we should have an option to the schema too. It will be nice, while working with postgres.

While working with the Db adapter, why not use the Zend\_Db\_Table classes, for message and queue? Doing this, we could intercept the methods used by, like the insert, or the update.Instead of using the database adapter methods for update, select, insert, I purpose to use the Zend\_Db\_Table methods.
