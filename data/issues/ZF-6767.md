### Description

I was experiencing some problems with code for Zend\_Form making duplicated id's for dt and dd into certain situations.

I posted this also in mailinglist, but since i think is rather a bug i will post also on issue tracker.

I am trying to create a form which would have the values something like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    0=>array('name'=>'blabla', 'periods'=>array(0=>array('start'='22.05.2009', 'end'='29.05.2009', 'price'=>'123'), 1=>array('start'='15.07.2009', 'end'='18.06.2009', 'price'=>'234'))
    1=>..................


I am creating for this 2 levels of subforms, which are added this way: first subform is added to main form, second subform is added multiple times to first subform like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            foreach($i=1; $i<=5; $i++){
                $f = new MainForm_Form_SecondSubform();
    //$f->setName( 'sf2'.$i (;
                $this->addSubForm($f, 'sf2'.$i);
            }


I am getting some problems because the rendered form has some duplications on dt and dd id's:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
    


Would be the same for all those 5 subforms....

The labels from dt and so on are having diff id's that's fine:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


But for dt and dd that's not the same thing... They are duplicated...

I am getting same problem again.

Each subform is added like this:

 
        for($i=1; $i<=2; $i++){
            $this->addSubForm(new $subformClass(), $i, 100+$i);
            $this->$i->setLegend('Website '.$i.' Information');
        }


See a raw sample of html output.

There are 2 things you need to do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function render($content)
    {
            //...
            if (null !== $tag) {
                require_once 'Zend/Form/Decorator/HtmlTag.php';
                $decorator = new Zend_Form_Decorator_HtmlTag();
                /* change this
                $decorator->setOptions(array('tag' => $tag,
                                             'id'  => $this->getElement()->getName() . '-label'));
                */
                $decorator->setOptions(array('tag' => $tag,
                                             'id'  => $this->getElement()->getId() . '-label'));
    
                $label = $decorator->render($label);
            }
            //....
     
        }


And

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function loadDefaultDecorators()
        {
            //...
                    /*
                    Remove this
                    ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dd',
                                                    'id'  => $this->getName() . '-element'))
                    */
                    ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dd',
                                                    'id'  => $this->getId() . '-element'))
            //...
        }

Any idea when the changes suggested by Bert Van Hauwaert would be added to trunk ?

Due to this bugs working with multiple levels of subforms seems to be a totally mess...

 

 

Posted by Cristian Bichis (avantis) on 2009-11-13T02:38:19.000+0000

The same problem is at rendering subforms itself,

i got lot of id's as: 1-label 1-element

for dt and dd elements of the subform.

And of course, the same for fieldsets where i have lot of id's like:

fieldset-1, fieldset-2

So basically the way are created the ID's are breaking the XHMTL, and would make working with client side js to become more complicated, because we simply can't trust the id's...

Bert Van Hauwaert, i think the Zend\_Form\_Element fix doesn't work.

This bug is still present as of ZF 1.10.

A subform (52) within a subform (analysts) with a form:

 First name   Last name   Delete?
