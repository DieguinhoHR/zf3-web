ZF-1656: Using specific lifetime record for cache with infinite lifetime
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If i have cache with infinite lifetime, like

$frontendOptions = array( 'lifetime' => null, ... );

$backendOptions = array( ... );

$cache = Zend\_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);

And i want to save the record with specific lifetime:

$cache->save( $data, $id, $tags, 60 );

It couldn't work, because in Backend\\File.php in function save(), is used private function \_expireTime():

 
    private function _expireTime($lifetime) 
    {
        if (is_null($this->_directives['lifetime'])) {
            return 9999999999;
        }
        return time() + $lifetime;
    }


And it always return the maximum lifetime 9999999999 in our example.
