### Description

I have the following file form element on a (mail) form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement('file', 'attachments', array(
        'label'      => 'Attachment(s) (max. 400KB each)',
        'required'   => false,
        'validators' => array(
            array('count', false, array('max' => 3)),
            array('size', false, 400*1024)),
        'maxFileSize' => 400*1024,
        'multiFile' => 3,
        'destination' => WEBSITE_PATH . 'upload',
    ));


On posting I: - populate the form with the post values and some read-only disabled values from the session. - validate the form using $form->isValid($form->getValues()) (passing in $\_POST does not work as that does not contain the disabled values) - call getFileName() on the file form element - call getValue() on the file form element ()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = $this->getElement('attachments');
    $pathNames = $element->getFileName();
    $fileNames = $element->getValue();


This will trigger the validation error as the aray of file names now contains 4 elements: - C:\\Windows\\temp\\php....tmp - C:\\Windows\\temp\\php....tmp - WEBSITE\_PATH\\upload\\fileName1.tmp - WEBSITE\_PATH\\upload\\fileName2.tmp

Workaround: Set the ValueDisabled option to true. However, I think that this just hides the error.

It seems to be Zend\_Form issue for me.

Closing as non-issue.

You call "getValues" and transfer the files with this request. Then you call "getValue" again but only on the file element.

Do you expect to get the files 2 times?

As soon as the file has been transferred there is no file anymore. I was not able to verify your mentioned behaviour and I tried several different variants.

Note: Setting valueDisabled means that non of your 2 requests will return a file. Wether getValues within the form, nor getValue from the element.
