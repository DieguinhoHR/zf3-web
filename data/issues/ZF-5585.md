### Description

Hi all!

This is my first bug-report to ZendFramework project, so first of all, let me thank all ZF-team for developing such a nice free product!

I have recently encountered a following problem with Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini: method write() sometimes could fail with exception Zend\_Config\_Exception('Could not write to file "...), if there are a lot of consecutive config writes within a small period of time (3-5 seconds).

I wrote some code yesterday, that is executed by CRON and can run longer that php timeout allows. To get round that timeout, I've written a code to broke the job into several parts and store the state info into config file with Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini. When I tested the code, sending manual http requests, I noticed that sometimes Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini->write() was throwing an exception Zend\_Config\_Exception('Could not write to file "...). I think, it happens, because file\_put\_contents() function, that is used by Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini->write(), does some output buffering and when it processes a lot of consecutive config writes (from different script runs), there are some collisions with file write access, that leads to file\_put\_contents() failure. When I rewrited the code , that does config file processing, with ordinary fopen-flock(LOCK\_EX)-fwrite-fflush-fclose functions, the problem disappeared.

The bug is hard to reproduce - I tried to reproduce it today to test if file\_put\_contents(,,LOCK\_EX) would solve the problem, but I failed - Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini worked fine. But this could also mean, that filesystem cache (I use Apache2 on WindowsXP) was relatively fresh that time and able to prevent such collisions.

I think, there are at least two possible solutions: 1) rewrite Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini->write() with fopen-flock(LOCK\_EX)-fwrite-fflush-fclose functions. It guaranties that the file will be written correctly, or 2) make an option for Zend\_Config\_Writer\_Ini to pass to file\_put\_contents() function the LOCK\_EX flag. In theory, it should also help in such situations, but I failed to test it.

BTW: the bug could also exists in different Zend\_Config\_Writer\_\* classes, that uses file\_put\_contents().

The second solution sounds good, I will implement that soon.

Fixed with r13708 and merged into 1.7 release branch with r13709.
