### Description

Fatal error "Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar' not found in /usr/share/php/Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Base64.php on line 37" is thrown when trying to include/work with/'class\_exists-ing' class Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar or some class which is derived from it.

This error seems not to be rare - try to google it: [http://google.com/search/â€¦](http://www.google.com/search?q=Fatal+error:+Class+'Zend_XmlRpc_Value_Scalar'+not+found)

I suppose, that it is caused because of 'circular dependencies'.  
 File Zend/XmlRpc/Value/String.php requires Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Scalar.php; Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Scalar.php requires Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php; and Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php requires Zend/XmlRpc/Value/String.php. In the Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php is the Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Base64.php as the first included file, which depends on Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Scalar class, and that is probably why in fatal error description is said: "... not found in /usr/share/php/Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Base64.php on line 37"

When this chain is broken (for example by commenting out all includes in Zend/XmlRpc/Value.php), it works. Moreover, because of autoloading feature is enabled, all classes are also available, so all seems to work correct.

Here is sample PHP test code, which demonstrates this issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    <?php
    
      // -- set include_path:
            $libsPath = realpath(dirname(__FILE__).'/libs');
            set_include_path($libsPath . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
    
      // -- enable autoload:
            require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
            Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    
      // -- demonstration, that autoloading feature is working:
            $mail = new Zend_Mail();
            $config = new Zend_Config(array('foo' => 'bar'));
    
            Zend_Debug::dump($mail, 'MAIL: ');
            Zend_Debug::dump($config, 'CONFIG: ');
    
      // -- cases, which will fail. Try to comment it out to determine, that it seriously cause the error.
    
      // -- 1) statical require statement:
            require_once 'Zend/XmlRpc/Value/Scalar.php';  // <-- will throw fatal error
    
      // -- 2) test if class exists:
            Zend_Debug::dump(class_exists('Zend_XmlRpc_Value_Scalar'), 'CLASS EXISTS? ');  // <-- will throw fatal error
    
      // -- 3) Use of some derived class from Zend_XmlRpc_Value_Scalar:
            $xmlString = new Zend_XmlRpc_Value_String("Hello World!");
    
    
      // -- just for test, if script came here:
            echo "Successfully ended...";

I'm seeing problems like this with Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo...

PHP Fatal error: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo::require\_once() [<function.require>]: Failed opening required 'Zend/Db/Statement/Exception.php' (include\_path='../library:../application:.:/usr/share/<a>pear:/usr/share/php</a>') in /project/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php on line 237

I'm running version 1.5 on this project.

The bootstrap uses ini\_set('include\_path', ....) rather than set\_include\_path(...). Oddly enough, when I use absolute paths for my include directories, I get a different error:

PHP Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0
