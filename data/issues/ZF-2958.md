### Description

Reported by romme @ #zftalk

usually, view helpers check $this->view->doctype->isXhtml() to choose between rendering " />" or ">" as an empty tag notation. \_hidden(), however, provides no such choice and always renders " />", which breaks validation.

Matthew, send this back if it ends up being a Doctype issue.
