### Description

Most all line endings in our generated PDF documents use a single linefeed character (LF - 0x0A). However, in a couple of places, a carriage return-linefeed sequence (CRLF - 0x0D 0x0A) is used. Both are legal in PDF, but the single linefeed is recommended.

For consistency, change all occurrences of CRLF to LF.
