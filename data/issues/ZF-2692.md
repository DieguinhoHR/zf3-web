### Description

Zend\_Db\_Profiler::queryStart() takes the first 6 characters in the query string to determine which kind of query it is. This is unsafe because a query might for example start with a parenthesis. Possible solution: check position of the words INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, and UPDATE. Whichever comes first decides what kind of query it is.
