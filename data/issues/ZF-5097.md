### Description

Dibi database layer has very usefull feature which can fetch tree array from DB according special grouping string.

Here is API doc: [http://api.dibiphp.com/dibi/DibiResult.html/…](http://api.dibiphp.com/dibi/DibiResult.html#methodfetchAssoc)

You only set somethink like this "assoc1,#,assoc2,=,assoc3,@" assoc1-3 are table colums.

And method result this array: $data[assoc1][index][assoc2]['assoc3']->value = {record}

Source code is here: [http://code.google.com/p/dibi/…](http://code.google.com/p/dibi/source/browse/trunk/dibi/libs/DibiResult.php)

This is great for grouping data, tree list (discussion), etc.

Zend\_DB already has fetchAssoc metohd, but better name for this method is fetchTree, or somethink else.
