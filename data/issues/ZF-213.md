### Description

Me again. I'm making a lot of use of Zend\_Filter\_Input atm so noticing a lot of stuff. It would be really nice if you could optionally trim all the elements of the source array.

I extended Zend\_Filter\_Input and actually did this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class SomeClass extend Zend_Filter_Input 
    {
        const TRIM = 1;
        const WHITESPACE = 2;
        /**
         * @param array $source the data you want to filter
         * @param int $trimAll data cleaning method, use class constant
         */
        public function __construct(array &$source, $cleaning) 
        {
            switch ($cleaning) {
                case self::TRIM: 
                    foreach ($source as $key => $value) {
                        if (is_string($value)) {    // preserve non-string types
                            $source[$key] = trim($value);
                        }
                    }
                    break;
                case self::WHITESPACE:
                    foreach ($source as $key => $value) {
                        if (is_string($value)) {    // preserve non-string types
                            $source[$key] = preg_replace('/\s{2,}/', ' ', $value);
                        }
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    // no action
                    break;
            }
            $this->_source = $source;
            $source = null;
        }

Extending the class for your specific purposes is exactly the right thing to do here. Since we will have a major refactoring of the filtering and validation technologies for 0.9.0, I do not want to mislead by placing this new and specific functionality into the existing design. Thus, instead of adding this to the current implementation, I have made a note to include such commonly-needed functionality into the new design.
