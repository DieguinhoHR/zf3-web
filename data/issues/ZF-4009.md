### Description

When using Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha to add reCAPTCHA to a form, submitting the form with an empty response causes an uncaught exception thrown by Zend\_Service\_ReCaptcha.

Zend\_Captcha\_Recaptcha tries to check the response and challenge values inside its isValid function:

if (!isset($context[$this->\_CHALLENGE]) || !isset($context[$this->\_RESPONSE])) { $this->\_error(self::MISSING\_VALUE); return false; }

but this will fail when the challenge or response are set to '', causing the error further down the stack inside Zend\_Service\_Recaptcha. This could be changed to:

if (!isset($context[$this->\_CHALLENGE]) || !isset($context[$this->\_RESPONSE]) || empty($context[$this->\_CHALLENGE]) || empty($context[$this->\_RESPONSE])) { $this->\_error(self::MISSING\_VALUE); return false; }

Or could be fixed higher up on the Form side of things, if necessary
