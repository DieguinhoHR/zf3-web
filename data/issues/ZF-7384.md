### Description

All ZF components should be loosly coupled and be able to be used alone without other components if possible.

Zend\_Cache\_Backend for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Create a default logger to the standard output stream
            Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Log_Writer_Stream');


A simple require\_once would be faster and would decouple it from Zend\_Loader, which makes it possible to use Zend\_Cache without Zend\_Loader. There are a few other places in Zend\_Cache where this should also be decoupled.

Method \_isReadable in class Zend\_Cache, reported in the issue ZF-2891

change to method Zend\_Loader::isReadable

This issue was basically eliminated with 1.8.1. For that version, I scrubbed all classes that used Zend\_Loader to have a check for "class\_exists()" prior to falling back on Zend\_Loader. This allows user-defined autoloading to be used, and only uses Zend\_Loader in situations where nothing was defined during autoloading.

We will not use require\_once instead, as this would lead to code duplication of the class => file resolution logic (a point that's particularly important as we start looking towards 2.0 and adopting the use of namespaces).
