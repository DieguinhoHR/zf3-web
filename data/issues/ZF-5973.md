--------------------------------------

### Description

having a configuration file like this one :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    /tmp/bla.log

`logtimestamppriorityNameprioritymessageuser<a>php://output</a>`this code fails quite well :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Xml('/config/log.xml');
    foreach ($config->writer as $writerCfg) {
        $writers[$writerCfg->name] = InnoPrim_Log_Writer_Factory::build($writerCfg);
    }


the first writerCfg element is "file", which quite not what I asked for.

did I do something wrong?

ok, a new to do it is describe here: [http://blog.riff.org/2007\_03\_19\_multiple\_entries\_wâ€¦](http://blog.riff.org/2007_03_19_multiple_entries_with_zend_config_xml)

The reason for this is, that the second level is seen as section-level, which cannot be folded into an array. You have to make your config look something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    /tmp/bla.log

`logtimestamppriorityNameprioritymessageuser<a>php://output</a>`Then you can iterate over them like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($config->writers->writer as $writerCfg) {
        $writers[$writerCfg->name] = InnoPrim_Log_Writer_Factory::build($writerCfg);
    }

I tried to iterate it but iterated on $config->writers

sorry to have bothered you.

Thanks a lot for you help!
