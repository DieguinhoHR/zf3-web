ZF-9097: appendMeta does not exist
----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-05T15:10:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-12-17T14:00:23.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I am currently updating my sites to use ZF 1.10.

I have noticed that the following code no longer works: $this->view->headMeta()->appendName('keywords', 'some keywords here'); The following error is returned: Exception information: Message: Invalid value passed to append; please use appendMeta()

As I was unable to find any information on appendMeta (searching google only brought up websites which were broken with this error) I tried: $this->view->headMeta()->appendMeta('keywords', 'some keywords here'); The following error is returned Exception information: Message: Method "appendMeta" does not exist

I'm not sure where the fault is as the documentation for v1.10 states appendName should be used.

I took a break from this and decided to have another crack at it this evening.

It turns out that if you pass it a null value it fails with this error.

My code was: $this->view->headMeta()->appendName('keywords', $content['meta\_keywords']); $this->view->headMeta()->appendName('description', $content['meta\_description']);

But if an entry did not exist in the database the value was null.

The fact that it allows an empty string, would it be possible for it to allow a null value?

Not consider this a problem, force the data type to String.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->view->headMeta()->appendName('keywords', (string) $content['meta_keywords']);

Surely it is best practice to change the code in the framework, not ask everyone to do the above?

Could simply Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta in line 408.

Current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data->content   = $content;


Change to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data->content   = (string) $content;


In case of this change, make invalid the condition in line 199.

We shouldn't enforce this in the framework. I sometimes store an object in here, and they only need to be rendered as a string at the moment of outputting, not at the moment they're being assigned.

My $0.02

Hi Dolf

Too agree in not enforce this in framework. I think that if assign a message of exception more clear, could help much (case not assigned content).
