### Description

Regarding the documentation about Creating Custom Form Markup Using Zend\_Form\_Decorator -> only one decorator of a given type may be attached to each item

at:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.8/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.8/en/zend.form.decorators.html)

it says:

An arbitrary number of decorators may be attached to each item (elements, display groups, sub forms, or the form object itself); however, only one decorator of a given type may be attached to each item.

specifically :

...however, only one decorator of a given type may be attached to each item.

It would be handy if the docs were more explicit about the meaning of 'type'.

Perhaps it should say

...however, only one decorator of a given class type may be attached to each item.

I'm not sure, but i guess that's what it means.
