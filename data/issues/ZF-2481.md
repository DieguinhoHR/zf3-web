### Description

In Zend\_Cache\_Core, certain translations of configuration parameter names were done which were removed (presumably in 1.1) and the documentation has not been updated. This results in certain features being unusable because the documentation (and examples in it) lead to exception-throwing behavior.

The cause was the removal of Zend\_Cache\_Core::$\_backwardCompatibilityArray in revision 6676.

The following translations are no longer automatically done, and anywhere the Zend\_Cache documentation says to use the left-hand string, the right-hand string must be used instead.

    cacheWithPostVariables                  cache_with_post_variables
    cacheWithSessionVariables               cache_with_session_variables
    cacheWithFilesVariables                 cache_with_files_variables

    makeIdWithPostVariables                 make_id_with_post_variables
    makeIdWithSessionVariables              make_id_with_session_variables
    makeIdWithFilesVariables                make_id_with_files_variables
    makeIdWithCookieVariables               make_id_with_cookie_variables


I found this while using cachedEntity and experimentally upgrading my ZF version. It ought to be fairly easy going, a lot of it is a search-replace job inside the documentation.

BTW, r6676 affects only 1.0.3 and later, so this is a recent bug.

only Function and Class backends were wrong in documentation

fixed in trunk and 1.0 branch

thanks

PS : these old parameters were deprecated before 1.0 release and a warning was issued if logging = true
