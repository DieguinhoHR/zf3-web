### Description

MySQL is not case sensitive with WHERE querys. But if I need for example a exact comparison where "ABC" != "abc" like on passwords, it would be great to add a option that declares weather the where clause is case sensitive or not (on Zend\_Validate\_Db\_NoRecordExists or Zend\_Validate\_Db\_RecordExists).

You have just to add a "BINARY" inside the WHERE query: WHERE password = BINARY 'safePASSWORD' or WHERE BINARY password = 'safePASSWORD'

Im closing this as not an issue for a couple of reasons.

firstly, passwords shouldn't be stored in plain text anywhere, ever, so the given usecase is flawed.

and secondly, although you have suggested a fix, this only works for MYSQL. I have looked at other methods to achieve the same, and there is no reliable cross RDBMS solution, so it is going to be up to the developer to take this into consideration, and choose a case sensitive collation when setting up fields where case sensitive matching is going to be an issue.
