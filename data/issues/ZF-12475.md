### Description

When using Zend\_Gdata to upload to youtube while behind a proxy, Zend\_Gdata\_HttpAdapterStreamingProxy throws a fatal error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Gdata\_MediaMimeStream::hasData() in Zend/Gdata/HttpAdapterStreamingProxy.php on line 118

Using the implementation of the same functionality in Zend\_Gdata\_HttpAdapterStreamingSocket the upload completes successfully.

I.e replacing the lines from 118 to 124:

 
         while ($body->hasData()) {
            if (! @fwrite($this->socket, $body->read(self::CHUNK_SIZE))) {
                require_once 'Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Exception(
                    'Error writing request to server');
            }
        }


with the following:

 
        $chunk = $body->read(self::CHUNK_SIZE);
        while ($chunk !== FALSE) {
            if (! @fwrite($this->socket, $chunk)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Exception(
                    'Error writing request to server');
            }
            $chunk = $body->read(self::CHUNK_SIZE);
        }
        $body->closeFileHandle();


fixes the issue.
