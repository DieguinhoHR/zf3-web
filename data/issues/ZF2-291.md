ZF2-291: For ZF 2.0, rename the current Zend\_Feed\_Reader parser method getLinks() - it conflicts with Zend\_Feed\_Writer using the matching method to refer to generic Atom links

### Description

Zend\_Feed\_Reader's getLinks() method does not refer to generic Atom links as would be expected. A setLinks() method added to Zend\_Feed\_Writer would. This conflict over meaning should be resolved in ZF 2.0, by renaming the current getLinks() to something more descriptive for its current usage, leaving the method name free to replace the upcoming getAllLinks() method. This is necessary to ensure a cohesive API across both Zend\_Feed components (something needed for future integration).
