### Description

Hello.

Today is great to use a Vector datatype in Adobe Flex/Flash. It's like a strong-typed Array with better performance and other features (especially with thousands objects)

It would be perfect to have a Vector support in Zend\_AMF.

Now, if you have in Flex VO with "public var users:Vector." and you send this VO to Zend\_AMF, Zend\_AMF server failed in deserialization with an exception "Unsupported type marker...".

Of course, it would be necessary to resolve how to have a Vector typed in PHP and how to resolve class-mapping (maybe some special datatype like a Zend\_DataType\_Vector?)

Thank you and good luck in the further development!
