### Description

Hi,

When I try to re-create the index, I get this error. Let me know what to do? I'm using ZendFramework-1.0.3.

PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception' with message 'chmod(): Operation not permitted' in ~/Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/Directory/Filesystem.php:189 Stack trace:

0 /var/www/daedalus/htdocs/kishore/bioethics3/Zend/Search/Lucene.php(210): Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_Directory\_Filesystem->createFile('index.lock')
=========================================================================================================================================================

1 Zend/Search/Lucene.php(171): Zend\_Search\_Lucene->\_\_construct('/var/www/daedal...', true)
==============================================================================================

2 createindex.php(16): Zend\_Search\_Lucene::create('/var/www/kishore/...')
===========================================================================

3 {main}
========

thrown in Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/Directory/Filesystem.php on line 189

I actually wrote a php script to create index, which is being called by a cron file.

I will appreciate if someone gives me a solution.

Thanks, Kishore

The problem is that it is using chmod() instead of umask(), which is probably a bad thing for a library to do. This is bad when the owner of the file is not the server user (e.g., publisher:apache or publisher:www) but you do not want to give the user (in this example, publisher) sudo rights so that it can change ownership to apache:apache.

What this should do is umask() in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_File\_Filesystem prior to the fopen() call (which is passed w+b to create the file if it does not exist). The umask should be 0111 (for the default of 0666):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $previousUmask = umask(0111);
    ...fopen(...);
    umask($previousUmask);


The call to chmod() should be removed, or at least there should be a call to fileperms() first to see if the permissions are correct. By correct, I mean between 0660 and 0777. I'm not sure why the default is 0666.

Fixed.

PS Matthew, there was an idea to use umask, but it has problems in multi-threaded environment. See also discussion at [ZF-2779].
