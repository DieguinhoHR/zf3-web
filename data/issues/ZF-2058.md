### Description

I am unable to connect to any Oracle databases using Zend\_Db's PDO OCI adapter. I am using the Oracle Instant Client connecting to a remote database. The only way I am able to connect is to expand out the dbname parameter to include a complete TNSnames.ora entry as a string.

This patch expands out the Oracle connection parameters to look like a tnsnames.ora entry as a string and sets the dbname parameter on the PDO connection string.

Is this going to make it into 1.0.3? I have commit access to Zend\_Db, can I commit this to the trunk at least?
