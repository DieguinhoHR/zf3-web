I added a pull request that fixes this:

<https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1211>

This is my first (attempts at github, and pull request) so let me know if there was anything I should have done differently

This is no longer a problem, PR [1221](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1221/files) set host as default.
