ZF-1785: App::retrieveAllEntriesForFeed accesses $this from a static context

### Description

_Summary_ Zend\_Gdata\_App::retrieveAllEntriesForFeed() is declared as static, yet it attempts to access $this->getFeed(), which is invalid. As a result, this function reliably causes a crash whenever a multi page feed is encountered.

_Regression_ Feature introduced in r5899.

_Notes_ The fix for this is simple: just declare retrieveAllEntriesForFeed() as non-static. I already have a patch tested and ready to go.

The bigger question is why this wasn't flagged in the existing unit tests. It seems that it didn't become an issue until my test Google Apps account hit around ~100 users, which suggests that the minimum number of entries required to activate paging is much higher than I had expected when designing tests.

Since the 1.0.1 code freeze is coming up shortly, I'm going to focus on getting on getting this reviewed and checked in to release-1.0. After that's taken care of I'll perform a more thorough analysis of how this slipped under the radar and what changes need to be made to existing tests to prevent this in the future.
