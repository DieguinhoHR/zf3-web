ZF-4235: Default alias for Table
--------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-09-09T15:26:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:06.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table should have ability to define default alias name for table and if defined automaticly added to every column/table name in query. Sth like: protected $\_alias = 'tableAliasName'; //

Query: SELECT tableAliasName.\* FROM tableName AS tableAliasName ORDER BY tableAliasName.orderColumn

Such option would be very helpfull to work with conditional joining other tables - no need to define aliases each time when they are needed.
