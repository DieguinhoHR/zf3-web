### Description

i've wanted to count row results to build a nice helper which organizes my index-views more comfortable.

so i've added ..

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Fetches the number of row results.
         * 
         * @return int The number of row results
         */
        public function fetchCount($where = null)
        {
            return (int)$this->_fetch('Count', $where);
        }    


.. and changed ..

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // the FROM clause
            $select->from($this->_name, array_keys($this->_cols));


.. to ..

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // the FROM clause
            if ($type == 'Count') {
                $select->from($this->_name, 'count(*)');
                $type = 'One';
            }
            else
                $select->from($this->_name, array_keys($this->_cols));


.. which gives me a Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchCount($where)-function returning the number of row results :)

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db
