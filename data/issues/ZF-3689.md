### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
         * Sets From-header and sender of the message
         *
         * @param  string    $email
         * @param  string    $name
         * @return Zend_Mail Provides fluent interface
         * @throws Zend_Mail_Exception if called subsequent times
         */
        public function setFrom($email, $name = '')
        {
            if ($this->_from === null) {
                $email = strtr($email,"\r\n\t",'???');
                $this->_from = $email;
                $this->_storeHeader('From', $this->_encodeHeader('"'.$name.'"').' <'.$email.'>', true);
            } else {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Mail_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Mail/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Mail_Exception('From Header set twice');
            }
            return $this;
        }


Currently it will always throw an exception. I don't see why I cannot set another from if I am try to send out multiple emails in a single run but with different froms.

I managed to get around this issue by extending Zend\_Mail, added my own methods for setFrom() and setSubject. In setFrom, you have to make sure to also unset $this->\_headers['From'], otherwise your email ends up with two From headers, which also works, but some MUAs screw up.

It would be nice if this made it into Zend\_Mail though, I can provide patches if wanted.

I think it depends on ZF-1626

I think clearFrom() function will solve your problem.

I add the function at SVN r13499 .
