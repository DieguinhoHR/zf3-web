### Description

The class Zend\_View\_Helper\_DeclareVars has a method declareVars() that reads its parameters with func\_get\_args(). The docblock declares a @param for variable arguments, but the function signature declares no parameters.

This is apparently legitimate coding practice according to example in <http://php.net/func-get-args>, but it break Zend\_Server\_Reflection. Zend\_Server\_Reflection\_Function::\_refect() makes an assumption that if a parameter is documented with a @param tag in the docblock, then there must be a corresponding parameter declared in the method signature.

Linking to related issue that affects Zend\_Db\_Table.

I'm re-marking this as a Zend\_Server\_Reflection bug, and re-titling the summary, as it's not really an issue with DeclareVars so much as with Zend\_Server\_Reflection not treating docblock params that are unmatched in the method signature as optional parameters.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Scheduling for next minor release.

Fixed.

Exception is thrown now if number of arguments doesn't correspond number of actual function arguments.

That should be the best solution for services.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
