ZF-1250: Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower to be encoding aware if capable
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower uses the current locale. This means that in i.e. the default "C" locale, characters such as umlaut-A (Ã„) will not be converted. I want to suggest to add a feature to set the encoding of the input string, if mb\_string is available.

I have working code for this enhancement available at: <http://andries.systray.be/StringToLower.phps>

It's important to note that, if no encoding has been provided through the ::setEncoding method, mb\_string is not required.
