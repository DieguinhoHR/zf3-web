### Description

I am running the zend command through netbeans using a keymap (Alt+Z) for Project->Zend->Run command When I am running this, my cursor is in an existing action. e.g: class UserController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action { ... public function indexAction() { // some code if($this->getRequest()- >isPost() && $form - >isValid($\_POST)){

//some more code and my cursor is here } } ..

What happens is action gets generated with the phtml file and all, but the closing brace of the above mentioned if case vanishes - in all actions of that controller. Reproduced this thrice. Tomas Mysik [tmysik@netbeans.org](mailto:tmysik@netbeans.org) 2011-09-23 10:51:59 --- Confirmed, unfortunately cannot be fixed in NetBeans, it is a bug in Zend framework. NetBeans just invokes ZF script, can be easily verified by running from command line in project folder:

zf create action test

The file is then corrupted.

Please, submit an issue against ZF itself. My ZF version:

gapon@cattie ~ $ zf show version Zend Framework Version: 1.11.10
