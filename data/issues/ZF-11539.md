### Description

Hello,

I noticed the following issue @ <http://zendframework.com/about/casestudies>

The footer div hovers over the second base pane div instead of being pushed to the bottom of the page like the other "about" pages. Scroll down about 1/4 of the page to see the issue @ Magento. This was rendered the same in Firefox 5.0 and Safari 5.0.5 and Chrome 12.0.742.112.

In trying to send an email regarding this issue @ <http://zendframework.com/contact> I was unable to submit the CONTACT FORM due to "Input error: Invalid referer" regarding the CAPTCHA plugin. On submission "Missing Captcha Fields" is returned and the email is not submitted.

I did not see any other way to contact the Zend Team so I submitted the issue here. Maybe someone can forward it to a site maintainer @ zendframework.com.

Thanks,

MG

We're getting changes to the case studies page soon; most of these are out-of-date, but I need to get approval from marketing as to whether or not to remove them and/or replace them (and content for the latter!). While I may be able to fix the layout as an interim measure, I'd rather not do so if we'll be changing the page entirely anyways.

Regarding the captcha, we were hit by ZF-10991, which I've now fixed -- and I've deployed the fix to the site.
