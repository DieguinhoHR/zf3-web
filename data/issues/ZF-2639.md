### Description

If I want set the guid attribute for the feed item - 7571-mysite.com I can't achieve this with the current implementation of the Zend\_Feed, in this current implementation I can make only

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     $feedArray['entries'][] = array(
        "guid" => "7571-mysite.com",
         "title" => iconv("iso-8859-2","utf-8",$article->getTitle()),
        ....
        ....
       );

Bug is still here from version 1.0.x till 1.8.x, why there aren't any improvements for Zend\_Feed for about a year? Another notice, It's maybe duplicate with ZF-5833.

I think there isn't any support for Zend\_Feed nowadays :-(

Just surprised it was there since Feb 2008. It was an obvious flaw with an easy fix overall. Unfortunately Zend\_Feed is a bit of a mess and it's being superseded by Zend\_Feed\_Reader, and soon Zend\_Feed\_Writer.
