ZF-4434: Unnecessary stylesheet dojo.css in $dojo->registerDojoStylesheet()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-30T21:40:47.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-07-27T09:00:53.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.1 (01/Dec/08)

### Description

The registerDojoStylesheet() method in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container, used only by Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor, is unwanted by default and can adversely affect css styled pages.

The dojo.css stylesheet is not required for themeing. It acts more like YUI's reset.css, providing boilerplate styles. It can be safely omitted without affecting Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor rendering (or any other dijit).

Workaround: Add the following to your view script AFTER creating the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor to disable importing dojo.css:

 
     <?php $this->dojo()->registerDojoStylesheet(false); ?>

I should mention that this was found in trunk rev 11557.

Resolved in trunk.

Updating these issues to mark them resolved for 1.7.1.

I just installed Zend Framework 1.10.5 with the default dojo files and it imported dojo.css by default. What is considered "resolved"?
