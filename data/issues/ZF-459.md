### Description

Hello all from japan. I try to send multi-byte character mail from Zend\_Mail, but result is bad.

Bad point of received mail is follow

=?iso-2022-jp?Q?"=1B$B=3F7=3DIE9=1B(B"=20?=[icebreaker@b-synapse.com](mailto:icebreaker@b-synapse.com)

There is not space between sendername to mailaddress

I think ...

Mail.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _addRecipientAndHeader($headerName, $name, $email)
        {
            $email = strtr($email,"\r\n\t",'???');
            $this->_addRecipient($email, ('To' == $headerName) ? true : false);
            if ($name != '') {
                $name = $this->_encodeHeader('"' .$name. '" ');   <---- matter?
            }
    
            $this->_storeHeader($headerName, $name .'<'. $email . '>', true);
        }


One space is given to encodeHeader then this space is replace to '=20' by Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable.

I think this action is bad.

Hi Naoki

Could you please attach a code snippet of your mail script so that I can replicate this? Just a single .php file will be fine.

Cheers!

Hi Simon.

I think that it is right by the following chage.

Mail.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _addRecipientAndHeader($headerName, $name, $email)
        {
            $email = strtr($email,"\r\n\t",'???');
            $this->_addRecipient($email, ('To' == $headerName) ? true : false);
            if ($name != '') {
                $name = $this->_encodeHeader('"' .$name. '"');   <---- erase space
            }
    
            $this->_storeHeader($headerName, $name .' <'. $email . '>', true);  <---- add space before '<'
        }

I've just committed a patch to subversion - could you please checkout the latest SVN version (r3290) and confirm that this issue has been resolved?
