### Description

Why not make it static so we don't have to instantiate the class just for calling this method?

bq. public _static_ function getBrowser()

We can now do bq. Zend\_Locale::getBrowser(); without getting an E\_STRICT notice.

It looks like it could be static to me anyway, but maybe I'm missing something?

This would break the backward-compatibility.

Actually we are not able to integrate this for this reason.

Breaks backward compatibility. Won't implement.

Maybe for 1.2 or later.
