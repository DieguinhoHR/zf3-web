ZF-8561: Add custom messages to Zend\_Form / Zend\_Form\_Element

### Description

I think it would be handy to be able to add custom messages (not "error messages") to forms and form elements. This could be used to add "success" messages to display using a decorator / view helper combination at the appropriate position in the form markup.

Just a thought.

In what kind of situation would you want to display such message?

If I were redisplaying a form post submission and wanted to add a message below (or before) a certain field. At the moment, I can't see a way to do this effectively, assuming all other options are exhausted (eg "description" already used).

Simple solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php if (!$this->form->isErrors()): ?>


`Thanks!`

    <?php endif; ?>

or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setDescription('

`Thanks!`

    ');

Don't forget the flash messenger too if your doing PRG. (which you should be doing anyway!)
