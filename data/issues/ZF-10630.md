ZF-10630: Zend\_Queue::send() fails when using Zend\_Queue\_Db\_Adapter with SQL Server

### Description

Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db relies on the database enforcing a unique restraint on the 'handle' column of the 'message' table. In MySQL and some other RDBMS, a UNIQUE constraint is not enforced if the value is 'null' for that column and Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db relies on this behavior.

However, other RDBMS (namely SQL Server) enforce uniqueness even if the value for that column is 'null' (i.e. you can only have one row who's value in a UNIQUE column is null). This breaks the Zend\_Queue functionality when using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv.

Specifically all inserts (all calls to Zend\_Queue->send()) fail on a UNIQUE key constraint once the queue has two or more records because the column "handle" is inserted with value 'null'.

One possible fix is to remove the UNIQUE constraint on the 'handle' column of the 'message' table in all provided .sql definition files, and then change the deleteMessage() method in Zend\_Queue\_Adapter\_Db:

public function deleteMessage(Zend\_Queue\_Message $message) { $db = $this->\_messageTable->getAdapter();

- $where = $db->quoteInto('handle=?', $message->handle);
- $where = array();
- $where[] = $db->quoteInto('message\_id=?', $message->message\_id);
- $where[] = $db->quoteInto('handle=?', $message->handle);

if ($this->\_messageTable->delete($where)) { return true; }

return false; }

Doing this, however, breaks BC for those who have already deployed, as it would require altering the DB schema.

Postponing to 2.0.

Actually the old schemas work as well. I don't perceive any break to BC.

The only conceptual difference between the provided SQL Server schema and the others is the UNIQUE constraint on 'handle'. The constraint is present in all DB schemas except for SQL Servers. But that constraint is redundant if you delete on 'message\_id' and 'handle', which is what the suggested code change does. Already deployed instances are unaffected and BC is preserved.
