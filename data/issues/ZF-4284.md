### Description

It's a critical oversight imo, that the Zend\_Mail classes do not permit the specification of a timeout value when using network-connect protocols.

As example reference, consider

Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap on line 88:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_socket = @fsockopen($host, $port);


should be replaced with a call that includes a timeout variable that can be set in the transport config.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $errno = "";
    $errstr = "";
    $this->_socket = @fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, $this->THE_TIMEOUT );


In addition, the $errno and $errstr variables should be leveraged to provide better error reporting, eg:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_socket = @fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, 10 );
    if (!$this->_socket) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception( 'cannot connect to host : ' .$errstr );
            }


This is easy to implement, and may provide more salient error reporting than 'cannot connect to host'.

Changes on constant name in SVN r12539. Because protocol can be recognizable by the class name.
