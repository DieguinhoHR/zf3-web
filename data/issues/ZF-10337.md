This is a difficult issue. I would probably force the date to be checked before it is passed to the Zend\_Validate\_Date class. But i agree the Zend\_Validate\_Date class should throw an exception when a non numeric value is found in the time (date) string.

The problem is caused by the following line in Zend\_Locale\_Format

preg\_match\_all('/\\d+/u', $number, $splitted);

All non numeric values are stripped. This causes gaps when time strings like '12:dd:12' are given. And strings like '12:d5:12' will be validated because 'd5' evaluates to '5'

To solve the issue we could validate the date string before parsing it.
