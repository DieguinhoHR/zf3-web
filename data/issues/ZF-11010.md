ZF-11010: Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover with WCF
-------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-01-30T04:54:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-29T21:17:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover's WSDL is not working with WCF (tested with 4.0). Simple solution is to change line 85 in file Zend/Soap/AutoDiscover from:

protected $\_operationBodyStyle = array('use' => 'encoded', 'encodingStyle' => "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/");

to:

protected $\_operationBodyStyle = array('use' => 'literal');

I simply created a copy of AutoDiscover.php named AutoDiscoverWCF, changed that line and then used AutoDiscoverWCF insted of AutoDiscover. Maybe someone should investigate this problem...

If thats the only thing you want to change, it is already configurable:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autodiscover->setOperationBodyStyle(array("use" => "literal"))
