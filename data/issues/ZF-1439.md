ZF-1439: Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http Should check REDIRECT\_URL before REQUEST\_URI

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http Should check REDIRECT\_URL before REQUEST\_URI - I have two use-cases for this requirement;

1) when using a controller as a 404 handler, Apache will put the original URL in REDIRECT\_URL 2) When using the mod\_rewrite PT flag, the path being passed through is put in the REDIRECT\_URL

The second comes into affect when you want to re-write URLs to ZF URLs that are actually handled by index.php via Zend\_Controller as in the default setup. This is handy if you want to alias stuff, or if you want to change the URLs without changing the code.

Attached is the 2 line patch.

The patch added in revision #5289 messed up my routing. I'm not sure if this is a Suhosin (hardened php project) specific problem, but with mod\_rewrite enabled $\_SERVER["REDIRECT\_URL"] gives me the wrong requestUri. Example (PHP 5.2.3, Suhosin-patched): <https://my.onlime.ch/index/phpinfo>

 
    <pre class="highlight">_SERVER["REDIRECT_URL"] = /index.php
    _SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]  = /index/phpinfo
    _SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]  = /index.php

where REDIRECT\_URL should be /index/phpinfo as correctly represented on my Windows box.

There have been a number of similar comments on both fw-general and fw-mvc. I am going to revert the patch and create an alternate request object that has the patched order for use in situations where developers are using Apache's 404 handler mechanism instead of rewrite rules, or using the PT flag in their rewrite rules.

Resolved in r5445. I've reverted the changes out of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http, and added a new class, Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Apache404, that extends the Http class and modifies setRequestUri() to contain the new logic. A note was added to the request section of the manual indicating when and why to use the new class.
