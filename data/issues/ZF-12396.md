ZF-12396: Cache Backend memcache und libmemcached do not store raw data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Libmemcached::save() and Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached::save()

You will find the following line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = @$this->_memcache->set($id, array($data, time(), $lifetime), $lifetime);


The Problem is that there will always an array be stored at the memcache server. There should be an option to store a raw string since automatic\_serialization has no affect here.

My hotfix is to remove time() and $lifetime. Since this results in problems for the session memcached handler i use an custom backend for the fix.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = $this->_memcache->set($id, $data, $lifetime);


In my setup im reading values stored in memcached directly using the NGINX memcached extension and the $request\_uri as memcache key. If the memcache server has a key matching the $request\_uri then the content is directly delivered to the user. This response will include time() and $lifetime values stored in memcache by the Zend Framework Backend Class. Only if the NGINX memcached Extension has no cache hit the php-fpm backend is called.

Also Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Libmemcached::load() and Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Libmemcached::test() have to be adjusted.

EQ for LOAD function:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (true === is_array($tmp)) {
        if (isset($tmp[0])) {
            return $tmp[0];
        }
        // Raw Data returned? 
    } elseif (false !== $tmp) {
        return $tmp;
    }
    return false;


I think best would be to have some option flag like options.saveRawData.
