### Description

Several classes within Zend\\Tool contain calls to \\Zend\\Filter\\FilterChain::addFilter which has apparently been renamed \\Zend\\Filter\\FilterChain::attach.

This causes zf.php to issue a fatal error.

Replaced all calls to \\Zend\\Filter\\FilterChain::addFilter with \\Zend\\Filter\\FilterChain::attach (within the \\Zend\\Tool namespace)

I missed the pull request when I first looked at the issue. However, I've patched the master branch, both with the fixes to Zend\\Tool as well as to other classes that utilized FilterChain (including Zend\\Markup and Zend\\Form\\Decorator).
