ZF-3749: Zend\_Translate with the gettext adapter returns an unexpected result when called with an empty string

### Description

When Zend\_Translate (used with the gettext adapter) is fed an empty string, it returns a long string of header file information (see ZF-2914). This is the normal behaviour.

However, when Zend\_Form uses Zend\_Translate in a similar context, the output is not appropriate.

For example, if I have a list for which I want the first entry to be empty (so there is no default selection made), the label of that first entry (an empty string) is being translated by the gettext adapter to the string of system info. This is obviously not what I want.

Eg:

 
    <pre class="literal">$form->birthYear->addMultiOption('', '');
    
    or 
    
    $form->birthYear->addMultiOption(null, null);


Will output something like

 
    <pre class="literal">Project-Id-Version: removed
    Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: 
    POT-Creation-Date: 2008-07-23 22:23-0500

    Last-Translator: removed
    Language-Team: 
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
    X-Poedit-Language: English
    X-Poedit-Country: CANADA
    X-Poedit-SourceCharset: utf-8
    X-Poedit-KeywordsList: translate
    X-Poedit-Basepath: removed
    X-Poedit-SearchPath-0: removed


I believe this behaviour, which has been corrected for fieldset labels (ZF-2913), should also be corrected for field labels.

Thank you.

For your information: This is not a bug of Zend\_Translate.

When gettext files are compiled with poEdit the editor adds it's own information as translation of an empty string. ALL translations are used and returned, of course also an empty translation.

So the general question is:

Do we want to suppress the informations when they are provided ? Or do we change Zend\_Form to "not translate" empty strings.

Suppressing the informations raise another possible problems... other editors could add such information in a different translation. As mentioned this is a poEdit ONLY problem which adds this information as translation for an empty string.

As Thomas notes, this is not a bug in Zend\_Translate, and Zend\_Translate is only doing Zend\_Form's bidding; ultimately, it's a poEdit issue.

I'm closing this, as there's no reasonable solution on the framework side.

New feature implemented with r10517.

Empty translations are now suppressed by the gettext adapter. Adapter informations can be retrieved with the new 'getAdapterInfo()' method.
