### Description

On the following page of the Zend\_Date documentation there is a little typo:

[[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.creation.html)]

Under _9.5.1. Create the actual date_, in the first paragraph it reads:

"_You can _eigther_ create a new instance_," when it should read "_You can _either_ create a new instance_."
