ZF-7582: Supress Auto Handling of Exceptions
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-08-13T06:41:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:21.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When the invoked method throws an exception, the server automatically catches to call the servers fault method.

This prohibits users of the server to handle the exception more gracefully/generally.

Attached is a patch which introduces a autoHandleExceptions option. If this is aceptable, i also could provide the tests for it.
