ZF-8052: SoapClient is unable to handle <xsd:import>

### Description

Create a new Zend\_Soap\_Client\_\* that can handle .

 
    <pre class="highlight">www.example.com/service?xsd=1">
            
        ...


 
    <pre class="highlight">

SoapClient seems to be unable to handle and is causing an endless loop.

Workaround: \* download WSDL and XSD files \* change schemaLocation-URLs to local files \* initialize SoapClient with modified WSDL file

Works fine, but I don't know whether this is the best way to solve this problem.

Do you already have code for this? then please contribute it :-)

Does this bug appear on PHPs SoapClient also? If yes, please report a bug on php.net

It has nothing todo with these elements. The problem is, that the JAX-WS server seems to be unable to handle HTTP/1.0 requests and sends HTTP/1.1 responses. Changing HTTP version to 1.1 didn't help (SoapFault: <a href="">www.php.net/stream\_context\_create</a>" rel="nofollow">WSDL] SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from "..."). It's required to set "Connection: close" header using a stream context ([stream\_context\_create()).

 
    <pre class="highlight">$context = stream_context_create(array(
        'http' => array('header' => 'Connection: close')
    ));
    
    $client = new Zend_Soap_Client('', array(
        'soap_version'   => SOAP_1_1,
        'stream_context' => $context
    ));
