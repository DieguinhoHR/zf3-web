ZF-12430: Implement support for InputFilterProviderInterface on Forms
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Form extends Fieldset so one would expect to have the same capability to implement InputFilterProviderInterface and getInputFilterSpecification method.

This would make things consistent rather them implementing own logic in prepare().

Now I've this at the end of prepare() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $Factory     = new \Zend\InputFilter\Factory();
    $InputFilter = $Factory->createInputFilter($this->getInputFilterSpecification());
    
    $this->setInputFilter($InputFilter);

This is actually for ZF2, I really don't know anymore how can I create issue for ZF2. Maybe I lost my rights? I don't have "Zend Framework 2" in list of project at Create Issue.

Please move under ZF2 if you are capable.
