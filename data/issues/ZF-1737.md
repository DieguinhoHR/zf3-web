### Description

The example here doesn't work [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.multiple-emails.html)

Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp does not even have connect() or disconnect() methods!

The transport itself automatically creates a connection when sending the first email -- it provides no mechanism for doing so beforehand.

Perhaps the example should include something like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $conn = new Zend_Mail_Protocol_Smtp($host, $port);
    $conn->connect();
    
    $tr = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp;
    $tr->setConnection($conn);
