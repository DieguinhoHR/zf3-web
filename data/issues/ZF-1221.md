ZF-1221: Improve Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::fetchRow() docblock for IDE support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The current docblock for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::fetchRow() contains:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    * @return Zend_Db_Table_Row_Abstract|null The row results per the
    *     Zend_Db_Adapter fetch mode, or null if no row found.


It would be better for auto-completion within IDEs (well, PDT at least) if it contained:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    * @return Zend_Db_Table_Row_Abstract (or null) The row results per the
    *     Zend_Db_Adapter fetch mode, or null if no row found.


(or similar)

For what it's worth, the phpdoc manual says that it's okay to list multiple types together in the @param and @return tags, separated by the pip symbol (|).

[http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/â€¦](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/earthli/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.return.pkg.html)

There is also an instance in the documentation above of a list containing a class name and 'false' which is a value, not a type name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * example of using @return with a class name
     * @param integer even or odd integer
     * @return Parser|false phpDocumentor Parser object or error
     */


So phpdoc clearly permits (and even encourages) some forms that PDT doesn't understand.

Should we therefore use 'mixed' whenever we have these cases, and then list the possible types and values in the following text, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    * @return mixed Zend_Db_Table_Row_Abstract or null; the row results per the
    *     Zend_Db_Adapter fetch mode, or null if no row found.


In the example above, the PDT won't parse Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract at all, it'll just know 'mixed' as the return type in cases like this.
