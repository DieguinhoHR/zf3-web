ZF-3803: Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page shouldn't check if headers have been sent

### Description

I currently have an application that won't cache headers unless I remove the check for headers\_sent().

headers\_sent() should not be checked in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page since headers have not been sent if output buffering is enabled. headers\_list() provides the list of headers regardless if they have been sent or not, so it's safe to call headers\_list() regardless.

may you provide a patch for this ?

I don't really understand why it's a critical bug ?

What options do you use for the frontend ?

It sounds to be a very specific problem...

It's a critical bug because when I tell the page cache to memorize headers (or just the content-type header for 1.5.3), it doesn't. The code below is from my bootstrap:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myPageCache = new Zend_Cache_Frontend_Page(array(
        'content_type_memorization' => true,
        'default_options'           => array(
            'cache' => false,
        ),
        'regexps'                   => array(
            '^' . $myConfig->baseUrl . '/~(.*?)/(.*)$' => array(
                'cache'                             => true,
                'cache_with_session_variables'      => true,
                'cache_with_cookie_variables'       => true,
                'make_id_with_get_variables'        => false,
                'make_id_with_post_variables'       => false,
                'make_id_with_session_variables'    => false,
                'make_id_with_files_variables'      => false,
                'make_id_with_cookie_variables'     => false,
            ),
        ),
    ));
    
    $myPageCache->setBackend($myCache);
    $myPageCache->start();


With the current Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page from 1.5.3, 1.6RC2, or trunk, headers aren't cached. If I apply the patch that I've attached, headers are cached correctly.

ok, and you use output buffering (by yourself) + Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page (which use output buffering too)

and using both reach to this bug ? I'm right ?

Nope. I'm not starting any output buffering other than what's started by Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page.
