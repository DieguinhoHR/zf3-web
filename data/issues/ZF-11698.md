### Description

I have a class which extends Zend\_Acl and sets up a lot of default permissions for my application. There are times when I need to re-set the permissions back to a default and to do so I'm trying to call "$this->removeAllow();" and "$this->removeDeny();".

Both calls seem to output the notice as listed in the title.

Dropped priority to minor, as there is no loss of functionality just an annoying E\_NOTICE.

Could you please provide a short sample which reproduces your issue? I've been using Zend\_Acl in situations similar to what you describe and haven't encountered any notices being emitted because allPrivileges is undefined.

Could not reproduce against trunk. Please reopen this ticketif you can provide additional information that would help reproduce the issue.

I have the same problema.

Look for this example code. Ist result in error quote in top:
-------------------------------------------------------------

$acl = new Zend\_Acl(); $acl->addResource('padrao'); $acl->addRole('usuario'); $acl->allow('usuario', 'padrao', 'acessar'); echo $acl->isAllowed('usuario', 'padrao', 'acessar') . "\\n  
"; $acl->removeAllow(); echo $acl->isAllowed('usuario', 'padrao', 'acessar') . "\\n  
";
