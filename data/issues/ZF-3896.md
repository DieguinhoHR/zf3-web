### Description

In Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset line 73, the line $options = array\_merge($options, $attribs);

should be

$options = array\_merge($attribs, $options);

This is because the current version overwrites specified attribs if they are the same as the Form.

For example, let's take a form:

$form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->setAttrib ( 'class', 'FormClass' ); $form->addDecorator('Fieldset',array('class'=>'FieldsetClass'));

The fieldset would be rendered with the FormClass instead of FieldsetClass as expected.

I confirm the bug AND the fix to be functional with release 1.7.4. It's not just Zend\_Form, any other form object using the "Fieldset" decorator will generate this problem.
