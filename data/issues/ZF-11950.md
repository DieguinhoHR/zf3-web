ZF-11950: Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader handles plugin names with underscores incorrectly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-12-19T14:43:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-02-26T18:34:05.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader uses its \_formatName() method to convert received plugin name into part of target class name. As of v1.11.11 it looks like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _formatName($name)
    {
        return ucfirst((string) $name);
    }


However this code will produce incorrect result in a case if given plugin name contains underscore character. For example attempting to load "foo\_bar" plugin will result it attempt to load Prefix/Foo/bar.php file instead of Prefix/Foo/Bar.php because only first component of plugin name is capitalized.

Correct version of this method can be for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _formatName($name)
    {
        return str_replace(' ','_',ucwords(str_replace('_',' ',$name)));
    }


This change will not have side effects since it is protected method and its result for short names without underscores will be identical to current version of method.

@[~matthew]: is this something that can be fixed in v1.12? If so I can provide a patch.
