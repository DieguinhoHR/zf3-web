### Description

I have configured Multidb with CacheManager as per documentation (see below). No errors in logs, full access to filesystem, everything should work like charm, the only problem is that no cache is created...

1) CacheManager configuration: resources.cachemanager.database.frontend.name = Core resources.cachemanager.database.frontend.customFrontendNaming = false resources.cachemanager.database.frontend.options.lifetime = 7200 resources.cachemanager.database.frontend.options.automatic\_serialization = true resources.cachemanager.database.backend.name = File resources.cachemanager.database.backend.customBackendNaming = false resources.cachemanager.database.backend.options.cache\_dir = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../temp/cache" resources.cachemanager.database.frontendBackendAutoload = false

2) Multidb configuration: resources.multidb.defaultMetadataCache = "database"

resources.multidb.db1.adapter = "pdo\_mysql" resources.multidb.db1.host = "localhost" resources.multidb.db1.username = "webuser" resources.multidb.db1.password = "XXXX" resources.multidb.db1.dbname = "db1" resources.multidb.db1.default = true

resources.multidb.db2.adapter = "pdo\_pgsql" resources.multidb.db2.host = "example.com" resources.multidb.db2.username = "dba" resources.multidb.db2.password = "notthatpublic" resources.multidb.db2.dbname = "db2"

Exists a problem before 1.11.1 but already was fixed. See here a reproduce <https://gist.github.com/1129015>.

Why this issue was closed? It is not fixed at all... I am expecting caching files to be created in APPLICATION\_PATH "/../temp/cache", but instead it does nothing!
