### Description

There is a typo, or maybe leftover after earlier versions of framework, in Zend\_Controller\_Front::getDispatcher() phpDocs at line 450 \* @return Zend\_Controller\_DispatcherInteface It should be fixed to \* @return Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface in order to correct code completion.

Hehe, it is fixed only partially - typo still exists.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    * @return Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Inteface
