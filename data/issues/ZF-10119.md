The test case that fail because of a max execution time exceeded

And a patch that solve the problem

Maybe there is a reason with the "u" modifier was there, so, maybe it's not the good solution, but in any case, like that, the test pass

Thanks!

Best regards,

Raphaël Dehousse

Without the "u" modifier any unicode regex will fail. This is a negotation of existing functionality.

Therefor this patch is not accepted.

Added UTF8 tests. Patch works as expected and has been added.
