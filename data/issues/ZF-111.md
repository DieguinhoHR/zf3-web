### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/124>

Process, scan, etc. all pending CLAs.

Publish names of contributors with CLAs that submit code, examples, documentation, etc. along with their key areas of responsibility.

Motivation: Contributors should not use any intellectual property (e.g. code patches) from those who have not yet signed the CLA.

This appears to be complete to what we are going to do, confirm and resolve it.

CLA names are not published, but are available for those active in the issue tracker, SVN and other places they can make changes. No need for a list since the system now provides the information via a security group.

I think publishing key areas of responsibility along with the names of contributors is a good idea. For one it will allow people interested in providing a feedback to quickly locate an author or a responsible person (surely not everybody will like to dig the svn commit messages). And of course everyone will get appriopriate credit for what they in fact did for the framework.

We're proposing an alternative to keeping a list of key areas of responsibility and contributor names and contributions:

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend+Framework+Components+-+Developer+Notes)

Each group involved in a particular component can keep that component's dev notes wiki page up-to-date.
