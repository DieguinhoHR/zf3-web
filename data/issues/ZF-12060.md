### Description

Hi,

Similar with adding charset option I think worth to add as well an option to set the db timezone.

Currently this option is possible to be set with something like this:

'driver\_options'=>array('MYSQLI\_INIT\_COMMAND' => "set time\_zone = '+00:00'")

But this is MYSQLI only setting so I suggest to add a way to set this easily no matter what adapter is in use.
