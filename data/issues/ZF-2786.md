### Description

Currently, on line 915 of Zend\_Form\_Element, a call to ReflectionClass::newInstanceArgs() can fail with a catchable fatal error if the options passed to addValidator() are not in an array.

This can be rectified in one of two ways: \* typehint $options as an array \* case $options to an array at the time that the call is made

This is true also of addFilter().
