ZF-5871: Author element not optional
------------------------------------

### Description

Atom specification says a feed MUST have an author element, whether at the entry level or at the feed level. Documentation of Zend\_Feed::importArray() says: 'author' => 'author/publisher of the feed', //optional but if author is not specified in every entry, the resulting feed is not valid. Nowadays element is not supported (but there's a patch in bug ZF-5611), so: - include that patch and specify 'required' on $array['entries'][$i]['author'] - or correct docs and specify 'required' on $array['author']

Unfortunately, the specifications aren't adhered to in Zend\_Feed so it would impose a massive backwards compatibility break to require it right now. I'm marking this as "Won't Fix" solely for that reason. Zend\_Feed\_Writer will impose a strict view of the specs, but Zend\_Feed is going to have to remain as is until we know about it's status for Zend Framework 2.0.
