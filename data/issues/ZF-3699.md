ZF-3699: Broken url handling in library/Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In file library/Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php, revision from 2008-07-18:12:08 GMT +1

Line 751:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if ($rUri['path'] != urldecode($cUri['path'])) {
        return false;
      }


should be changed to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if ($rUri['path'] != $cUri['path']) {
        return false;
      }


Looks like there is code that already is taking care to urlencode $rUri['path'] so there is no need for $cUri['path'] to be decoded.

Please close also bug report: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3066>

Since it's no longer valid for the latest SVN version of the adapter.

Seems to be fixed already.
