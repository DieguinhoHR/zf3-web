### Description

When we use format for Zend\_Date which use escaped part it is not works. Example:

include\_once 'Zend/Date.php'; Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('format\_type' => 'php')); $now = Zend\_Date::now(); echo $now->toString('\\Y\\e\\a\\r: Y');

Expected:

Year: 2010

And why is this a bug? The backslash is no proper character for date formats within Zend\_Date.

I think the point is that one can't escape letters, to make sure they're displayed on as-is basis.

But a feature which is not supported is not a bug. It's a not supported feature.

So "new feature" would be the expected issuetype in my opinion.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.constants.html#zend.date.constants.phpformats) There absent information about this behavior, then i expect 100% working of my old php date formats.

Lets add some information to documentation.
