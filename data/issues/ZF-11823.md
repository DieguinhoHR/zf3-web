### Description

I'm using Zend\_Cache as Session Handler, which works fine. I'm not sure where this issue was introduced, but every time when the automatic\_cleaning\_factor will remove old keys, I'll see the following error:

Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'CLEANING\_MODE\_OLD' in library/Zend/Cache/Core.php on line 0 Call Stack: 1.0006 14868608 1. My\_Session\_SaveHandler\_ZendCache->write() library/My/Session/SaveHandler/ZendCache.php:0 1.0006 14868920 2. Zend\_Cache\_Core->save() library/My/Session/SaveHandler/ZendCache.php:29

I'm calling Zend\_Cache\_core with liek the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">   public function write($id, $sessionData) {
            $this->cache->save($sessionData, $id, array() , $this->maxLifetime);
            return true;
        }

Where $this->cache is a cache from cachemanager, in my exampel with Zend\_Cache\_Core as frontend and Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcache as backend.

I think this issue is related to ZF-11463. See [this comment](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11463?focusedCommentId=47397&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-47397).

In that issue, the same sort of error manifests itself ("undefined class constant" error), and happens because the write and close session handlers are called after object destruction, and therefore the objects no longer have class constants. In the comment i've linked to above, the poster suggests a workaround which worked his case. Could you try it for your case and report back the result?
