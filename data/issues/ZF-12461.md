ZF-12461: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_PlaylistVideoEntry::getVideoId() gives wrong id
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When using playlists to list videos using Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_PlaylistVideoEntry the getVideoId() returns the playlist video id instead of the actual video id.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $playlist = $yt->getPlaylistVideoFeed('<a href="https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/playlists/PLB64B76A0570E8A46">https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/â€¦</a>');
    foreach ($playlist as $i=>$video) {
        echo $video->getVideoId() . ' ' . $video->getVideoTitle() ."\n";
    }


This looks like an upstream issue with Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_VideoEntry::getVideoId()

Are you in a position to sign the CLA and supply a patch?

I don't know enough about the internal workings of zend to feel confident in submitting a patch. My workaround right now is to parse getVideoThumbnails() for the video id.

Using the verry buggy YouTube Data API Demo <http://gdata.youtube.com/demo/index.html> you can put the request URI as /feeds/api/playlists/PLB64B76A0570E8A46 and see the video id's are at .
