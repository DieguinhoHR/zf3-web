ZF-10368: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action & preDispatch hooks
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-08-23T07:19:13.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:40.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action, preDispatch events aren't being fired properly for the action being run. For instance, when using registered Action helpers (derived from Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract) with preDispatch functions, the hooks work properly. However, when using Controller Plugins (derived from Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract) with those same preDispatch hooks, the functions won't get run.

When using a \_forward call within a action, the preDispatch hooks always work properly.

This happends with postDispatch as well as other hooks as well.
