ZF-8429: Inconsistent directory separator in include paths for Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader cache file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

After following the "[Using the PluginLoader class file include cache](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.pluginloader.html#zend.loader.pluginloader.performance.example)" example, I've noticed that there is inconsistent directory separators used within the generated "include file" cache script, for example

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    // data/pluginLoaderCache.php
    include_once 'Zend/Filter/Word\CamelCaseToDash.php';
    include_once 'Zend/Filter/StringToLower.php';


I'm sure this is due to the fact that I'm developing on a Windows host however I can't see why only some entries are using the backslash. This will also cause issues if I deploy this file to a Linux host.

Certainly, this is very annoying when you are developing on a Windows machine but your production server is Linux. I hope this gets fixed in the next release.

Also check my SF question which concerns this exact bug: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4458675/â€¦](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4458675/odd-unknown-error-with-zend-loader-pluginloadersetincludefilecache)

Patch with test attached. Since include/require on all platforms (including windows) accepts forward slashes, the patch simply normalizes all cached include paths to use forward slashes.
