### Description

Windows 7 32bit, PHP 5.3.8, PHPUnit 3.4.15, ZF revision 24790

 
    <pre class="highlight">There were 2 failures:
    
    1) Zend_Filter_HtmlEntitiesTest::testStripsUnknownCharactersWhenEncodingMismatchDetected
    Failed asserting that  contains """".
    
    W:\zf\tests\Zend\Filter\HtmlEntitiesTest.php:241
    
    2) Zend_Filter_HtmlEntitiesTest::testRaisesExceptionIfEncodingMismatchDetectedAndFinalStringIsEmpty
    Expected exception from single non-utf-8 character
    
    W:\zf\tests\Zend\Filter\HtmlEntitiesTest.php:257

Problem is that latin1 dash is happily encoded into HTML — and therefore it's not removed in 1 and exception is not thrown in 2. Not really sure why this happens. The content is safely escaped but the tests make wrong assumptions. Based on that I marked the issue as Minor.
