### Description

I'd like to see a public visibility version of Zend\_Loader::\_securityCheck(). There could just be a publicly visible alias, Zend\_Loader::securityCheck(), that calls the protected version, to maintain bc. It's not much code to copy into another function, which is what I've done, but it seems like it might be useful to have generally available.
