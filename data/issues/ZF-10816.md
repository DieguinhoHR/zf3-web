### Description

If the Upload-Validator detects an error in a multifile upload, it will return this error in the subsequent files, even if this error is does not apply to this File. The problem is, that the same Validator-Object is used for all validations, and the message and error-container is not cleared. So for example an empty entry stops all further validators on the subsequent entries.

Inserting the '\_setValue' at the begin of the 'isValid'-Method fixes this Problem:

public function isValid($value, $file = null) { $this->\_setValue($value); ...
