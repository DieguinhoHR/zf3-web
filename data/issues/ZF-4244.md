### Description

I use actionStack helper in init() method (to create menu links and capture it's content). I also use ContextSwitch helper to make one action for ajax (json). Now, even when I try AjaxContext, when I call action with ajax call (?format=json) server returns 500 Internal Server error. When I removed actionStack from init() method it works well. Example code below.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class EditorController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->_helper->actionStack('menu', 'navigation');
    
            $contextSwitch = $this->_helper->getHelper('ContextSwitch');
            $contextSwitch->addActionContext('load', 'json')
                          ->initContext();
        }
    
        public function indexAction()
        {
        }
    
        public function loadAction()
        {
        }


Call to /editor/load/format/json makes response unreachable.

However i found that I can workaround it this way (part of init():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $actionContext = $contextSwitch->getActionContexts($this->_request->getActionName());
            if (!in_array('json', $actionContext)) {
                $this->_helper->actionStack('menu', 'navigation');
            }


...but I think it should be automated, isn't it?

What's happening here is that a context is activated -- which sets a new view script suffix. As a result, any later actions on the ActionStack are now using that altered view script suffix -- and likely do not have matching view scripts.

There are a few solutions. Probably the best, though, is simply to clear the action stack when a context is detected. You can do this with code like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (null !== $this->_helper->contextSwitch->getCurrentContext()) {
        $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        if ($front->hasPlugin('Zend_Controller_Plugin_ActionStack')) {
            $plugin = $front->getPlugin('Zend_Controller_Plugin_ActionStack');
            $registry = $plugin->getRegistry();
            unset($registry[$plugin->getRegistryKey()]);
        }
    }


If you swap the "$this->\_helper->contextSwitch" part with "Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('ContextSwitch')", you could even push that into a postDispatch() plugin.

That's not working as it should. You shouldn't unset the whole key in the registry otherwise you'll get "Notice: Undefined index: Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_ActionStack in ./Zend\_svn/Zend/Plugin/ActionStack.php on line 136"

instead unset($registry[$plugin->getRegistryKey()]); it should be $registry->{$plugin->getRegistryKey()} = array();

My ZF is: r12605

Resolved as Won't Fix on the basis of there being a known workaround since 2008.
