ZF-6567: Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap does not inherit parent application's pluginPaths

### Description

When using Zend\_Application's Modules resource to allow for module-specific bootstrapping, all of the parent bootstrap's configuration options are passed to the module bootstraps, except for its plugin paths.

This appears to be because the pluginPaths key is removed from the options array prior to the options being stored in Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract.php (see esp. line 121).

The net result of this is that the parent bootstrap's plugin loader has all the appropriate paths, but these paths never get passed on appropriately to the module bootstrappers. Because of this, applications using custom plugin resource classes will experience a fatal exception when the module bootstrappers are loaded in: e.g.,

Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Exception: Plugin by name 'Customresourcename' was not found in the registry; used paths: Zend\_Application\_Resource\_: Zend/Application/Resource/ in /path/to/zf/library/Zend/Loader/PluginLoader.php on line 390

This has been tested against revision 15373 of the trunk.

Still a problem in rev. 15555 of Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract. Can be solved by copying pluginPaths from application instance in the constructor.

Oops, sorry, there's no problem. But you should write about using Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap for module bootstraps in documentation :)
