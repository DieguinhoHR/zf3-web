### Description

The constructor is currently private and should be protected to get extended classes working under php 5.2.6.

But they ARE made private to be not extended... I would think this is expected behaviour and not a issue.

    /**
     * Singleton pattern implementation makes "new" unavailable
     *
     * @return void
     */


not in every case. Some of them are singleton implementations and they should be extendable.

Indeed, Zend\_Auth should be extensible, and this issue should be resolved for this component. I'm not sure why Zend\_InfoCard would not be extensible with a private constructor, so I'll look into this, too. I'll defer to [~alexander] about Zend\_Search\_Lucene. [~ralph] and I should also have a look at Zend\_Session, but I recall that there were design reasons for its private members.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene is not intended to be extensible, but its constructor is public. Zend\_Search\_Lucene objects should be created using open()/create() Zend\_Search\_Lucene static methods, but 'new' operator is not disabled (constructor is not switched to private) to be compatible with previous Zend\_Search\_Lucene implementations.

Removing Zend\_Search\_Lucene from affected components list.
