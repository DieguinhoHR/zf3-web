### Description

Name of API affected: VideoQuery.php: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_VideoQuery()->setFeedType()

Issue summary: The "responses" and "comments" types construct invalid URLs by concatenating as follows: \* responses: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube::VIDEO\_URI . '/' . $videoId . 'responses' \* comments: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube::VIDEO\_URI . '/' . $videoId . 'comments' This generates illegal URLs such as "https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/SZj6rAYkYOgcomments" The "related" type constructs a valid URL in contrast: \* related: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube::VIDEO\_URI . '/' . $videoId . '/related';

Solution: To fix this bug for the responses and comments types, simply change their concatenation lines to: \* responses: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube::VIDEO\_URI . '/' . $videoId . '/responses' \* comments: Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube::VIDEO\_URI . '/' . $videoId . '/comments'

Seems this issue tracker is dead. I've reported it here instead: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/issues/3351>

@Aitte No, this tracker is not dead! This is the tracker for version 1 and the tracker on Github is for version 2.
