ZF-6976: Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain doesn't reset pathInfo in request
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-10T07:50:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-01-19T15:07:20.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Let's suppose we're trying to match the following URL: /part1/part2/part3a And we have the following chains: part1->part2->part3a part1->part2->part3b

Last chain tries to match our URL and fails on the last part. Then first chain tries to match... but not the whole URL, because $request->getPathInfo() returns only part3a now! The solution is to call $request->setPathInfo($path) before returning false from inside the foreach() that iterates the routes, not only after finishing the foreach().

P.S.: I tried to avoid patching the ZF source by extending Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain with my custom class, but Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract cannot be tuned to use my class in chain() method - it's hardcoded there.

Important notice: this bug occurs only if part3b route's getVersion() returns 2 or greater.

This patch solves the problem.

I'm having the same issue... It affects (at least) version 1.10

Although this patch does fix the problem related to the Chain route, the problem might be more related to modifying the Request\_Http object. Actually changing the Request\_Http object to pass along some modifications seems to be a bit misplaced or am I missing something important??

Using the actual request object in a route (version 2) seems feasible, but it might not be when dealing with chained routes. Any thoughts?

The provided patch solves the problem. The chain class is calling $request->setPathInfo($path) in case that it finds match, but it doesn't do it when not (places where return false; is calles).

I am providing test where it is shown how evaluating route A is influencing route B evaluation.

Output of this test is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1. test matches, path info=/xxx/too
    B route matches: yes
    2. test fails which is correct, path info=xxx/too
    A route matches: no
    3. test fails which is wrong, reason is that the route A has change path info=too
    B route matches: no
    finished.
