### Description

if you set locale to ar\_SA it will have date array returns instead of integer, if you changed the locale to 'ar' or 'ar\_JO' it will work normally.

I got the following two lines code from magento 1.6.2:

$filter = new Zend\_Filter\_LocalizedToNormalized(array('locale' => 'ar\_SA')); $cartData[$index]['qty'] = $filter->filter(5);

to fix this issue I have removed the following block from ar\_SA.xml

\#0.###;#0.###-

and everything worked normally now.
