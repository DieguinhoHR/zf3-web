ZF-6013: Zend\_Test generates vague failure messages

### Description

There was 1 failure:

1) testExpiredPasswordForcesPasswordChange(Default\_AuthControllerTest) Failed asserting last controller used was "auth"

This message could be a lot more explict. e.g. Failed asserting last controller used ("index") was "auth"

The same goes for the redirect failures as well. PHPUnit itself always gives very explicit failure messages - "Failed asserting 0 equals 1".

Matthew,

I could improve these easily. Should I add a patch first here

Till -- yes, please do. Make sure the patch includes changes to the unit tests so I don't have to hunt those down.
