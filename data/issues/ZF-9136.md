### Description

We're using our Resource Mail transport, that only log mails (we can also commit this transport to main ZF).

But after migration to 1.10 there is problem with loading this transport.

Problem is in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Mail - transport type shouldn't be lowercased, due to loading problem.

I've attached solution.

We signed Corp CLA, so you can use it.

Thank you for reporting this issue.

It should now have been resolved on trunk and the 1.10 release branch, and will as such be released with the next mini release (1.10.2). Please check and verify if all is working for you.

Also, I wasn't able to come up with a decent unittest (to ensure it won't get broken 'ever' again without anyone noticing), so if you have any ideas for a unit test, please do leave that in a comment.
