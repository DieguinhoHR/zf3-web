ZF-7394: Zend\_Filter\_Input disregards field 'messages' meta-command
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Input disregards custom error messages passed to it via the 'messages' meta-command. This has been working previously but has been broken since the 1.8 ver. release.

For example, the following validators array:

 
       $validators = array(
        'name' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter your name'),
        'subject' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter a subject'),
        'email' => array('EmailAddress','messages' => 'Please enter a valid Email address'),
        'content' => array('NotEmpty','messages' => 'Please enter message contents')
    );


Returns the following message stack:

array(5) { ["name"] => array(1) { ["isEmpty"] => string(48) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'name'" } ["subject"] => array(1) { ["isEmpty"] => string(51) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'subject'" } ["content"] => array(1) { ["isEmpty"] => string(51) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'content'" } ["email"] => array(1) { [0] => string(24) "You must give a non-empty value for field 'content''" } }

I confirmed this bug. I have same problem with default error messages. In v.1.7.8 all work's fine.

This bug occurs only with the "NotEmpty" validator. Other seem to work fine.

@Julien: that's not quite my experience. Consider:

$validators = array( 'email' => array( 'NotEmpty', 'EmailAddress', new Zend\_Validate\_Regex('/.+nys[dp].uscourts.gov$/i'), 'messages'=>array( 'Email is required', 'Email address is malformed', 'Email domain must be either nysd.uscourts.gov or nysp.uscourts.gov'), 'breakChainOnFailure'=>true,

 
             ),


); $input = new Zend\_Filter\_Input(null,$validators, array( 'email'=>'barf' ) );

if (! $input->isValid()) { print\_r($input->getMessages()); }

outputs the default error message instead of the one I (try to) pass in:

( [email] => Array ( [emailAddressInvalidFormat] => 'barf' is not a valid email address in the basic format local-part@hostname )

)

@David: You don't use the same notation as Eran... Your problem is different than Eran's.

I don't quite understand why it would matter. It looks like my general problem is "it doesn't work," i.e., can't get Zend\_Filter\_Input to let me override the default error messages when there's more than one rule on a field. In any case, is my issue something already in the tracker or should I file one? And... do you know if there are any plans to address this issue and/or mine?

\*) When something is different coded than also the issue is different \*) That it does not work is not true... using another notation there is no problem at all \*) There is already another issue for your notation... a simple search would have shown you this \*) As you have seen I took over this issue 6 days ago \*) I can not solve 80 issues at the same time so please be patient as already mentioned several times... one after the oher will be solved

\*) Reasonable minds may disagree, but I would respectfully submit that when code that conforms to the documented API runs faultlessly in one version of the ZF but generates undesired output in a subsequent version, it can fairly be said that something "doesn't work," and \*) I searched in good faith for the issue, with negative results, perhaps because \*) your understanding of the issues greatly exceeds my own, which is why you're a contributor and I, a mere consumer, who \*) failed to notice you took on the issue so recently, and who, in any event, suggests that you \*) please relax and accept my sincere gratitude for your exertions.

@David: LOL

Let's say: I will solve them soon, ok ?

Your issue is related to ZF-7034 (using one element with multiple validators and messages). Internally I have fixed it already so there is a solution for it soon.

This issue (using multiple elements with one validator and message) could be fixed but I can only verify when I've finished the other one.

When all is ok, then there is a solution within one day. Does this sound good to you ? ;-)

Fixed with r17845.

And sorry that I was wrong... not one day but only some hours :-)
