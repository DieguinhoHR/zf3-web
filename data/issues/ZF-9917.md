### Description

In both validation components a filter instance is used without configuration besides allowWhitespace.

So when unicode is enabled they both perform a preg match with unicode letter and number properties. So testing against a real alphanumeric string isnt possible..

Maybe make it so that alnum tests by default on the english alphabet, and alpha like it does in the current form.

Zend\_Validate\_Alnum and Alpha do not test on filter defaults, they test against the Environment.

Unicode values ARE "Real" alphanumeric strings.

Example: "Höchstens 10 mal Ärger" is a real alphanumeric string even if you don't think so.. and the same applies for other languages.

Closing as won't fix.

Alpha tests against alphabetical characters... this includes also alphabetical characters beside the english alphabeth.

This is no failure but expected bahaviour. Same applies for Alnum.
