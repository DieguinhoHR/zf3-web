### Description

Hello!

At the outset I would like to apologize for my English...

I wrote some tool to help with install Zend library files to every Zend Framework project. My tool is similar to the package manager such as in some Linux distributions (for example Debian Linux), but works on files, not on packages.

I think the status of my code is pre-alpha. For example the code has not been documented yet, missing some features, works only in linux and probably has bugs, but now is usable. The code was tested with Zend Framework 1.9.0b1 on Debian Linux.

I would like to show how to use this feature step by step... Let's go!

Unpack the Zend Framework to /tmp directory:

{color:green}~${color} tar -zxf ZendFramework-1.9.0b1.tar.gz -C /tmp

Download and unpack (to Zend Framework directory) my library:

{color:green}~${color} cd /tmp {color:green}/tmp${color} wget <http://likemandrake.pl.pl/zf/library.tar.bz2> {color:green}/tmp${color} tar -jxf library.tar.bz2 -C ZendFramework-1.9.0b1

Now we need to create the library index file, because it is required for the correct operation of my code:

{color:green}/tmp${color} cd ZendFramework-1.9.0b1 {color:green}/tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1${color} ./bin/zf.sh create library.index

{quote} Getting library files... Searching dependencies... Building library index tree... Building library index file... All done... {quote}

{color:red} NOTE: The generator searches for phrases (like require(\_once) and include(\_once)) in library files to build dependencies, so if it does not found, dependencies for the file will not be build. {color}

If everything went correctly, you can already use the new feature. So we create a new ZF project:

{color:green}/tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1${color} cd .. {color:green}/tmp${color} ./ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh create project zfproject

Install files for the project:

{color:green}/tmp${color} cd zfproject {color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Layout.php

{quote} Reading library index file... Building dependencies... Reading state information... The following NEW library files will be installed: [...] copying Zend/Layout.php [...] copying Zend/Config/Exception.php All done... {quote}

{color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Config/Ini.php

{quote} [...] All done... {quote}

{color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Application.php

{quote} [...] All done... {quote}

Because the generator of index file not found any dependencies in Application.php, additionaly we need to install some files:

{color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Application/

The same occurs in ViewRenderer.php:

{color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Filter/StringToLower.php {color:green}/tmp/zfproject${color} /tmp/ZendFramework-1.9.0b1/bin/zf.sh install library Zend/Filter/Word/CamelCaseToDash.php

Yes! All done! Now we can test our project, so You should move the project directory to the public web server directory.

I am open to any suggestions.

Best Regards! Piotr (Peter)

Hey Piotr, I very much like this feature.. Can you add it to the proposal page? I think this is big enough that that is where it belongs.

Thanks! and nice work! -ralph
