### Description

This code sample in 22.2.3.1. of the programmer's reference documentation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $oldLimit = $memoryManager->getMemoryLimit();  // Get memory limit in bytes
    $memoryManager->getMemoryLimit($newLimit);     // Set memory limit in bytes


Should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $oldLimit = $memoryManager->getMemoryLimit();  // Get memory limit in bytes
    $memoryManager->setMemoryLimit($newLimit);     // Set memory limit in bytes


The typo is in the name of the second method call.
