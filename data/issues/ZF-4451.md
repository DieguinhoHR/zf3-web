ZF-4451: Zend\_Config with a strict mode
----------------------------------------

### Description

A strict mode in Zend\_Config to throw an exception when an item was not found in a configuration file. Perhaps, it is already proposed or already implemented but I see it like that :

class Zend\_Config[Ini|Xml]{ public function \_\_construct($filename, $section = null, $allowModifications = false, $strict = false){} }

class Zend\_Config{

private $\_strict;

public function \_\_construct(array $array, $allowModifications = false, $strict = false){ $this->\_strict = $strict; }

public function get($name, $default = null){ $result = $default; if (array\_key\_exists($name, $this->\_data)) { $result = $this->\_data[$name]; }else{ if($this->\_strict === true){ throw new Zend\_Config\_Exception("...."); } return $result; }

}

Best regards

Hi,

Can you provide a use-case for this idea please? I'm not sure what the benefit is.

Regards,

Rob...

I'm also trying to do this in a project. My method was to override the Zend\_Config class and create a getRequired($key) method.

If the key exists the value is returned if the key is not found then an exception is thrown. I think that I will have to find some other way as Zend\_Config doesn't allow it self to be sub classes very easily, since the constructor uses "new self()" when to add a subsection. So that means if I override the class, then any sub sections will still be Zend\_Config instances and not my subclass instance :(

My use case is that, in the payment system code, I want to require that certain elements like the following exist: \* payment system id \* payment system password \* default currency \* supported currencies

I could at an if statement before each value and then throw an exception, but I feel it's neater to just write

$config->getRequired('site\_name'); $config->payment->getRequired('supported\_currencies'); $config->payment->get('some\_optional\_value', 'default value');

Anyway those are my reasons, is there a better way to do this?

Hello,

What's happening if the item "payment" was not defined in your configuration file ? You will get an php error. We can convert a php error to an exception but this is not the subject.

I want to use required values in my models, my controllers, my views. I want to be sure what the administrator has defined this values in the configuration file.

For example, my ini config looks like :

view.doctype = XHTML1\_STRICT view.escape = htmlentities view.encoding = utf-8

My config file is loaded in the Zend\_Registry.

If somewhere in my application I call Zend\_Registry::get('config')->view->escape. Zend\_Config must to throw an exception if the item was not found. The request will be forwarded to the ErrorController because an "internal error" was not catched.

Best Regards,

This is not needed in Zend\_Config as you can trivially do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $siteName = $config->site_name;
    if(!$siteName) {
        thrown new Exception ('please set your config');
    }

Hello,

I can't understand why it is not the Zend\_Config's job to throw this exception. If I have defined many parameters in a configuration, sure it's required by my application. It is not my job to check each time if the parameter is defined.
