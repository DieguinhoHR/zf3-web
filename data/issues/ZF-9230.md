### Description

Hello,

we have a courious problem. One of our customers can enter a year value cause the validator says it's not integer. The customer uses a ukrain browser and displays our project in german. The validators says that 2008 is no integer.

We solved this problem temporarily by changing the xml file located in Zend\_Locale. We don't set especially a region or language for Zend\_Locale. We only set the language in Zend\_Translate.

What can we do to avoid those problem in future updates?

Please give some detailed information so we are able to reproduce your problem.

I've created a front controller plugin wich gets a language from a request param. After I got the language parameter I create a new instance of Zend\_Translate with the given language and scan my locale folder for gettext files in that language.

Than i created a new form with a new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text and added some validators. I use this code in my form to create the element:

$form = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm(array("legend" => "data")); $form->setDecorators($this->\_defaultSubFormDecorators); // this are some decorators defined in my own form class. $element = $form->createElement("text", "year\_of\_manufacture",array("class"=>"textElement")); $element->setDescription("Year of manufacture (bigger than 1900)"); $element->setAttrib('maxlength', 4); $element->setDecorators($this->\_defaultElementDecorators); // this are some decorators defined in my own form class. $element->setLabel("Baujahr"); $element->addValidator("Int"); $element->addValidator("GreaterThan", true, array(1900)); $element->addValidator("LessThan", true, array((int)date("Y")+1)); $element->setAllowEmpty(true); $form->addElement($element);

This works in a german browser but don't will work at ukrain browser. With ukrain browser i mean especially firefox in that language.

For a simple reproduction you just need to give the following infos:

- The value your user enters (a var\_dump from the value which is given into the Int validator... really var\_dump there so prevent that any auto-set filters are changing the value as filters are called before)
- The locale your user is working with (a var\_dump of setlocale(LC\_ALL, 0) )
- The locale the system is working with (a var\_dump of $locale within Zend\_Validate\_Int)

These simple informations should show the real problems.

Closing as "not reproducable" as there was no further response.

hi,

sorry for the late post.

the var\_dump of the value wich my user enters: string(4) "2008"

The var\_dump of the setlocale(LC\_ALL, 0): string(1) "C"

I can't debug $locale in in Zend\_Validate\_Int cause I'm not on that part of code. So I dumped $this->\_locale: string(2) "uk"

When setlocale returned "C" then the system does not provide a locale at all. This is very bad.

This means that in the case that your user does not provide a locale by browser the framework will fallback to english.

Regarding localized int... Note that "uk" defines that a Integer must have a " " grouping... "2 345" and not "2345".

In the latter case use the digits validator.
