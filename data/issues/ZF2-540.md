ZF2-540: Zend\\Http\\Client\\CookieJar is broken
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-09-10T15:06:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:14:35.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

1) Docs are out of date and incorrect: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.http.cookie.handling.html#zend-http-cookies-cookiejar)

2) No Zend\\Http\\Client\\CookieJar class currently exists. What had been "CookieJar" appears to have been renamed to "Cookies", but no changes have been made to the doc-blocks, and other portions of code may be incomplete/unrevised as well.

Note: A Disqus comment recently left on the doc page (mentioned above) says: "The class CookieJar is not available (2.0). A class (fully broken) Cookies is here but is not usable for now..."
