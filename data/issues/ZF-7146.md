### Description

Hi,

When generating pdfs through Zend\_Pdf, I felt the need of finding the width of the text to be drawn. Purpose is to be able to horizontally center text, align it to right and more.

It looks like other people felt that need too, here is a function found on internet that does it pretty well and it would be great to have it incorporated natively within Zend\_Pdf\_Page.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Return length of generated string in points
     *
     * @param string $string
     * @param Zend_Pdf_Resource_Font $font
     * @param int $font_size
     * @return double
     */
    public function getTextWidth($text, Zend_Pdf_Resource_Font $font, $font_size) 
    {
        $drawing_text = iconv('', 'UTF-16BE', $text);
        $characters    = array();
        for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($drawing_text); $i++) {
            $characters[] = (ord($drawing_text[$i++]) << 8) | ord ($drawing_text[$i]);
        }
        $glyphs        = $font->glyphNumbersForCharacters($characters);
        $widths        = $font->widthsForGlyphs($glyphs);
        $text_width   = (array_sum($widths) / $font->getUnitsPerEm()) * $font_size;
        return $text_width; 
    }

ps: maybe Zend\_Pdf\_Style::getLineWidth() is related to this topic, but I could not find any info on the doc nor in the code.
