ZF-9077: Only can have one Zend\_Session\_Namespace when using Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable - Overwrite problem

### Description

When using custom save handler Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable to write to a postgres DB, have found that namespaces overwrite the previous namespace. For example if you use Zend\_Auth and also store something else in a namespace, the Zend\_Auth namespace will be overwritten in the database which defeats the whole purpose of namespaces and causes major problems with the application. This also affects Flash messenger helper and other components that use the session to cache things.

We noticed when our app was swapped from our dev machine to our server cluster which is why we moved the sessions to the DB.

Only 1 namespace can be stored in the DB at any time.

Update... Looks like this is related to underlying serialization of data to DB so is not ZF.... Still looking into.

So bug report is incorrect, apologies.

Comment from reporter "so is not ZF" suggests it is not a ZF Issue.

Reopen if I'm misunderstanding
