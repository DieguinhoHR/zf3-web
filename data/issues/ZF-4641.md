### Description

When creating zend\_form with config and validating a date field, it throws exception when the file contained something like 'asdasda' -" No date part in 'asdasda' found.", BUT when the field contained '2008-sdgsdg , i got a correct error message in form - "'2008-sdgsdg' is not of the format YYYY-MM-DD".

I can't verify this.

You will get the first message when you are initiating the validator with a locale or format. And the second message when you don't give locale or format.
