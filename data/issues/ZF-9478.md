ZF-9478: assertQueryContentContains() fails with a numeric argument
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

$this->assertQueryContentContains('body', 42) will always fail. I know $match (42) is defined as 'string' in the documentation, but if an integer is passed the assertion fails silently.

Patch that inserts a cast to string in the \_matchContent() internal function (with unit tests).
