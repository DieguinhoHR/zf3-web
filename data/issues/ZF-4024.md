ZF-4024: Support for DELETE/PUT methods missing in Zend\_Rest\_Server
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hello!

It's a bit of internal incompatibility due fact that Zend\_Rest\_Client supports PUT/GET/DELETE/POST methods, but Zend\_Rest\_Server only GET/POST.

I can do HTTP rest request "DELETE /rest/object/123", but processing it via Zend\_Rest\_Server is impossible. Adding suppport for using HTTP method and making GET/POST "method" argument optional, would be quite an improvement.

Cheers!
