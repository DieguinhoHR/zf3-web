### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_Extension\_WebContent is incorrectly declared as a subclass of Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension, rather than the more specific Zend\_Gdata\_Extension. This should be corrected.

Created patch for this issue as [^ZF-2005\_v1.patch].

I'm debating as to whether this should be merged into the release-1.0 maintenance branch. Right now this bug doesn't break anything, though the patch has a very, very slight possibility of breaking somebody else's code. Somebody would need to be checking if a returned WebContent object is _direct_ descendant of Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension, and I can't really imagine any reason why somebody would do such a thing, but the possibility does exist.

As original poster mentions, there is a possibility of a BC break when correcting the name of parent class. Recommend this be fixed in Zend\_Gdata for ZF2.

-This issue was fixed in ZF2 repository when Gdata was converted to use namespaces.- Oops. That's not true. Working on a pull request now.
