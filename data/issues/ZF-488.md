ZF-488: [Coding Standard] Change keyExists() to isSet()
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The name keyExists() is an implementation detail of Zend\_Filter, and has no relevance to users of the class itself who are unfamiliar with the internals. A more descriptive name that PHP users would be more used to is isSet().

This method of Zend\_Filter\_Input has relevance to users because it can be used to determine whether a given datum is encapsulated by the Zend\_Filter\_Input instance, since $\_source is a protected member variable.

In a default instantiation of Zend\_Filter\_Input, the original source data array is set to null, and in this case, the user has no other way to get information on whether a given key exists in the object.

Further, I would argue against changing the name to isSet() because the PHP isset() function returns false if the value of an existing key happens to be null. The array\_key\_exists() function, on the other hand, returns true if the value of an existing key happens to be null. Naming a method isSet() that wraps the array\_key\_exists() function is misleading.

If I've missed something, please feel free to comment further and reopen the issue, but for now, I mark it as "won't fix."
