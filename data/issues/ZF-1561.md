ZF-1561: Wrong returned result in comparison to Luke toolbox

### Description

The problem is originaly reported by David in [ZF-General](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/32869):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My question is about the zend\_search\_lucene. I have searched the index with below:

"business controller" AND shanghai

There is about 300 hits. But when I search with LUKE Toolbox again with the same phrase string, there is about only 7 results, and that is correct for my case. And, there is only 14 documents in my index containing "business controller" phrase.

I need to know why the Luke toolbox's results is not the same with zend\_search\_lucence. Is there some configuration needed? I use the Zend 1.0.0 RC1, and my demo script is below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php';
    $query = "\"business controller\" AND Shanghai";
    //Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(new
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_TextNum_CaseInsensitive());
    //Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::setDefaultOperator(Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::B_AND);
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open('index');
    $hits = $index->find($query);
    echo "result:".count($hits);
    ?>

``` should give the same result for Zend\_Search\_Lucene and Apache (Java) Lucene.

But it didn't help: [[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/33168)]
