### Description

The execute() method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli takes a $params argument but does not use it.

Please pass the arguments in the execution of the statement, to match behavior of other adapters.

Implementation is complete in revision 3639. All Zend\_Db unit tests pass using the Mysqli adapter.
