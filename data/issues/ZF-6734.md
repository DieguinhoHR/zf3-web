### Description

Am looking for a way to take page content in my db and render it like if it were a view.  
 To be able to add PHP code to the page I create and be able to do exactly same if it was a view script. (use helper, filter etc..)

Closing this as it is a support request.

Please direct support requests to the fw-general mailing list or #zftalk on freenode irc.

There is no method to do this, besides using something like eval from inside a view, which is probably a pretty bad idea!
