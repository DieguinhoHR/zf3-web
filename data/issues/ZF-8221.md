ZF-8221: unregisterPlugin type problem
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-11-04T15:24:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:15.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The following problem occurs with Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Broker if you try to unregister a plugin.

If you try to unregister a plugin with the following code it doesn't work:

$frontController->unregisterPlugin(new Xodoa\_Controller\_Plugin\_Auth());

Xodoa\_Controller\_Plugin\_Auth extends Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract (so it's an instanceof)

To get it working there are two options. On line 98 in the Broker class it's possible to remove the true flag inside the array search method, that it doesn't compare the types. It seems like something goes wrong with the types inside array\_search.

$key = array\_search($plugin, $this->\_plugins);

Or the other option is to pass the parameter to the function unsregisterPlugin as a string:

$frontController->unregisterPlugin('Xodoa\_Controller\_Plugin\_Auth');

I expected that it's possible to also pass the object (like mentioned in the function documentation) to the function. The input parameter passes the first instanceof if clause, but then throws an exception because no key is found inside array\_search with exactly the same type (inside the array it seems to strings).

I used this for my testing inside a class that extends Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase.

Can help. Note line 11.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class Test 
    {
        public $value;
    }
    class Test2
    {
        
    }
    $test = new Test();
    //$test->value = 10;
    var_dump(array_search(new Test(), array(new Test2() , $test)));

You must pass the original plugin instance to unregisterPlugin(), not a new instance.

Ok, that makes sense. Because of the if clause I thought it only needs to be an instance.

The following code works (like you described):

$frontController = $this->getFrontController(); $plugin = $frontController->getPlugin('Xodoa\_Controller\_Plugin\_Auth'); $frontController->unregisterPlugin($plugin);

So it seems like I just expected that it works different from the documentation. Perhaps it would be good to add a note to the documentation about that.
