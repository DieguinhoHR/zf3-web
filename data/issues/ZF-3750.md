### Description

I tried to set param sources for \_GET only. bug Zend\_Controller\_Front::getParams() still returns \_POST variables

try following code

$\_POST = array(); $\_POST['test'] = 'ZF BUGGED!'; var\_dump($this->\_request->getParamSources()); $this->\_request->setParamSources(array('\_GET')); var\_dump($this->\_request->getParamSources()); $params = $this->\_request->getParams(); var\_dump($params);

Added patch. This patch is a slight update from the prior patch provided in terms of whitespace and a fix in the comment. Also added a test case for this issue.
