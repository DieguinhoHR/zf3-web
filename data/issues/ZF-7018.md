### Description

Many users ask for how to write a join request with Zend\_Db\_Table->select(). For now it is not possible to join foreign column to a table select statement unless you call setIntegrityCheck(false). Even so, the result is having one corrupted Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row instance with all column. I expected to have a non corrupted Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row with the foreign attribute being a reference to a second non corrupted Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.

Let have an exemple : We have to tables : Bugs(bug\_id, title, author\_id) and Authors(author\_id, name). I want to fetch all Bug table entries.

I can write :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bug = new DbTable_Bugs();
    $bugs = $bug->fetchAll();
    for each ($bugs as $bugRow)  {
        $bugRow->findParentRow('Author');
    }


But, this way I will do 1 + n queries to the database : 1 for the fetchAll query, n being every findParentRow queries. The solution would be something like :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bugs = $bug->fetchAllJoinAuthor();


and then findParentRow do not require any other queries, every rows needed whould have already been created and linked together.

Today I am nearly sure this feature does not exist yet (but I may be wrong). I think that Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row do not support foreign rows. It would be great if Zend\_Db could run the same as Propel does in the following exemple (my inspiration for this thread) : [[http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/…](http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/Users/Documentation/1.2/Relationships#FetchingRelatedObjects)]

I made up my mind and found a Component proposal on the wiki which is an answer to my problem : [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Db_Mapper+-+Benjamin+Eberlei)
