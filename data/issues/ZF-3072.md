### Description

This is a general improvement for whatever changes are required for the DB2 adapter on i5. We will coordinate with our i5 team and Tripp Lite on a solution. We should be able to test in a i5 test environment devoted to framework.

As mentioned in [ZF-905] it looks like it's good attitude to create many subadapters for odbc. Becouse i need adapter for odbc/as400 for pdo i created class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Odbc\_As400 - it strongly based on incubator version Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2 but it's simpler, just to fits my needs.

Db2 and db2/as400 have many differences so maybe it's reasonable to separate it into two classes?

greetings
