### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_Directory\_Filesystem::deleteFile() at line 215

There is a "throw $e" without catching an exception... think it wasnÂ´t removed before committing.

I'm on it. Some other improvements can be made as well.

Also ran into this issue. I know more clean up was needed, but wanted to report that I had success with applying the diff to my local. Using 1.5RC1

The patch attached is a fix and adds different improvements to the file.

Yes, it was non-removed debugging statement. Just fixed this.

I am not sure other things in offered patch should be applied. As I described in e-mail, ini\_restore() restores configuration option to 'configuration file value' instead of 'last effective value'. There are also some reasons to use current if(...) {...} else { if(...) ... } construction in the Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_Directory\_Filesystem constructor

The throw $e; is still in the framework (v1.5 GA).

Is this still an issue in 1.5.1? Was the fix ever merged back to the 1.5 branch? Please take appropriate action and update the issue.

Alex should have fixed

Not fixed in 1.5.2

merged from trunk to 1.5 branch at r9683. Should be ok for next 1.5 release
