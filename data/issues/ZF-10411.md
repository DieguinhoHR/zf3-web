### Description

Here is an example: We have form A and form B A inherited from B, B inherited from Zend\_Form. Form B defines some element and adds it to display group. Form A also defines an element and adds it to display group, defined in form B with Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup::addElement() method.

In this case element from form A will be rendered in form properly, but will not work as should - populate and getValue(s) doesn't work for it.

If to add element in form A to the form with Zend\_Form::addElement() (not just to display group) it will rendered twice - inside groups and outside of it and became to work.

Code example

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Form_Bform extends App_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->addElement(
                'text',
                'el1',
                array(
                    'label' => 'Title',
                    'required' => true,
                )
            );
    
    
            $this->addDisplayGroup(array('el1'), 'group1', array('legend'=>'legend 1'));
        }
    }
    


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Form_Aform extends Form_Bform
    {
        public function init()
        {
            parent::init();
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('el2', array(
                'label' => 'Customer type',
                )
            );
    
            //Uncomment the following line and element will be added twice
            //$this->addElement($element);
            $this->group1->addElement($element);
        }
    }

Element MUST be attached to a form or subform; attaching them ONLY to a DisplayGroup means they will never be rendered. In other words, you need to attach the element to the display group _after_ it is already attached to the form.

In your Form A example, you should be adding the element to the form using $this->addElement(), and then adding it by name to the display group:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Form_Aform extends Form_Bform
    {
        public function init()
        {
            parent::init();
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('el2', array(
                'label' => 'Customer type',
            ));
            $this->addElement($element);
    
            // OR:
            $this->addElement('text', 'el2', array(
                'label' => 'Customer type',
            ));
    
            // Add to group:
            $this->group1->addElement($this->el2);
        }
    }

Did you miss this?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            //Uncomment the following line and element will be added twice
            //$this->addElement($element);
            $this->group1->addElement($element);


Your code renders "el2" field two times - inside and outside of fieldset

I did indeed miss that, and I've verified the issue.

Oddly, addDisplayGroup() uses the exact same methodology for adding elements as simply calling addElement(); this is going to take some debugging to properly diagnose.

Fixed in r22930; will release with next minor release (1.11) as it involved adding new methods.
