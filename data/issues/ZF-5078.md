ZF-5078: Zend\_Amf does not properly serialize Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray instances

### Description

In attempting to switch from AMFPHP to Zend\_Amf, I ran across the following issue:

The AMF3 encoding doesn't seem to be correct for ByteArray instances. When returning a Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray instance, the serializer attempts to pass the instance to its writeString method, which attempts to treat it as a simple string, causing php to send the incorrect data as well as emit a notice as follows:

bq. Notice: Object of class Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray to string conversion

One way to avoid this and properly return the binary data to the server is to modify line 81 of Zend\\Amf\\Parse\\Amf3\\Serializer.php to read:

bq. $this->writeString($data instanceof Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray ? $data->getData() : $data);

Added support for Zend\_Amf\_Value\_ByteArray::getData into the serialization process.
