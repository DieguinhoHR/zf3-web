### Description

_Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_SimpleTest_ don't call _TestHelper_. The consequence is that it includes the class _Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_Simple_ from the directive _include\_path_ instead of using the working copy of this class. And, _Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_Simple_ has no static method _main()_.
