### Description

We are attempting to load a pdf and set the font, no text is being added. Following is a short example.

$pdf = Zend\_Pdf::load('example.pdf'); $page = $pdf->pages[0];

$fontPath = 'fonts/Avalon-Medium-webfont.ttf'; $page->setFont(Zend\_Pdf\_Font::fontWithPath($fontPath), 10);

A few items. 1. We've tried different pdf files with the same results. 2. We've tried different font's which work correctly (Georgia Italic.ttf) 3. When using the "Avalon-Medium-webfont.ttf" the pdf is rendered and looks correct but the error is received. 4. We can provide the font file if needed.

Can you please test this against the latest ZF release (1.11.11)? If the issue persists there, I will look into it.
