### Description

Just downloaded RC2, uploaded it fresh into its own directory, and created a very, very simple test script based on the tutorial (found here: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.calendar.html)) Here's the script (with username/password censored):

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata');
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin');
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_Calendar');
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Http_Client');
    
    ##  login
    $service = Zend_Gdata_Calendar::AUTH_SERVICE_NAME;
    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient('********@gmail.com', '********', $service);
    $service = new Zend_Gdata_Calendar($client);
    
    ##  create event
    $event= $service->newEventEntry();
    $event->title = $service->newTitle("Test Event");
    $event->where = array($service->newWhere("Sheboygan, Wisconsin"));
    $event->content = $service->newContent("This is my test event. This is only a test.");
    
    $startDate = "2008-01-20";
    $startTime = "14:00";
    $endDate = "2008-01-20";
    $endTime = "16:00";
    $tzOffset = "-06";
    
    $when = $service->newWhen();
    $when->startTime = "{$startDate}T{$startTime}:00.000{$tzOffset}:00";
    $when->endTime = "{$endDate}T{$endTime}:00.000{$tzOffset}:00";
    $event->when = array($when);
    
    // Upload the event to the calendar server
    $newEvent = $service->insertEvent($event);
    
    ?>

The script dies completely, displaying the following:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Gdata\_App\_HttpException' with message 'No more redirects allowed' in /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php:418 Stack trace: #0 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(415): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...', 0) #1 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(415): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...', 1) #2 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(415): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...', 2) #3 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(415): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...', 3) #4 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(415): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...', 4) #5 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php(588): Zend\_Gdata\_App->post('http://www.goog...') #6 /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/Calendar.php(152): Zend\_Gdata\_App->insertEn in /home/smhilt/public\_html/library/Zend/Gdata/App.php on line 418

Help! I essentially copied the example from the tutorial near-verbatim, but it doesn't seem to work! If need be, I can send you a phpinfo() upon request.

Thanks for the report and sorry for any inconvenience. This is a duplicate bug (ZF-1526, ZF-1527) fixed as part of svn revision 5202. These fixes will be in the RC3 release and hopefully a patch release to the GData-specific download shortly.

Here's more info on svn revision 5202:

Zend\_Gdata: [ZF-1525] Removed x-http-method-override header along with each call to resetParameters, to prevent it from being improperly included in requests which shouldn't have it [ZF-1526] Disabled the use of cookies in Zend\_Gdata\_App for the time being, until Zend\_Http\_Client supports setting raw cookie values which are not url encoded [ZF-1527] Fixed recursive calls to various HTTP methods (put,delete,etc) in Zend\_Gdata\_App when redirects are sent by the server. Previously, these recursive calls were being done to the same URL as the original request. This commit resolves that issue to instead perform the subsequent HTTP requests on the URL defined in the Location header of the response [ZF-1528] Added require\_once calls to lazy-load Zend\_Gdata\_App\_HttpException in the appropriate places before it's used

Note- additional online test cases were added for calendar as well-- to prevent this sort of problem making it into future releases.
