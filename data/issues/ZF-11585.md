### Description

See ZF-10725 - the fix which was added there for cleaning the action from non-alphanumeric characters is case sensitive, and therefore removes upper-case letters.

e.g., trying to access <http://mysite/Controller/Action> will break with

 
    <pre class="literal">
    script 'controller/ction.phtml' not found in path 


notice the missing A in the script's filename
