ZF-11334: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname does not identify IPv6 addresses properly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-04-30T05:17:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-08-25T19:49:14.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.11.6 (05/May/11)
 
 Reporter:  Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan)  Assignee:  Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan)  Tags: - Zend\_Validate
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-11188](/issues/browse/ZF-11188)
 
 Attachments: - [ZF-11334.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/13936/ZF-11334.patch)
 
### Description

Zend\_Validate\_Hostname Line 505-506 checks to see if the argument to isValid is an IP address, and if so checks to see if it is a valid IP:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (preg_match('/^[0-9.a-e:.]*$/i', $value) &&
                $this->_options['ip']->setTranslator($this->getTranslator())->isValid($value)) {


Notice that the preg express accepts only hex characters A through E, omitting F.

See: <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt> for IPv6 address examples used in tests

Reproducing test case plus fix. Applying patch had no visible consequence w.r.t execution of test suite.

Thomas, why did you reassign? Is this commit bad? It seems complete- do you need to do any more to this?

Re-assigning to Adam for bug-hunt credit, verified fix and will merge.

@Ralph: As I did not get reply on my mails I am asking you this way if I am allowed to add this to ZF2 or if you still want me not to touch components where I am the maintainer. A duplication was also not wanted, so please state how things should be done correct, or state if ZF1 issues should not be solved for ZF2

Added to ZF2 with GH-276 I hope this was correct as there was no response to my previous question
