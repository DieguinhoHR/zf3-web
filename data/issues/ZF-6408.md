### Description

Let Zend\_Filter\_File\_Rename accept filename only as target:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filter = Zend_Filter_File_Rename('filename.ext');


The full path should be gathered from the dirname(source).

I'm not sure if its a BC, because at the moments this would be handled as a relative path (like ./filename.text)
