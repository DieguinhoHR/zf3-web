### Description

When the message contains linefeeds and encoded as quoted-printable, Zend\_Mail qp-encodes them as =0A. I think it would be enough just putting \\r\\n there.

"If the data being encoded contains meaningful line breaks, they must be encoded as an ASCII CR LF sequence, not as their original byte values. Conversely if byte values 10 and 13 have meanings other than end of line then they must be encoded as =0A and =0D." <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable>

This is the way quoted printable should encode new lines.
