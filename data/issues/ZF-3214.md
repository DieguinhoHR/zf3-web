ZF-3214: Zend\_Session / Zend\_Session\_Namespace expire / timeout due to idling

### Description

Currently, there is no feature in Zend\_Session to force the session or namespaces to automatically expire due to idling (timeout?). It would be nice to have this feature at both - session and namespace levels:

Zend\_Session::setTimeout( $seconds ); $namespace->setTimeout( $seconds );

please add this request to [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_View+2.0)

in all honesty, thats probably about the time we'll get to implementing new feature in Zend\_Session
