ZF-5045: Improve Zend\_Text\_Table
----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-11-24T08:07:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:53.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

There are several improvements that can be made to Zend\_Text\_Table:

- Bug fixes
- Improved API
- Auto-sizing cells based on content

The last one especially requires significant changes to the render() methods.

These changes must be made in a BC way, so existing unit tests must pass any reworked component.

Well Matthew, I told you what to do to keep BC. Just go on :)

Most of the changes required are obvious, but actually making them work well and in a way that won't have to change yet again in the future takes time.

I would also like to see an improved configuration of the rendering process to not create a border around the whole table. I need an export in csv format and the api of Zend\_Text\_Table is quit nice, so i'd like to see a column with no padding and no outer most table border. This can easily be done by adding appropriate configurations to the table/row/column.
