### Description

The current picture in the quickstart guide describes a flow that is used in a statefull MVC application whereas ZF applications usually are stateless.

If wanted; you could use something I made some time ago: [http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/wp-content/â€¦](http://dolfschimmel.freeaqingme.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/modelviewcontrollerdiagramzf.svg) (no spamming intended)

What we show is a common MVC diagram that you'll find in just about an design patterns book. I think going into the difference between stateful and stateless in the quickstart is beyond its scope.

You're not the one having to answer all questions on IRC :D

I don't see why you want to use the diagram just because it's in just about any design patterns book when the image clearly does not fully shows the way ZF works. You don't have to explain why the image differs from the one in most design pattern books. Anyhow, call is yours (hence I leave this issue closed).

In the quick start, we do a _very_ brief overview of the MVC pattern and how it works -- but not the full details of how MVC on the web or more specifically MVC in ZF work. Those are left to the Zend\_Controller chapter.
