### Description

h4. What?

If you follow this step of the documentation: [Classloading performance](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html#performance.classloading.striprequires.sed). You have a problems with Zend\_Application!

h4. Why? Because on line 74 and 290 Zend\_Application use require\_once - and thats what we are stripping out.

h4. Solution? Change the documentation to something like this (untested - but should work):

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    % cd path/to/ZendFramework/library
    % find . -name '*.php' -not -wholename '*/Loader/Autoloader.php' \
      -not -wholename '*/Application.php' -print0 | \
      xargs -0 sed --regexp-extended --in-place 's/(require_once)/\/\/ \1/g'

Tested and works perfectly. I've updated the manual page in trunk and the 1.9 release branch, and it will publish with 1.9.2.
