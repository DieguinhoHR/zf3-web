ZF-672: Zend\_Registry needs its set() and has() methods back

### Description

Was it an oversight that Zend\_Registry lost its set() and has() methods when it was refactored to extend ArrayObject, despite still having a corresponding get() method? I don't know about everyone else, but I prefer to pass around a registry object explicitly rather than rely on the static Zend::register()/isRegistered() methods. I would really like these methods back.

$ini\_array = parse\_ini\_file('your\_stuff.ini'); // purely optional // ArrayObject::ARRAY\_AS\_PROPS enables accessing values using $registry->$indexName, in addition to $registry[$indexName]. // However, beware of name collisions, if you extend Zend\_Registry and add private variables. $registry = new Zend\_Registry($ini\_array, ArrayObject::ARRAY\_AS\_PROPS); Zend::initRegistry($registry);

See the comments: [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.arrayobject-construct.php)

Does this technique provide the desired features without subclassing Zend\_Registry?

Per Andi's comment on the list, it seems that this functionality is already present without passing this constant. I tried it before and it seemed to work. In any event, whether or not the parameter is required, that API works for me. Thanks, Gavin.

The documentation for SPL classes are weak, but show the optional $flag parameter defaulting to a value that prevents access to elements in an ArrayObject as properties:

\_\_construct ($array, $flags=0, $iterator\_class="ArrayIterator")

[http://php.net/~helly/php/…](http://www.php.net/~helly/php/ext/spl/classArrayObject.html)

I've added an example to the documentation for Zend\_Registry. See the Fisheye link for changeset information.
