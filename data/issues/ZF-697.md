ZF-697: Bad handling of the query part of an uri

### Description

I use Zend\_Http\_Client to request an uri like this: [http://example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action/…](http://www.example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderNR&columns=orderValue)

The problem is the module will request this one instead : [http://exemple.com/pan/aReport3Key.action/…](http://www.exemple.com//pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderValue)

It comes from the handling of additional GET parameters: it uses parse\_str function which will not understand the above query format.

The "quick and dirty" patch I am using to correct this issue.

Assigning to Shahar. Scheduling for 0.7 release.

Hi,

I was unable to reproduce this bug just as is. I do have unit tests that test for those kind of problems.

Can you attach here a small script that can be used to reproduce this problem? It is possible that I am doing something wrong because there are several ways to set GET parameters in Zend\_Http\_Client.

TIA

Hi,

Here is a small script to reproduce the problem.

The expected output is: original uri: [http://example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action/…](http://www.example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderNR&columns=orderValue) request made: GET /pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderNR&columns=orderValue HTTP/1.1 Host: <www.example.com> Connection: close User-agent: Zend\_Http\_Client

The actual output is: original uri: [http://example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action/…](http://www.example.com/pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderNR&columns=orderValue) request made: GET /pan/aReport3Key.action?columns=orderValue HTTP/1.1 Host: <www.example.com> Connection: close User-agent: Zend\_Http\_Client

As you can see the first "columns" parameter has been lost.

Hi,

Yes, I understand what happens, but I am not able to reproduce this. My testing shows no problem... ;) If you can, please send me a piece of _PHP source code_ that produces the problem - I need this because there is more than one way to set GET parameters in Zend\_Http\_Client.

Thanks, Shahar.

This is what I did ;) Just look the attachment named example.php.

I see now thanks.. The key issue that I didn't notice before (stupid me...) is that you use "column=" twice - that is you have two GET parameters with the same name.

I wonder how the server behaves in such cases? In PHP AFAIK the value of $\_GET['column'] would be 'orderValue' - which is just the same as it would be if you only specify the last parameter.

I guess you do not look at $\_GET['column'], but probably directly at the query string. In this case, we have a bug - and I will need to see if it is simple to fix. Can you explain what is the use case for such query string and how common you think it is? I would like to fix this, but if this is a very rare issue, I'm not sure I can spend the time on it now.

Thanks.

I agree, in php the value $\_GET['column'] would be 'orderValue' .

The issue is the request is not handled by php. BTW I do not know the engine which is handling the request: it is not operated by my company. I think it is java but I am not sure.

Anyway, as I said before, the issue comes from the use of parse\_str function which can not handle a non php compliant url.

If you take a look at the file client.patch you will see the patch I propose to correct this issue.

Hi.

Thanks for the patch - I've used some of it, and changed some because it didn't take into account encoding the parameters in $this->getParams. Anyway, the built-in http\_build\_query() function takes care of it quite well.

This should be fixed in r. 2600 - please update and let me know.

Thanks!
