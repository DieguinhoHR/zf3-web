ZF-7649: Using Zend\_Session with a Mysql backend, 2 successive writes can end up with a duplicate key error

### Description

Have encountered some errors relating to Zend\_Session trying to save a session (using Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable), where it tries to save with a session-id that already exists, (and in my application, results in a duplicate key insert error).

I believe this is due to the way that data is inserted into the table.

if ($this->update($data, $id)) { // do stuff and return true } else // return false

The issue occurs when a session is being saved, but NO data has been updated since the last update. Usually the "modified" time relating to the session will have incremented, however if the modified time is the same as it was previously, NO data may have changed in the session entry.  
 Mysql will therefore return "0" from mysql\_affected\_rows (and hence to the $this->update function above), and the code above will think that the row doesn't exist, when in fact it does.

This may occur for other DBMS, however I have only experienced it with Mysql.

Thanks.

Are you using the schema outlined [here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.session.savehandler.dbtable.html)?

Can you demonstrate a reproduction case?
