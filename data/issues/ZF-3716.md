### Description

'content-type' => string 'multipart/mixed; boundary="----=\_NextPart\_000\_006C\_01C8E533.F00DFB00"'

Its really anoying to have to filter out the boundary..

I have found a way to read out the boundary very easily: $boundary = Zend\_Mime\_Decode::SplitContentType($value['header']['content-type'], 'boundary');

It's even easier if you use Zend\_Mail\_Message: $message->getHeaderField('content-type', 'boundary'); // also works Zend\_Mail\_Part
