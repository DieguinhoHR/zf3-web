### Description

Newer comments: Would you please look at my mailing list (ZF General) posting: "Zend Form Decorators as a Table" Thanks.

New comments: This has been "closed" because you do not provide support for articles. Is this true even if you wrote the article? This article is described by many as the definitive documentation for form decorators. The apparent bug is that the setDecorators code from your article does not work as the article states. I get no table elements.

The following code:
-------------------

$choices = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm; foreach ($recs as $rec) { $a = $choices->createElement("text", $rec->value."\_a") ->setRequired(false) ->setValue($cd[$i]) ->setLabel($rec->label) ->setAttrib("class","") ; $a->setDecorators(array( 'ViewHelper', 'Errors', array(array('data' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'td','class' => 'element')), array('Label', array('tag' => 'td')), array(array('row' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'tr')), ));

 
        $b = $choices->createElement("text", $rec->value."_b")
        ->setRequired(false)
        ->setValue($cd[$i])
        ->setAttrib("class","")
    ;
    $b->setDecorators(array(
        'ViewHelper',
        'Errors',
        array(array('data' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'td','class' => 'element')),
        array('Label', array('tag' => 'td')),
        array(array('row' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'tr')),
    ));
    
    $choices->addElements(array($a,$b));
        $i++;


} $choices->setDecorators(array( 'FormElements', array('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'table')),

));
---

$choices gets added to my form using addSubForm.

When my form is rendered, I do not get the

 or tags. Here is a snippet of what is rendered. Plastic Steel . . .

Please post this to one of the mailing lists -- fw-general of fw-mvc. We do not provide support for posted articles.

I support the articles through the mailing lists, not the issue tracker. The issue is not with ZF code, but with example code in an article outside the ZF documentation.

Please take this to the mailing lists - I can help you there, or others may as well.
