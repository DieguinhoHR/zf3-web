### Description

Currently there is only one configuration file. It would be nice, if its possible to combine more.

An example: The prefered way is to set up the configuration under "configs/application.\*". So there could be others, something like "configs/navigation.\*", which would be the configuration for the navigation-resource-plugin. Or it will be the configuration for the module "navigation" and the config for the navigation-resource-plugin resist under "configs/resources/navigation.\*"

One other possibility is, that a module can carry its own configuration at "modules/name/configs/bla.\*". As mentioned in the project-structure-proposal [1] the modules mimic the default structure, so the "configs"-directory is included. This should be used somewhere... ;)

What about using an array for the 'config' option:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $application = new Zend_Application(
        APPLICATION_ENV, 
        array(
            'config' => array (
                APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/database.ini',
                APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
            )
        )
    );


and change the setOption method in Zend\_Application from

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!empty($options['config'])) {
                $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $this->_loadConfig($options['config']));
            }


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!empty($options['config'])) {
                if (is_array($options['config'])) {
                    foreach ($options['config'] as $tmp){
                        $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $this->_loadConfig($tmp));
                    }
                } else {
                    $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $this->_loadConfig($options['config']));
                }
            }

Attached is my proposed patch, if this is accepted it would be only to the trunk as another change that was made with ZF-6811.

This has been fixed and will be part of 1.10 as ZF-6811 was put into place before and was flaged for 1.10 since it introduces a BC break.
