### Description

On linux the element names passed to addElement() when creating elements by their name is inconsistent, don't know if you were aware or if that is deprecated or what not, basically if a user is not unit testing their forms, the logical thing to do is to assume all the names follow the same casing, since windows is case insensitive it could cause issues. Then again the PHP language itself is way worse in this regard....

Multiselect existed long before MultiCheck -- but the latter is a more appropriate name per our conventions. I agree, however, that it causes confusion. However, changing either one at this point is a BC break. It may be possible to gradually deprecate over several releases, though.

Yeah, renaming the class and putting a class under the old name that extends the new one. I might just do that locally... I'd be willing to contribute... ( would take like 2 seconds ;-) ). The logical thing to do would be deprecate the old name with long transition time for all the legacy code around it, I agree...

If we have two files with the _same_ name ("MultiSelect" and "Multiselect"), do we get problems with file systems which works case insensitive?
