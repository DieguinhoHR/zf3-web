ZF-6166: Zend\_Form\_Dojo\_Editor promotes insecurities and should have a default filter to strip malicious code

### Description

The Dojo Editor generates HTML markup and thus the standard striptags filter cannot be used with it. When echoing the output from it, it cannot be escaped for the same reason. This opens up a significant attack vector to modern ZF applications.

Therefore a new filter should be enabled by default on this element, one which allows only the HTML tags generated by the editor and strips out any non-standard tags.

I've implemented this using HTMLPurifier, but given the simple HTML markup generated this is probably overkill, and anyway I doubt you want to bring all of the HTMLPurifier codebase into ZF. See forum post [http://nabble.com/Zend\_Form\_Dojo-Editor-security-câ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Form_Dojo-Editor-security-concern)-(escaping-output)-td22782919.html#a22801743
