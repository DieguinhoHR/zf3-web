### Description

I think, the bug ZF-8193 is still here in 10.6.

Failed asserting that is an instance of class "Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap".

I make test project for this bug and with phpunit (3.4 and 3.5 fail) <http://github.com/abtris/ZF-8193>

There was 1 failure:

1) IndexControllerTest::testIndexAction Failed asserting that is an instance of class "Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap".

This not an issue

Assigning of the parameter _bootstrap_ is done through of the called Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap::run().

That happens in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase::dispatch() there need that the property Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase::bootstrap is instance of of _Zend\_Application_.

Simply make a change in setUp().

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = new Zend_Application(
                APPLICATION_ENV,
                APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
        );
        parent::setUp();
    }
