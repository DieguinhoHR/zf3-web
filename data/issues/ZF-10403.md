ZF-10403: Value missing in request params after POST in IE7 when using Zend\_Dojo\_Form without HtmlTag Decorator

### Description

Given is the following form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Dojo_Form();
    $form->setAction('/save')
         ->setMethod(Zend_Form::METHOD_POST);
    
    $fooElement = new Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_Textarea('foo');
    $fooElement->setValue('bar');
    $fooElement->setLabel('The following value will disappear after POST in IE 7 since the HtmlTag in Zend_Dojo_Form is missing.');
    $form->addElement($fooElement);
    
    $sendElement = new Zend_Dojo_Form_Element_SubmitButton('send');
    $form->addElement($sendElement);


The controller f.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function saveAction()
    {
        Zend_Debug::dump($this->getRequest()->getParams());exit;
    }


This looks like a regular Zend\_Dojo\_Form and works fine in all browsers.

But if you add:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setDecorators(array(
        'FormElements',
        'DijitForm'
    ));


which is the same form that now is simply missing the

<

dl class="zend\_dojo\_form"> HtmlTag, and post it with an IE7, then the value for the 'foo' element gets lost and will not appear in the request parameters.

This sure looks like a client related problem and about the way dojo handles the values of a form. Without the 'dl' tag latter don't seem to be included for submitting the form.

But maybe I'm wrong and there is more behind it. Anyway I posted it because maybe this should be documented or/and forwarded.

There are suggestions how this problem is created: [http://groups.google.com/group/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.internetexplorer.general/browse_frm/thread/dd3055a977a505b1/b1de550f7feb1a30?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q)=

 
    The problem can be simply reproduced by doing a POST with an XMLHttpRequest to a server which is using a small keep-alive timeout, say 10s. If the POST request is made right before the keep-alive timeout expires and there is a slight network latency the web server will reset the connection and force IE to resend the request. This time IE will "forget" to send the body but will still send the old Content-Length header, resulting in the server waiting for the body to arrive until a read timeout occurs. 
    
    The "right before" and "slight network latency" make it sound like this bug is hard to reproduce but experiences have shown that this bug is not hard at all to run in to while using a modern web application through e.g. a mobile connection. 
    
    The only solution seems to be to turn off keep-alive on the server (or maybe set it to more than 60s). 


Again: This only happens when you POST an input field value IE7 using Zend\_(Dojo\_)Form without a HtmlTag after the

<

form> tag.

Can anybody confirm that this is an IE7-keep-alive problem?
