### Description

I use one translate adapter for all my forms, but cannot seem to translate the captcha error messages.

For example, it's really easy to be able to define

Zend\_Validate\_NotEmpty::IS\_EMPTY => 'Some localized errormessage'

but this seems impossible with the current CAPTCHA adapter.

I'm not sure I understand the problem... Captcha adapters do have message templates, e.g. recaptcha:

 
    protected $_messageTemplates = array(
        self::MISSING_VALUE => 'Missing captcha fields',
        self::ERR_CAPTCHA   => 'Failed to validate captcha',
        self::BAD_CAPTCHA   => 'Captcha value is wrong: %value%',
    );


vs. NotEmpty

 
    protected $_messageTemplates = array(
        self::IS_EMPTY => "Value is required and can't be empty",
        self::INVALID  => "Invalid type given, value should be float, string, array, boolean or integer",
    );


So what exactly is missing for you there?
