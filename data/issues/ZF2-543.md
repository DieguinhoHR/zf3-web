### Description

I read from Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\AdapterPluginManager.php, "'xcache' => 'Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\XCache',". But I don't find any class named Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\XCache.

And when I try factory with :

$cache = Zend\\Cache\\StorageFactory::factory(array( 'adapter' => 'xcache', 'plugins' => array( 'exception\_handler' => array('throw\_exceptions' => false), ), ));

The result (predictable, but if nobody says, no reason to fix) is :

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\XCache' not found in D:\\Personnel\\phpSofts\\ZendFramework-2.0.0\\library\\Zend\\ServiceManager\\AbstractPluginManager.php

The xcache adapter wasn't finished yet. It will be implemented in 2.1 and the link within AbstractPluginManager needs to be removed until it's available.

I'll fix it immediately.

Removed linked but not implemented storage adapters from AdapterPluginManager

Created a new one to implement the missing adapters: ZF2-552
