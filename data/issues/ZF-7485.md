### Description

I am making an app which needs to have a Serbian translation. Serbian has both cyrillic and latin scripts, and they are present in Zend/Locale/Data/ as sr\_Cyrl\_RS.xml and sr\_Latn\_RS.xml. The sr\_RS locale points to the cyrillic version.

When I do a $locale = new Zend\_Locale('sr\_RS'), I would like to be able to specify the script as well.

For example: $locale = new Zend\_Locale('sr\_RS@Latin');

Without it I'm limited to the Cyrilic version (months, etc), which is unacceptable.

Thank you for your time.

This is very critical issue, since we are limited only on Cyrilic script, and 90% of serbian websites are implemented using latin script. Also, Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList('territory') gives only cyrilic territories, no way to get latin.

Can this be fixed or at least find the way around it???

This issue is not marked with any priorities. So the original author noted it but did not declare that it's critical.

Regarding fixing: As long as an issue is opened it will be fixed. Please note that this is open source. This means that all people here are spending their spare time and are not payed for the work. This means on the other hand that issues can take a longer time to be fixed when other things are more important like issues marked as important versus issues marked as not important.
