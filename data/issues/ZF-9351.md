ZF-9351: Zend\_Form does not throw Exception on equal names in same (Sub)Form level
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The current implementation in Zend\_Form assigns every new Element, SubForm and DisplayGroup with the given name as key to the member array \_order.

Thus equal named SubItems overwrite the previous one silently.

At least we could throw an Exception until this gets handled different.
