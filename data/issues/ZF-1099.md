ZF-1099: Zend\_View\_Exception does not include sufficient information
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Since the design of the ZF controller/view system can result in userland code catching the exception in a place where the relevant view object might not be easily identified/accessed, why not follow the ZF coding standard recommendations regarding providing relevant data with exceptions?

There are several places where exceptions are thrown, but the following ought to be sufficient to demonstrate the idea. Although more detailed information could be stored in the exception object, storing the view is probably sufficient to make this information readily accessible to code catching the exception.

-------- Original Message -------- Subject: Zend\_View\_Exception - Why does it not include the view as a member element? Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2007 16:46:46 -0700 From: Gavin Vess [gavin@zend.com](mailto:gavin@zend.com) To: fw-devteam@zend.com [fw-devteam@zend.com](mailto:fw-devteam@zend.com)

Why not do the following in Zend\_View?

 
     throw new Zend_View_Exception('script <whatever> not found in 


path', $this);

I realize this change isn't exactly a specialized exception (i.e. supplying specific pieces of data to the exception), but the change is extremely simple and makes information available to whoever catches the exception. This change would require very few code changes.

Cheers, Gavin

This makes a ton of sense -- the various other MVC components are doing this already, and with the View layer being so far down the stack, catching exceptions and tracing the reason can definitely be made easier.

Assigning to Gavin.

See the FishEye link for information about the committed changes.

The changes are not "perfect" and could include more fine-grained access and details, but the changes are extremely simple, easy to check, address most of the underlying issue, and improve the existing class.
