### Description

Using the sample code provided in the manual, it's not possible to authenticate with Google - using <https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id> - it is however possible to authenticate with e.g. myopenid without issue.

Error message returned: "Discovery failed"

Using latest 1.9 branch of ZF.
