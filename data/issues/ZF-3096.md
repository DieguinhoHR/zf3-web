### Description

In Zend\_Service\_Flickr is used "iconv\_set\_encoding()"(lines: 65, 66, 67) , but this feature gives problems with the version 5.2.5 PHP if used in the configuration "php\_admin\_value" sel Apache server.

My solution is to replace lines(65-67) it:

ini\_set('iconv.output\_encoding',"UTF-8"); ini\_set('iconv.input\_encoding',"UTF-8"); ini\_set('iconv.internal\_encoding',"UTF-8");

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

Using ini\_set for 3 very important variables within Zend\_Service\_Flickr is highly dangerous behaviour. It should be removed and be replaced with explicit changing when needed.

Additionally iconv\_ is not defined on all platforms.

It isn't clear to me why this ini values are set in the first place, since iconv() doesn't seem to be used anywhere in the component. Alex, could you please investigate and close this issue?
