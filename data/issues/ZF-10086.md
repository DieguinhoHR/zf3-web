### Description

When I'm trying to create a new Row object, and this process fails on save() â€” I have no ability to see the SQL query string that failed.

Would be very nice to add this parameter to the Exception class.

I don't agree, this is not the intention of exception messages. If you want to retrieve the original query you should catch the exception, and use the db profiler in order to get the actual query/queries.
