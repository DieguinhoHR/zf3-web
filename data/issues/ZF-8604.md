### Description

Tried using the cacheManager resource as per the documentation

 
    <pre class="highlight"> resources.cacheManager.database.frontend.name = Core
    resources.cacheManager.database.frontend.options.lifetime = 7200
    resources.cacheManager.database.frontend.options.automatic_serialization = true
    resources.cacheManager.database.backend.name = File
    resources.cacheManager.database.backend.options.cache_dir = "/temp"

This might be related to the naming of the plugin. Application resource doesn't seem to play nice with camel cased plugins (note Frontcontroller resource name is not camel cased) so fix could potentially be renaming Cachemanager and using resources.cachemanager in the application.ini

The file shoud be renamed as 'Cachemanager.php'
