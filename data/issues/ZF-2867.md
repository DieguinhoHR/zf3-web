### Description

Affects Version: 1.5.0 RC2

The file "Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php" contains in the function "renderScript()" a hardcoded Zend\_Log Streamwriter-Path (someone forgot to remove this after debugging i think ;-) )

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function renderScript($script, $name = null)
        {
            if (null === $name) {
                $name = $this->getResponseSegment();
            }
    
    require_once 'Zend/Log.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Log/Writer/Stream.php';
    $log = new Zend_Log(new Zend_Log_Writer_Stream('/tmp/zf.log'));
    $log->info(sprintf('Preparing to render script "%s"', $script));
    
            $this->getResponse()->appendBody(
                $this->view->render($script),
                $name
            );
    
            $this->setNoRender();
        } 

should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function renderScript($script, $name = null)
        {
            if (null === $name) {
                $name = $this->getResponseSegment();
            }
    
            $this->getResponse()->appendBody(
                $this->view->render($script),
                $name
            );
    
            $this->setNoRender();
        }

Bookkeeping. Closing and ssigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
