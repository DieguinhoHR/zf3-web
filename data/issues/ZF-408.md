### Description

I use ToroiseSVN 1.4 (using subversion 1.4). If I would make a checkout on "http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk" I get the log-window. But for 15 minutes it doing nothing. Then I get this error: REPORT request failedon '/svn/framework/!svn/vcc/default' REPORT of '/svn/framework/!svn/vcc/default': 400 Bad Request (<http://framework.zend.com>)

Marc, are you still having trouble checking out from Subversion?

I can not not checkout from subversion 1.4 (using by TortoiseSVN 1.4) but with the Subclipse plugin for eclipse i can checkout it. This version is Subclipse 1.0.3 (SVN interface is JavaHL 1.3.2 Windows binaries)

The fact that other people are having success with TortoiseSVN 1.4 (including me), should indicate that the there is no problem with the Framework svn repository.

The error you are seeing probably indicates that you have an issue with a proxy server between your client computer and the internet.

See this web page for details about resolving issues with subversion and proxy servers: <http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#proxy>

I don't have a proxy server but i have found the problem in an other programm.

- _Kaspersky Anti-Virus v.6.0_ The "Web\_Anti-Virus" setting "HTTP-Datenstrom untersuchen" (in english "HTTP data stream examine") will block the REPORT request. If I deactiate this option it goes. This problem is only on subversion 1.4 on a HTTP repository

Thank you for your help

Thanks Marc, it sounds like you have a workaround, to disable your antivirus temporarily while you are accessing Subversion using TortoiseSVN.

Many modern anti-virus programs have software firewall features, to defeat trojan horse malware that try to make outbound network connections to propagate themselves to other computers. Security software may block any outbound network connection from unauthorized applications on a PC.

There may be a configuration in your Kaspersky software to allow you to authorize TortoiseSVN to make network connections. You can follow up with your software documentation or technical support to find out how to do that.

Closing issue. It is not an issue on our end, it is an issue with the user's PC configuration.
