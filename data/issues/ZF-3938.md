### Description

It would be useful to be able to set and/or retrieve the encoding used to interpret the underlying document in Zend\_Dom\_Query. Some possible use cases:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Assign encoding at construction
    $queryObject = new Zend_Dom_Query($string, 'utf-8');
    
    // Assign encoding through mutator
    $queryObject->setEncoding('utf-8');
    
    // Assign encoding in setDocument*() methods
    $queryObject->setDocument($string, 'utf-8');
    $queryObject->setDocumentHtml($string, 'utf-8');
    // etc.
    
    // Retrieve current encoding
    echo $queryObject->getEncoding(); // utf-8

I have problems with encoding, after querying some html with Zend\_Dom\_Query Serbian chars (š.č,ć...) are messed, any idea how to fix this?

I have problems with decode too. When Zend\_Dom\_Query recive utf text with russian chars, He return not readable text. Any combinations with iconv did't have result. Check please your plugin.
