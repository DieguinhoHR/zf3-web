ZF-7371: Zend\_CodeGenerator doesn't overwrite existing method that is being redefined
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-07-23T16:06:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-09-19T13:36:05.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When reflecting from a existing source using Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_File::fromReflect\* you are not able to overwrite the existing method.

Instead it appends the "new" method to the end of the file, and thereby breaking the code.

In the code it is suppose to throw an exception (which doesn't work see ZF-7361 ).

I would prefer being able to overwrite this method $class->setMethod($method, true /\* overwrite default false\*/ ), or provide a method to remove the existing method.

ZF-7361 is now fixed, and you can change a method by calling:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $class->getMethod('Foo')->setFinal(true)->setSourceDirty(true);
