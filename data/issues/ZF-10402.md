ZF-10402: URL formation seems to break Zend\_Form\_Element\_Hash
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This may be my implementation, but if I create a basic form with a hash element, I cannot get the form to validate if the URL has a trailing slash.

profile/login works, but profile/login/ produces 'tokens do not match' error.

Stumbled across this when using url() action helper to create the form action URL as it (correctly) inserts a trailing slash. Zend\_Navigation controls do not seem to, though I may have overlooked something there.

To Replicate
------------

application\\forms\\Test.php

class Application\_Form\_Test extends Zend\_Form { public function init()

{ $this->setMethod('post'); $this->addElement('text', 'email', array( 'label' => 'Your Email Address:', 'description' => 'Example description for the field', 'attribs' => array('accesskey' => 'E'), 'required' => true, 'AutoInsertNotEmptyValidator' => false, 'filters' => array('StringTrim'), 'decorators' => Custom\_Subclass\_Decorators::$element, ));

$this->addElement('hash', 'csrf', array( 'salt' => 'Test', 'ignore' => true, ));

$this->addElement('submit', 'submit', array( 'required' => false, 'label' => 'Submit', )); } }

application\\controllers\\IndexController.php

_snip_

 
    public function testAction()
    {
        $form = new Application_Form_Test();
        $this->view->form = $form;
    
       $request = $this->getRequest();
        if($request->isPost()) {
            if ($form->isValid($request->getPost())) {
    
            }
        }
    
    }


_snip_

application\\views\\scripts\\index\\test.phtml

<?php echo $this->form;

/index/test works without any issues while /index/test/ cannot be submitted because of unmatched token.

Something odd seems to be going on with the session in the latter case, as is the hash is regenerated and stored in the session after rendering the form, but only where that trailing slash is present.

Attempted to make it a little more readable

Found the cause.

Mistakenly had the follwing line in my layout file.

Being a relative link, it was failing to be found causing a 404, but on pages with forms was triggering both the original request and the failed file to be rewritten to index.php, causing a dual page load which was overwriting my session between browser page loads.

Might be wrong on the why, but commenting out that line fixes it.

This issue can therefore be closed, but it might be worth testing to find a definitive cause and perhaps apply a workaround in the .htaccess file if applicable.
