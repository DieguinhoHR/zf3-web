### Description

Adding validation of International Bank Account Number (IBAN) would be a nice feature, since it is being used at least in the whole of Europe.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN>

PEAR holds a Validate\_Finance module which implements it.

The question is whether this falls under 80 in the 80/20 rule.

In my view, it falls in the same category as Barcode EAN/UPC. That is why I proposed an implementation.

It falls under the 80 because the IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is always used when you have to transfer money from one country to another country.

It's for international money transactions. And therefor it will of course also be implemented.

Component added with r13454 to incubator. It awaits code review and will probably be added to core with the next release.
