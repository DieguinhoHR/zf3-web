### Description

The attached patch adds checks that the container and object name passed to Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Files meet the requirements outlined at: [http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/â€¦](http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/API_Operations_for_Storage_Services-d1e942.html)

It supersedes the patch I submitted for ZF-12309. It should really convert to UTF-8 as well, but I haven't quite figured out how you guys handle that.
