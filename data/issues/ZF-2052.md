ZF-2052: base url not detected when it has urlencoded characters
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When the base url has a space in it (or whatever urlencoded character I guess) the Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http object does not detect it properly.

A simple urldecode() inside Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setRequestUri() will fix that

Patched in trunk and release-1.0 branch.

Changing this behaviour actually breaks many applications, particularly those that pull from getPathInfo(). I am reverting this change.

If you need this functionality, subclass the request object as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Request_Http extends Zend_Controller_Request_Http
    {
        public function setRequestUri($requestUri = null)
        {
            parent::setRequestUri($requestUri);
            $this->_requestUri = urldecode($this->_requestUri);
            return $this;
        }
    }

Will not fix, as it breaks other behaviours.

I'm suggesting another fix that won't change Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::$\_requestUri.

_Context:_ I access my development Apache server via the following URL (a VirtualHost): <http://devprojects.myself.local> My multiple Zend-powered application are accessible from there. For example: [http://devprojects.myself.local/myGreatZfApp/…](http://devprojects.myself.local/myGreatZfApp/public/) But, for some, there are spaces in the name of the folder that contains the application. Hence they appears the URL as "%20" (eg. [<http://devprojects.myself.local/another%20Zf> App/public/]).

_Problem:_ My problem is that, on theses projects, baseUrl is not correctly set: it stays empty (an empty string). By analysing the code of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::setBaseUrl() I found out that base URL is somehow firstly correctly detected (either via $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] or $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF']), stored in local variable $baseUrl but gets compared to Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::\_requestUri:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Does the baseUrl have anything in common with the request_uri?
    $requestUri = $this->getRequestUri();
    
    if (0 === strpos($requestUri, $baseUrl)) {
        // full $baseUrl matches
        $this->_baseUrl = $baseUrl;
        return $this;
    }
    
    if (0 === strpos($requestUri, dirname($baseUrl))) {
        // directory portion of $baseUrl matches
        $this->_baseUrl = rtrim(dirname($baseUrl), '/');
        return $this;
    }
    
    $truncatedRequestUri = $requestUri;
    if (($pos = strpos($requestUri, '?')) !== false) {
        $truncatedRequestUri = substr($requestUri, 0, $pos);
    }
    
    $basename = basename($baseUrl);
    if (empty($basename) || !strpos($truncatedRequestUri, $basename)) {
        // no match whatsoever; set it blank
        $this->_baseUrl = '';
        return $this;
    }
    
    // If using mod_rewrite or ISAPI_Rewrite strip the script filename
    // out of baseUrl. $pos !== 0 makes sure it is not matching a value
    // from PATH_INFO or QUERY_STRING
    if ((strlen($requestUri) >= strlen($baseUrl))
        && ((false !== ($pos = strpos($requestUri, $baseUrl))) && ($pos !== 0)))
    {
        $baseUrl = substr($requestUri, 0, $pos + strlen($baseUrl));
    }


My opinion is the code doesn't make the difference between a file path on the server and an URL (that have it's own set of constraints): the two may be similar then have some small differences.

_Steps to reproduce:_ - Create a blank new Zend application - Make it accessible via an URL that contains one or more spaces (eg. [<http://127.0.0.1/my> projects rep/The Application/]) - Print the base URL via Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getBaseUrl() or Zend\_View\_Helper\_BaseUrl::getBaseUrl() - Notice it's empty (should be "/my projects rep/The Application/")

_Fix proposal:_ The simple following fix seems to do the trick (making the Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::\_requestUri going through urldecode()):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Does the baseUrl have anything in common with the request_uri?
    $requestUri = urldecode($this->getRequestUri());


But, as I said, file paths and URLs shouldn't be considered as equals: thus I suggest to make $baseUrl (which is actually constructed from file paths) go through urlencode() instead:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Convert the paths found into an URL (handling specials characters such as spaces)
    $baseUrl = urlencode($baseUrl);
    
    // Does the baseUrl have anything in common with the request_uri?
    $requestUri = $this->getRequestUri();
    
    [...]

Please ignore my second proposal (applying urlencode() on $baseUrl) as (urlencode() hasn't the proper effect on base URL (spaces are changed to "+").

Additionally, I've noticed that with my first fix proposal (applying urldecode() to the request URI) when accessing to [[http://127.0.0.1/my%20projects%20rep/…](http://127.0.0.1/my%20projects%20rep/The%20Application/public/index.php)] (note the tailing "_index.php_"), base URL takes the _wrong_ value "/my%20projects%20rep/The%20Application/public/index.php" (because, in that case, $baseUrl directly fully matches the request URI).
