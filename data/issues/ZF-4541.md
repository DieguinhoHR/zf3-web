ZF-4541: formatModuleName missing from Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Related to ZF-2853, formatModuleName is not included in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface.

I noticed the issue when ViewRenderer called the method on a custom dispatcher I created, which is based on Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract (which obviously implements the interface)

formatModuleName is implemented in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard, not in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Abstract.

Affects (at least) standard/branch/release-1.6

Patched attached (that bug is related to the interface)
