### Description

With this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cb = new Zend_Form_Element_Checkbox('agree');
    $cb->setLabel('Agree')->setRequired(true);
    $subform->addElement($cb);
    // + some magic with decorators (should not influence the issue)


will the checkbox not validate on form submit with message "non-empty value required" even when checked. $\_POST dump:

 
    <pre class="highlight">array(2) {
      ["therms"] => array(1) {
        ["agree"] => string(1) "1"
      }
      ["next"] => string(27) "Finish"
    }


$form->getValues() dump:

 
    <pre class="highlight">array(1) {
      ["therms"] => array(1) {
        ["agree"] => string(1) "1"
      }
    }

I tried to dump the value send to the validator (via the %value% parameter). When the checkbox is checked: in default it sends 0 to the validator. If I set 'foo' using setUncheckedValue('foo')->setCheckedValue('bar') the validator gets newly set value, but again, the unchecked-one 'foo'. You can see the issue reproducted [here](http://info.mpalan.cz/html/objednavka/podminky) (please don't break my bandwidth limit, thanks ;) )

I recreated this issue also with Zend\_Form\_Element\_Radio... I have two radio buttons [1,0] with captions [Active, Draft] and when I try to select Draft (= value:0) I got the same error message as above !

Does anyone experienced this bug, or it's just me?

We modified the logic in NotEmpty to allow a string "0" value, which corrects this issue. Please test against 1.5.3, 1.6.0RC1, or current trunk, and re-open if this is still an issue.

The bug still exists using version 1.8.1. I also tried some bugfixes from other issues and other sites, they, however, don't work as well.

I can confirm that bug is still there in latest trunk. I have re-created this bug here: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9709> but it was closed with 'Not an issue' resolution

Thanks
