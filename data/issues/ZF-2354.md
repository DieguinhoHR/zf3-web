### Description

YouTube\_Extension\_MediaGroup was not processing media:content entries as YouTube\_Extension\_MediaContent objects, but rather taking the logic of the parent (Media\_Extension\_MediaGroup), which processed them as Media\_Extension\_MediaContent. Because of this, the yt:format attribute was not being processed.
