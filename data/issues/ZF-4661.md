### Description

The following method has been part of my Zend\_Path proposal which has been rejected with the additional comment that the Zend-Dev team would like to add this method to Zend\_Loader.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Returns the current system's temp-path.
     * 
     * This method tries to determine the temp-path using several
     * attemps according to a snippet by minghong at gmail dot com
     * @link <a href="http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.sys-get-temp-dir.php#71332">http://de3.php.net/manual/en/…</a>
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public static function getTempDirectory()
    {
        if (function_exists('sys_get_temp_dir')) return sys_get_temp_dir();
    
        if (!empty($_ENV['TMP'])) return realpath($_ENV['TMP']);
        else if (!empty($_ENV['TMPDIR'])) return realpath($_ENV['TMPDIR']);
        else if (!empty($_ENV['TEMP'])) return realpath($_ENV['TEMP']);
        else
        {
            $temp_file=tempnam(sha1(uniqid(rand(), true)), '');
            if ($temp_file)
            {
                $temp_dir=realpath(dirname($temp_file));
                unlink($temp_file);
                return $temp_dir;
            }
            else return null;
       }
    }

Note: Such a function is already implemented in Zend\_File\_Transfer but protected as we need to know the temp-path while working with file up-/downloads.

I can see the utility of such a function, but I'm not sure why this function would be located in Zend\_Loader. Ralph, do you know? If not, maybe Alex or Matthew can give us some historical perspective. Please evaluate and categorize as needed.

Since ZF doesnt support 5.2.1 (or lower) and since this function in php:

[http://us2.php.net/manual/en/…](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.sys-get-temp-dir.php)

has been in place since that version, it makes sense to use that function instead of a userland function such as this.

Feel free to reopen if I am missing something. -ralph
