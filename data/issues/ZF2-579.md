### Description

I couldn't change the layout ( layout/layout ) to something different from the default through module.config.php

Currently we have:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'not_found_template' => 'error/404',


I suggest adding:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'not_found_layout' => 'whatever',
