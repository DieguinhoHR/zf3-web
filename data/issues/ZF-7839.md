### Description

I would like to see the "standard" Zend Framework bootstrapping method to be supported in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase. It is confusing and not obvious on how to reuse your Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap when using the ControllerTestCase.

There are 2 ways that this can be done.

------ First Method ------

Document with code examples on how to use Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_\* in the Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase manual. However one issue is that it feels a bit weird as you have to overwrite $this->\_frontController manually yourself.

--- One Current Example ---

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = array($this, 'appBootstrap');
        parent::setUp();
    }
    
    public function appBootstrap()
    {
        $this->frontController
             ->registerPlugin(new Bugapp_Plugin_Initialize('development'));
    }


--- Using Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap Example ---

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = array($this, 'appBootstrap');
        parent::setUp();
    }
    
    public function appBootstrap()
    {   
        // Create application, bootstrap, but don't RUN!
        $application = new Zend_Application(
            APPLICATION_ENV,
            APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
        );
        $bootstrap = $application->getBootstrap();
        $bootstrap->bootstrap(); //note run() is not called!
        //front controller now bootstrapped using whatever method you used (config, resource plugin...etc)
        //Having $this->frontController and $this->_frontController may be hard to explain
        $this->_frontController = $bootstrap->getResource('frontController');
    }


As you can see this is quite simple, but as I noted in the comment it may be confusing to explain that you have to overwrite $this->\_frontController not $this->frontController.

------ Second Method ------

Actually supporting Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap in ControllerTestCase.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->bootstrap = new Zend_Application(
            APPLICATION_ENV,
            APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
        );
        parent::setUp();
    }


if $this->bootstrap is set to an instance of Zend\_Application then have the ControllerTestCase automatically call $bootstrap->bootstrap() for you. Future calls to $this->getFrontController() will retrieve the frontController from the bootstrap instead.

This is a simplified example obviously and I may have missed some details, but it seems obvious for some kind of support of the "standard" bootstrapping method. Bootstrapping can be very lengthy/complex and since the main goal is re-usability why would we want to have a completely different bootstrap method (or duplicated) for controller testing. I think this improvement will "sync" Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase with the encouraged bootstrap method. This also puts to great use the separate production , development, testing ini settings document in the Zend\_Application quick start. It becomes even more important with all the plugins with preDispatch details...etc. I think you get the point :).

Thoughts, suggestions, hate messages are welcomed :)

Clarifying some confusing writing.

Added additional support for importance of re-usability.

I think the second example makes the most sense. It's simple and concise for the end-user, and relatively easy to support. I'll take a stab at it today.

The second use case is now possible:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class FooControllerTest extends Zend_Test_PHPUnit_ControllerTestCase
    {
        public function setUp()
        {
            $this->bootstrap = new Zend_Application(
                'testing',
                APPLICATION_PATH . '/configs/application.ini'
            );
            parent::setUp();
        }
    }


This will be available in 1.9.5, and is currently in trunk and the 1.9 release branch.
