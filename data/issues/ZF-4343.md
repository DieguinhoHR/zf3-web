ZF-4343: Setting request object to front controller in MVC app doesn't work
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Consider the following code:

 
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
    $request->setModuleName('system')
            ->setControllerName('install')
            ->setActionName('index');
    $front->setRequest($request);
    $front->dispatch();


I would expect, from reading the documentation, that the system/install/index module/controller/action would be run on dispatch. It doesn't.

If I replace the request instantiation with

 
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http("http://myserver.com/system/install/index");


The correct page is displayed

I shouldn't need to know about my base url to set a request object programmatically or do I?

Anyway I think this is a bug because I cannot use the set...Name() functionality as I believe was intended and documented.

Actually ,the request object you pass in _is_ used.

The issue here is that the _router_ overwrites all parameters with the defaults found during routing. The default route defines the index controller and index action as defaults and sets them if nothing is matched -- overwriting the values set prior to dispatch.

The only ways to get around this at this time are to: \* Remove the default route from the router \* Override the default route such that it does not contain default values \* Define a null router that does nothing
