### Description

If the first load method in PluginBroker :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locator  = $this->getServiceLocator();
            // Pulling by alias
            if ($locator) {
                try {
                    $instance = $locator->get($plugin);
                } catch (ServiceManagerException $e) {
                    // not returning an instance is okay; there are other ways to 
                    // retrieve the plugin later
                    $instance = false;
                }
    
                if ($instance) {
                    if ($this->getRegisterPluginsOnLoad()) {
                        $this->register($pluginName, $instance);
                    }
                    return $instance;
                }
            }


With these lines i can write in my controller :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function indexAction()
        {
            $manager = $this->plugin('ViewManager'));
        }


I think is not the PluginBroker job, so to fix that i propose to verify alias configuration with :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $class = $this->getClassLoader()->load($plugin);
    if (empty($class) && !class_exists($plugin)) {
                throw new Exception\RuntimeException('Unable to locate class associated with "' . $pluginName . '"');
            }


just before the loading by alias and keep the use of servicemanager to load alias and complete class name.

You can try to use ServiceManager instead of ServiceManager like this PR <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1550>

Closed because Zend\\Loader\\PluginBroker has been removed in favor of Zend\\ServiceManager
