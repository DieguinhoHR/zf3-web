What version of PHP are you using? I ran tests a few minutes ago, and they ran fine on PHP 5.2.1.

Martel is doing some work on the Module router and rewrite router, and these will be fixed within the next few hours.

5.2.1 as well.

Everything should be working smoothly again.

Thanks for paying attention for such things, Sebastian :)
