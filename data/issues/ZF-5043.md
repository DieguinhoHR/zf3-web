ZF-5043: problem supporting array form on ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Element\_DatePicker

### Description

Zend\_JQuery\_Form\_Element\_DatePicker seems to have problem with array ID's.

As Zend\_Form\_Subform are by default treated as array, any element inside the subform will be an element of the array subform

 
    <pre class="highlight">


This cause the datepicker to not work in the above element.

This can be solved disabling the form as array

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Form::setIsArray(false);


Wich suppress the array style:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


Making the datepicker to work correctly.

But i think this must be supported by the form element, as someone would like to keep using the array notation in the forms, to separate subforms.

Hello,

i need more input on this. I have a subform example <http://www.beberlei.de/jquery/demo/formdemo.php> which doesnt automatically create form arrays.

Can you help me to reproduce it?

I know why it fails when going with subarrays though. You should post me the javascript errors that are generated and i can confirm that jQuery maybe does not like $("#subform1[element1]")

The array notation is eliminated when definig the id in the form, but if you create the form element as is, within a subform, it will set the id automatically to subform[elementid]

Relaying a comment for someone who can't comment... same error goes for the slider as well.

I am very sorry, i cannot get it to work such that this problem does appear.

Could you please provide a simple test-case that produces array notation using ZendX\_JQuery\_Form? That would be very nice. I try some more...

I know have a testcase of the following sort:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * @group ZF-5043
         */
        public function testFormWithoutIdButSubformsProducesArrayNotationWhichWontWork()
        {
            $view = new Zend_View();
            $form = new ZendX_JQuery_Form();
    
            $datePicker = new ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_DatePicker("dp1");
    
            $subform = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
            $subform->addElement($datePicker);
    
            $form->addSubForm($subform, "sf1");
            $form->setIsArray(true);
    
            var_dump($form->render($view));
            var_dump($view->jQuery()->__toString());
        }


it produces the following output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


` `     
    
    "
    string(353) "

It does produce the sf1-dp1 ID and talks to it correctly in the jQuery helper output. It works in Firefox for me. For me this issue is closed unless a clear testcase is provided that makes this bug reproducable.

(I came across this issue when trying to solve the problem of using jQueryUI Date Picker with an array field name, so I thought I would add my solution for posterity)

You can fix this problem and still keep the array syntax for the field name (ie: for a date+time picker combination element) by overriding the ID attribute:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Method 1: Direct Creation
    $datePicker = new ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_DatePicker("MyCompoundElement[date]");
    $datePicker->setAttrib('id', "MyCompoundElement-DatePicker");
    echo $datePicker->render();
    
    // Method 2: Using ZendX_JQuery_View_Helper_DatePicker
    // (from within a view script)
    echo $this->datePicker("MyCompoundElement[date]", 0, array(), array('id'=>"MyCompoundElement-DatePicker"))


This will create the following HTML output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     
    


and (assuming the jQuery helper is set up properly) the following javascript in the document header:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#MyCompoundElement-DatePicker").datepicker({});
    });


Hope this helps,
