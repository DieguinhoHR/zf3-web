ZF-1384: addMonths() calculates incorrect date
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-05-15T01:04:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:10.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.0 RC1 (28/May/07)

### Description

Consider the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-01-01');
    $date->addMonth(12);
    print $date->getIso();


This code returns an incorrect date:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    2008-12-01T00:00:00-06:00


If I understand things correctly, this error is caused by the fact that when Zend\_Date\_DateObject::mktime() is called Zend\_Date::\_calculate() is told to return a timestamp in GMT. However, this timestamp is then passed on to Zend\_Date\_DateObject:::getDateParts() which in this case calls getdate() which returns time info in the local time zone.

Not that this is necessarily the correct way to fix this problem, but if I force $gmt to false in Zend\_Date\_DateObject::mktime(), the above code does return the correct date:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    2009-01-01T00:00:00-06:00
