ZF-11049: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row::delete() impossible after save()
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-02-08T02:11:20.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-02-08T02:12:47.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

A deleted row cannot be used anymore to insert new data:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Restaurants extends Zend_Db_Table {
    protected $_name = 'restaurants';
    }
    
    $restaurants = new Restaurants;
    $row = $restaurants->createRow();
    echo $row->save(), PHP_EOL;
    echo $row->delete(), PHP_EOL;
    echo $row->save(), PHP_EOL;


Result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2043800
    1
    exception 'Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception' with message 'Cannot refresh row as parent is missing'


This is because $\_cleanData is not reset after a delete. It may be convenient to reset it, because it would allow the use of a deleted row as a new row freshly created with createRow().
