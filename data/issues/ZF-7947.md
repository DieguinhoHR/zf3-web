ZF-7947: Zend\_Queue\_Stomp\_Client\_Connection::canRead() method produces warning

### Description

I'm using Zend\_Queue from CLI. When I kill my script during call to stream\_select (it is waiting for some time if there is no data in socket), I get following warning:

PHP Warning: stream\_select(): unable to select [4]: Interrupted system call (max\_fd=5) in /usr/local/PEAR/Zend/Queue/Stomp/Client/Connection.php on line 184

I don't think that good object-oriented code should produce warnings.

Hi Anton,

Could you provide sample code and describe the process how to re-produce the issue?

Denis
