### Description

Hello,

While i am working with various projects based on ZF i noticed on latest snapshots downloaded from SVN there are errors on same line:

Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in D:\_Work\\test\\library\\Zend\\Translate\\Adapter\\Csv.php on line 79

With older versions of Zend Framework (1.5.2 stable) i don't have those problems

Please use the latest release when adding issues. I am unable to reproduce this behaviour because line 79 is a if clause with isset... isset does not throw a notice !!
