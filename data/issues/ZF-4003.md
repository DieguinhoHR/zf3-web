ZF-4003: uncessesary final method declaration
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-19T19:21:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-13T14:10:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.0 (17/Nov/08)

### Description

The Zend\_Controller\_Action class contains four methods declared with final modifier:

1 - final protected function \_getParam($paramName, $default = null) 2 - final protected function \_setParam($paramName, $value) 3 - final protected function \_hasParam($paramName) 4 - final protected function \_getAllParams()

The question is why. those functions are just wrapper functions for a protected variable and they use getRequest() which is not final. What about if i wana extend the functionality of them and make a general Action call for all my application for example load a default controller parameters from a config file without modify the request?

Please remove the boring final :)

Thanks.

Fixed in trunk.

Without unit test since i don't come up with a non-obvious way of testing this (without leading to fatal error if its final again).
