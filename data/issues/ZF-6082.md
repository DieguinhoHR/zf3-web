### Description

I basically only set a module directory on my FrontController pointing to ./application/modules . Inside that directory is the following file agenda/controllers/FrontendController.php . Now when I point my browser to /agenda/Frontend/ I get this notice: ```

I suppose it's not supposed to throw notices. :D

Tested with r14417

Attached patch (didn't run unittests though).

Got a unit test for that patch? :-)

Nope. I've never done any unittesting so at this moment I'm not the right person to write such a test I'm afraid.
