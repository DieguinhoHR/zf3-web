### Description

There are encoding character (éà ...) problem in the generation of the Xml client request.

Client sample code :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
          require_once 'Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php';
    
          $client = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client('<a href="http://server/tests/zend/zendServer.php">http://server/tests/zend/zendServer.php</a>');
        
          echo $client->call('EchoService', array('tést'));


Server sample code :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            require_once 'Zend/XmlRpc/Server.php';
        require_once 'Zend/XmlRpc/Server/Cache.php';
        
        /**
         *
         * @param string $message
         * @return string
         */
        function EchoService($message) {
            return $message;
        }
        
        $server = new Zend_XmlRpc_Server();
    
        $server->addFunction('EchoService');
        
        echo $server->handle();


Result :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    té³´

@Porati Sebastien: Please check the encoding of all your files, webserver and your browser. Your code works fine. I checked it and I got "tést" as result. So it isn´t a bug in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client.

Those commenting on the issue are absolutely correct. The encoding of the data you work with, the PHP code file itself, as well as the headers all need to be the same. I've struggled with the issue before, and have always been able to get my XML-RPC server and clients transmitting encoded characters correctly.

When PHP 6 comes out, this will be much easier. In the meantime, Zend Framework cannot try and guess all these variables correctly for every environment; for instance, we simply cannot control the encoding in which you write your own PHP scripts.
