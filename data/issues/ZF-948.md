### Description

getRegionList returns all territories which are contained within CLDR.

It was told that a function which returns only countries and only continents would be nice. Also a function which returns what countries are included in an continent should be included.

Proposed new functions:

getCountryList() - only countries, no territories getTerritoryList() - some are not continents... f.e. oceania or middle east getTerritoryDetail() - for which countrys are included in an territory

 

 

### Comments

Included with SVN 3606.

Now countries and territories (containing several countries) can be returned with an own function.
