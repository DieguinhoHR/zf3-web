### Description

Action helper's init() method is called in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::\_\_construct().

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __construct(Zend_Controller_Action $actionController)
        {
            $this->_actionController = $actionController;
    
            foreach (self::$_helpers as $helper) {
                $helper->init();
            }
        }
    


Because a helper broker object is created in Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_\_construct in order for the init() method to be called the helpers would have to be added before the action object is created.

This results in helper's init() method not being called at all in most cases.

Proposed solution:

in file HelperBroker.php

- delete the foreach loop from constructor
- put $helper->init(); in method getHelper (line 183) after $helper->setActionController($this->\_actionController);

This will cause the init() method to be called every time a helper is being fetched in action.

I think this is consistent with the manual: {quote} init(), triggered by the helper broker at instantiation, can be used to trigger initialization in the helper; this can be useful for resetting state when multiple controllers use the same helper in chained actions. {quote}

It is also important when init() method will be called the helpers \_\_actionController will be set.

init() was designed for use with persistent helpers, and/or helpers that may need to reset state if used in multiple controllers. It is called in two situations:

- If the helper has been loaded globally (i.e., from the bootstrap), init() will be called everytime a controller class is instantiated by the dispatcher.
- The first time a helper is instantiated via getHelper().

Basically, init() is called when needed. If you want it to run at instantiation, perform a call to it in your constructor.
