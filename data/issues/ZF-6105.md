ZF-6105: Customising of dispatcher in routeStartup()

### Description

In my ZF application I use an Initializer plugin to perform the application bootstrapping. I believe that this is a common (if not recommended?) way of setting up ones environment.

Therefore, I believe first opportunity to start performing the initialisation is during the routeStartup() hook.

I need to give the front controller a custom dispatcher, and I want to do as soon in the dispatch process as possible - i.e. routeStartup()

Now that should work fine. Except that in Zend\_Controller\_Front (line 883), a $dispatcher variable is created with a reference to $this->\_dispatcher. Shortly after (line 896), the routeStartup() hook gets called. In my case, this now changes the front controller's dispatcher.

And that should be fine, but unfortunately we still have this $dispatcher variable which we created on line 883, and $dispatcher still contains a reference to the old dispatcher.

This becomes a problem on line 934, when we actually do $dispatcher->dispatch(), because we dispatch the request using the old dispatcher, and not the new dispatcher which is now referenced by $this->\_dispatcher.

Therefore, my proposed solution is to change line 934 to read: $this->getDispatcher()->dispatch($this->\_request, $this->\_response);

But there may be more to it than that, I don't know :)

This is based on ZF 1.7.7

I think this problem may be similar to ZF-4106 (<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4106>)
