### Description

In the reference guide of Zend\_Application in the [examples section](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.examples.html), I found the following snippet:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Bootstrap extends Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap
    {
        protected function _initRequest(array $options = array())
        {
            ...
        }
    }


I was trying to find the utility of $options, since it is not passed by the calls to bootstrap() and bootstrap(). Also, in the snippet, the $options array isn't used.

Reading Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract, the \_init method isn't called with additional arguments. This can confuse some people, specially if trying the overloaded way.

As a hint, look the following methods of Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract:

- \_\_call
- bootstrap
- \_bootstrap
- \_executeResource
