ZF-3700: Can't add routes without front controller instance
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-21T05:57:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-07-21T12:20:43.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

This seems to be broken by changeset 10189,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = new Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite();
    $router->addConfig(new Zend_Config_Ini('../config/routes.ini'));


Result is an exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Exception' with message 'Front controller class has not been loaded'. thrown in Zend/Controller/Router/Abstract.php getFrontController() method.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (class_exists('Zend_Controller_Front', false)) {
                require_once 'Zend/Controller/Front.php';
                $this->_frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
                return $this->_frontController;
    }


This never gets executed unless you explicitly include front controller class. So it fails when autoloader is used and controller instance is not yet created.

This bug is not directly related to the changeset 10189 but was there before. It was only triggered by this changeset. Going to fix and merge it into 1.6 branch.
