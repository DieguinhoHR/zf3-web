### Description

Hi

The credit card providers have some more restrictions on they're card numbers.

e.g.: - VISA: \* All Numbers starts with: 4 \* The length is 16

- MASTERCARD:


  - All numbers starts with: 5[1-5]
  - The length is 16
- AMERICANEXPRESS:


  - All numbers starts with: 3[4|7]
  - The length is 15
- JBC


  - The length is 15 or 16

I think this can be implement like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ccNumValidator = new Zend_Validate_Ccnum();
    $ccNumValidator->useProviderRestriction(Zend_Validate_Ccnum::VISA);
    $ccVumValidator->isValid($myCcNum);
    
    // or
    $ccNumValidator = new Zend_Validate_Ccnum();
    $ccNumValidator->addProviderRestriction("visa", "4[0-9]{15}"); // RegExp of VISA validator
    $ccNumValidator->useProviderRestriction("visa");
    $ccVumValidator->isValid($myCcNum);

No, this does not work. A correct validation for credit cards also include a checksum and probably a online-check.

The checksum calculation is already implemented in Zend\_Validate\_Ccnum but this doesn't check restrictions for a specific provider.

You are right, the best check is the online check, but this doesn't work with every provider and the service request needn't be called if the check fails before.

CCnum does only a Luhn validation. Not sure if all credit cards are using this algorithm. Also the length is nit correct with 13 to 16 chars.

In my eyes, CCNum is NO valid credit card check. It only checks if the provided number COULD BE A CREDIT CARD, but it does no deeper check.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\_card\_number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card_number)

You see that if a checksum validation than it is the luhn algorithm but some card types doesn't have a validation algorithm :( ???

Therefor it could be better to implement it like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myNumber = "1234567";
    
    $luhn = new Zend_Validate_Luhn();
    $luhn->isValid($mNumber); // does the luhn algorighm match this number
    
    Zend_Validate_Ccnum::addCardType("visa", array(
        'algorithm' => 'luhn', // or new Zend_Validate_Luhn ???
        'length' => array(13, 16), // valid lengths or if string only one length is valid
        'prefix' => '4', // prefix pattern
    ));
    $ccnum = new Zend_Validate_Ccnum();
    $ccnum->cardTypes(array("visa", Zend_Validate_Ccnum::MASTERCARD));
    $ccnum->isValid($myNumber); // matches only if one of the given card types match

or configure this only with validators than you can check every card types by different validators:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class myVisaValidator implements Zend_Validate_Interface {
        // ...
    }
    Zend_Validate_Ccnum::addCardType("visa", new myVisaValidator());

Proposal waiting for recommendation by the devteam since 19.06.2009

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2009-09-28T11:04:43.000+0000

Closing as "Needs proposal".

Note that the related proposal has already been accepted for incubator development.
