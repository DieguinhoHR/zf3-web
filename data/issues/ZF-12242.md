ZF-12242: Disabling translator in Zend\_Form\_Select only for options
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It often occurs that the options for the "Select" element come from the database filled in there through a web interface. This means they should not be automatically translated. Disabling translator for this element solves the problem but in turns it requires you to manually translate all other element's properties like label, description and all validator messages. It would be nice to have a metod like setDisableTranslatorForOptions(boolean) which would turn translation mechanism for the options only.

Hi Przemysław, can you help use with a patch and some unit tests? There are more than 200 open issues for Zend\_Form and the component maintainer Christian no longer works for the Zend Framework project. Before you start, you must send the [CLA](http://framework.zend.com/cla) to Zend.

Thanks and greetings Frank
