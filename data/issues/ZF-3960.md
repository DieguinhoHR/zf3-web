### Description

When running this code from command line (on Windows)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once "Zend/Loader.php";
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    $log = new Zend_Log();
    $writerFirebug = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug();
    $log->addWriter($writerFirebug);
    $log->log('hi', 2);


It dies with: {quote}Catchable fatal error: Argument 1 passed to Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract::setResponse() must be an instance of Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract, null given, called in \\library\\Zend\\Wildfire\\Channel\\HttpHeaders.php on line 248 and defined in \\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Plugin\\Abstract.php on line 75{quote}

To make it completely clear:

I have general Log class (writers - Db, Firebug) used in webapp. And I need to run some cron import scripts which should report errors in the Log.

What should likely happen is that if the response object is null, the channel writer should not attempt to instantiate the plugin.

Scheduling for RC3; Christoph, please see my previous comment for a solution.

I can fix the error described, however the intent is to throw an exception if the response object is not initialized to make it clear to the developer that the logged data will not make it into the response likely due to improper initialization. This is the intended behavior for WEB apps.

We have several options to solve this issue:

1) Make it the developer's responsibility to disable the Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp component when running in CLI mode

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Wildfire_Plugin_FirePhp::getInstance()->setEnabled(false);


2) Automatically disable the Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp component when running in CLI mode

3) Removing the exception altogether to not provide any feedback if the Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp component is not properly initialized.

My preference would be option 2.

Any comments?

(2) sounds good to me as well. However, how do you plan on determining that you're running from the CLI?

I was hoping there was a ZF component for that, but I guess not.

How about

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    (php_sapi_name()=='cli')

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug is now disabled by default when run from the command line.

If you want to enable it you must use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug();
    $writer->setEnabled(true);
