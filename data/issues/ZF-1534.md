### Description

It seems Zend\_Filter doesn't allow (white)spaces in a string. This is rather annoying when you're performing database queries where the spaces are removed from the string and then put into the database.

Is there a way around this, like adding an option to the filter? If not, please allow (white)spaces to the Alnum and Alpha filtering in Zend\_Filter.

This is related to the existing issue ZF-1453, which requests validators that permit whitespace. It should be part of the same implementation to provide both filters and validators that permit whitespace.
