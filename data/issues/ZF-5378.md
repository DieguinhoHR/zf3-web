### Description

When outputing to Firebug, it would be nice to have a quick overview of logged queries, either via a percentage column between Time and Event columns (or maybe something visual like \*\*\* for a rather slow query and \* for a quickie) and/or the slowest query somehow highlighted. It would make it easier for the developer to see where's the problem, IMHO.
