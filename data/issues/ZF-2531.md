### Description

A filter stripping all repeated spaces would be useful. Html for example ignores all repeated spaces an just the first is shown.

Such a filter could look like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Filter/Interface.php';
    
    class Zend_Filter_StripRepeatedSpaces implements Zend_Filter_Interface
    {
    
        public function filter($value)
        {
    
            return preg_replace('/ +/', ' ', $value);
    
        }
    
    }

I think a filter called "Zend\_Filter\_StripSpaces" will be much more senseful. In the constructor you can set whether all spaces or just the repeated ones will be removed.

I will make a proposal in the next days.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Closing as needs-proposal.

Currently under recommendation. See [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Filter_StripSpaces+-+Thomas+Weidner) for details
