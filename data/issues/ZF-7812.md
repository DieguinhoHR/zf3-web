### Description

In r17874 (August 28) the NOT\_YYYY\_MM\_DD class constant for Zend\_Validate\_Date was removed in trunk.

[http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Standard_Library/?cs=17874)

Not sure if it was intentional or not, but it triggers fatal errors across two of my applications in testing since I am hooking into it from Zend\_Form. If intentional, I'll switch over. This does not affect the release-1.9 branch, only trunk.
