### Description

After Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Class was instanciated once, it does not recognize if an option is changed with setOption(). Say I set the cached cached\_entity to $instance and set it to $another\_instance later on, the behaviour won't change. The problem with it is, that the values of \_specificOptions is pulled into local values in the constructor and never read again.
