Well, I don't have the ability to easily replicate this, but after digging into my code, it looks like it could possibly happen on Zend as well, since Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain's match function could make redundant calls on getPathInfo() and if \_pathInfo is ever '0' that empty() check will fail.

But it would take me hours to properly reproduce this in Zend (simply not setup to test this locally)

Closing -- user indicates it was a local error, not a framework error.
