I expect the following:

The default Time within your locale is something like that: "HH:mm:ss a"

which means that your standard time is only allowed from 0-11 and you have an meridiem which seperates morning and afternoon. So you have 01:00:00 pm and 01:00:00 am... This means that a time like "22:00:00" is not possible in your locale, you would have to set a proper meridiem.

Please provide the following data:

Your set locale in the script Your set timezone in the script If you use BCMath

The used version of ZF... before committing an bug please check always against the latest SVN version.

If I add the locale to the object, then it works well.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    date_default_timezone_set('Asia/Taipei');
    $lo = new Zend_Locale("zh_tw");
    $a = Zend_Date::now($lo);
    
    echo $a->getIso($lo)."\n";
    
    $a->setTime("22:13:14");
    
    echo $a->getIso($lo)."\n";


But would it be possible determine the time assigned automatically, rather than the time was decreased 12 hours.

ZF 1.0.1, Rev.5906 BCMath enabled.

How Zend\_Date works on localized data depends on the given locale... If you do not provide a locale to Zend\_Date it tries to automatically detect the locale from your browser or environment.

In the docu it's declared that always a locale should be set... as sometimes the locale can not be detected because the server does not provide one. In such environments localized inputs for I18N classes do not work.

As your script works when you give "zh\_tw" per hand it means also that your default script is another one.

Please provide your "default" locale for futher inventigation.

    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array("format_type" => "php"));
    $lo = new Zend_Locale ( "Asia/Taipei" ) ;
    $currentTime = new Zend_Date("2007-9-1", null, $lo) ;
    $currentTime->setTime("14:12:10", "H:i:s",$lo);
    $endTime = clone $currentTime ;
    $endTime = $endTime->addMonth ( 3 ) ;
    
    echo "Current time:" . $currentTime->getIso ($lo) . "\n" ;
    echo "End time:" . $endTime->getIso ($lo) . "\n" ;


Exports: Current time:2007-09-01T14:12:10+00:00 End time:2007-12-01T14:12:10+00:00

If add date\_default\_timezone\_set

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    date_default_timezone_set ( 'Asia/Taipei' ) ;


Then it exports: Current time:2007-09-01T14:12:10+08:00 End time:2007-12-01T14:12:10+08:00

Is this correct ? I assigned the Zend\_Locale, but it still stay the GMT timezone.

Please provide your default locale for further investigation See PHP's setlocale() an how to do this.

Related to your second issue...

If you have 01.Sept.2007 14:12:10 and add 3 months you will receive the 01.Dec.2007 14:12:10... I see no failure on this.

And your output from ISO says "+08:00" which means that it is no longer in GMT but in GMT + 8 hours... also here I see no failure.

For questions on how Zend\_Date works feel free to ask within our mailinglists fw-i18n@zend.com or fw-general@zend.com.

PS: Timezones and Locales are two things... they have nothing to do with each other. Locales are used to localize and normalize input and to receive locale informations. Timezones just define the offset to calculate for a date / time. A user with the locale "en\_US" could also have a timezone of "GMT+2" if he wishes.

As we are not getting feedback we are closing this ticket. From the respone it seems that there is only a misunderstanding and not a failure.

Feel free to reopen this ticket if you think its not fixed and you are able to provide the needed data for reproduction for us.
