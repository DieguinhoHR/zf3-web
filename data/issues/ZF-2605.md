### Description

As quoted from the list (Feb 03, 2008; 03:18am): " Currently, formButton renders an tag, not a tag; we could potentially change this to render a tag instead. If you'd like that, please place an issue in the tracker.

Regarding the content itself, currently the tag suffers from a similar issue, however: content is automatically escaped using htmlentities. I'm considering adding a flag to allow formLabel (and potentially formButton) _not_ to escape the value, which would allow for richer tags.

Matthew, it would be very useful if formButton would render a true tag. Furthermore, I would like a flag added to and probably to give the option of escaping the value or not.
