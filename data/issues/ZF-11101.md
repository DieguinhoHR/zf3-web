I have checked this against the Google Calendar API reference for the Event kind ([http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/…](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/elements.html#gdEventKind)), and there is no hidden attribute. The closest thing is "visibility", which is already implemented in Zend\_Gdata\_Kind\_EventEntry and is already referenced in the same attribute list on the documentation page for this component.

Attached is a patch which removes mention of "Hidden" attribute on events from the documentation for Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar (specifically, this section: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.calendar.html#zend.gdata.calendar.creating_events.single))

Hello, Adam, I will push [solve] button instead of You. And I have marged to 1.11 branch for next mini release.
