ZF-8262: Zend\_Ldap\_Collection fails to check constraints, fails to return first result with current without seeking

### Description

Zend\_Ldap\_Collection has a protected var \_currentNumber that defaults to -1. Calling current() on a fresh Zend\_Ldap\_Collection returned by a search will result in Zend\_Ldap\_Collection searching for index -1 in an array that should be indexed with positive numbers. This then falls through to Zend\_Ldap\_Collection\_Default where a similar error is made, all in all resulting in the inability to call current() without seeking first. There is a function getFirst(), however I would expect current() to return either NULL if no result exists (as in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract) or the first result if I do not seek.

Fixed in trunk (r18921)

Removed dependency on calling Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::rewind() before using Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::current() and/or Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::key(). Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::rewind() will be called internally if iteration has not been started yet.

Added Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::getInnerIterator() to return the underlying Zend\_Ldap\_Collection\_Iterator\_Default.

Added Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::dn() to accompany Zend\_Ldap\_Collection::key(). The latter returns the numerical index of the current result item within the result set, the former returns its DN.
