### Description

I've been having a problem authenticating using OpenID with the MyOpenID site.

Just as the error in the summary suggests, I have traced the problem to the Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer->verify function (line 316). The problem stems from the 'openid\_op\_endpoint' parameter not matching the stored discovered server.

During initial server discovery, MyOpenID is sending back '<http://www.myopenid.com/server>' and this is stored in the consumer storage file. After authentication with MyOpenID, in the 'openid\_op\_endpoint' parameter, it is sending back '<https://www.myopenid.com/server>'. Note that the only difference is the scheme (http vs. https) but this is enough to cause the authentication to fail because it does not match.

I don't know why MyOpenID is sending back two different endpoints and I know this isn't exactly a bug per se but perhaps the code should be changed to verify the endpoint based only upon the host and path.

I'm looking into this. MyOpenId automatically redirects http to an https endpoint which may not be getting picked up correctly by Zend\_Openid.
