### Description

Here goes some reference guide small error:

In section 61.4.1.15:

findActive($container, $minDepth, $maxDepth) is used for finding the deepest active page in the given container. If depths are not given, the method will use the values retrieved from getMinDepth() and getMaxDepth(). The deepest active page must be between $minDepth and _$axnDepth_ inclusively. Returns an array containing a reference to the found page instance and the depth at which the page was found.
