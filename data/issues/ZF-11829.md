### Description

So I have the following code in my bootstrap which is located in myproject/application

 
    function _initSetTranslations(){
    $this->bootstrap('layout');
    $layout = $this->getResource('layout');
    $view = $layout->getView();
    }


And for example I have the following code in my layout file: <?php echo $this->render('pictureoftheday/pod.phtml') ?>

When running this I get the following error code:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script 'pictureoftheday/pod.phtml' not found in path (C:\\wamp\\www\\cluj\\application/layouts/scripts/;C:\\wamp\\www\\cluj\\application/layouts/scripts/;./views\\scripts/)' in C:\\wamp\\www\\cluj\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Plugin\\Broker.php on line 336

Now I know the file is not in my layouts/ folder but I also see it tries to check the views/scripts folder as well but the file DOES exist there yet it keeps throwing this error up.

I suspect the problem is in your configuration. If you look closely at the list of paths PHP reports that it tries, you will see this at the end:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ;./views\scripts/


Two things wrong with this:

It's a relative path, and I can almost guarantee it won't work
==============================================================

There is mixing of slashes (./views\\scripts/ is not necessarily the same as ./view/scripts)
============================================================================================

Could you post the view portions of your application.ini file and any bootstrap methods relating to the view?
