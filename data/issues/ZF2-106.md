### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Milestone+Testing) states that Zend\_Service\_Technorati will not be included in ZF2, but a test suite run after a fresh git clone results in:

```

Should the Zend\_Service\_Technorati classes and test files thus be removed, or is the Milestone Testing table not correct with regard to the Technorati service?
