### Description

Hi,

I noticed that I can use Zend\_Translate set via Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Translate in an action controller like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $translate = Zend_Registry::get('Zend_Translate');
    $translate->_('Translate this');


The \_('Translate this') is getting picked up by poedit.

Now in a view script with the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate according to the manual translating should look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?= $this->translate('Translate this') ?>


But this doesn't get picked up by poedit because it doesn't have \_('Translate this').

I got it working like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?= $this->translate()->getTranslator()->_('Translate this') ?>


I think it would be easier and neater if the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate could be used in the same way as Zend\_Translate. Something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?= $this->translate->_('Translate this') ?>

This is a simple configuration issue of poEdit and not one of ZF. Tell your parser to search for translate( additionally to \_(.

Your right, I didn't think of it that way. I added the key word "translate" to the parser and now it also indexes translatable strings that uses the translate view helper in a view script.

Thanks for your response.
