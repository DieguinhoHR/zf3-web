### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_CalendarOnlineTest::testCalendarOnlineFeed() does not contain any assert statements and so is pretty much dead code. As a result, it should be augmented with assertions for testing.

Wrote test testCalendarOnlineFeed(), mimicking testCalendarListFeed()

Note: The test makes the assumption that the Google Calendar test user's default calendar name is the same as the value of constant TESTS\_ZEND\_GDATA\_CLIENTLOGIN\_EMAIL. This is the default behavior for new Google Calendar accounts.
