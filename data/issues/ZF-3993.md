ZF-3993: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract loadClass errors not shown
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-19T02:15:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-06T07:39:24.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

In the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract on line 119 there is the following line:

@Zend\_Loader::loadClass($this->\_rowClass);

This will load the class file for the defined rowClass. However if the defined class has errors, those errors will be supressed by the @ in the Zend\_Loader line. So you won't have any idea what is going on, because the errors aren't reported anywhere.

This issue also exists in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract Lines 1168, 1213 and 1272. Errors in from syntax issues when loading custom Row and Rowset classes are suppressed making it difficult to debug.
