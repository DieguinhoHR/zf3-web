### Description

Hi,

i think that db adapter for zend\_session lacks important functionality, to be able to put some of session vars to db columns, after mapping those vars it would be easy to make a list of logged users ETC.

without the ability to map the vars like user\_id , i dont really see the reason why database would be used for session storing, it would be just a waste of resources then.
