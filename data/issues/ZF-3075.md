### Description

Unit tests for Zend\_Service\_Simpy should be refactored so that they do not contain account information, which should instead be entered as the values of constants in TestConfiguration.php by the entity running the test.

I believe this should be done for other services as well, but it is currently not a priority. Postponing for now.

I believe this was addressed in the commit to fix ZF-3077. If those refactored unit tests are running satisfactorily at this point, this issue should be marked as Fixed.
