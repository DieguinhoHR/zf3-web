### Description

I cannot get getUsageMessage method to work...it just returns a blank. Either I am doing something very wrong, or this is a bug

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try {
    $opts = new Zend_Console_Getopt(
     array(
        'user|u=s' => 'Username',
        'password|p=s' => 'Password',
        'description|d=s' => 'Description',
        'add|a' => 'Add User',
        'edit|e' => 'Edit User',
        'remove|r' => 'Remove user'
     )
    );
    $opts->parse();
    } catch (Zend_Console_Getopt_Exception $e) {
        echo "Usage Error " . $e->getUsageMessage;
        exit;
    }


[root@local1 docs]# ./usermanage.php -u test -d Usage Error [root@local1 docs]#

getUsageMessage() is a method, not an object property. So you need to call it with parens:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo "Usage Error " . $e->getUsageMessage();
