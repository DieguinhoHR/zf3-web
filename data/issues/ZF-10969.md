Your change will cause trouble. The goal is to test existence of row field. Null is a value, so we can switch for isset().

Sample: a table for users with a column last\_visited. A null value means that the user never logged. If you write :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    isset($users->last_visited);


The column exists, and the value is null.
