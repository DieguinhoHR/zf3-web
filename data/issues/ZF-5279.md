### Description

I'd like to propose the addition of an optional parameter to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::select(). Its default value should be Zend\_Db\_Select::SQL\_WILDCARD. Alternatively an array should be used, whose values correspond to fields in the current table. A quick, untested example: \\ \\

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Returns an instance of a Zend_Db_Table_Select object.
     *
     * @param  mixed $fields Fields to select from the table. Defaults to all.
     * @return Zend_Db_Table_Select
     */
    public function select($fields = Zend_Db_Select::SQL_WILDCARD)
    {
        require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Select.php';
        $select = new Zend_Db_Table_Select($this);
        $select->from($this->_name, $fields);
        return $select;
    }


Having this, one can write:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getByDestination($continentId, $countryId, $cityId)
    {
        return $this->fetchAll(
            $this->select(array('name'))
                 ->where('continent_id = ?', $continentId)
                 ->where('country_id = ?',   $countryId)
                 ->where('city_id = ?',      $cityId)
                 ->order('name ASC')
                 ->limit(10)
        );
    } 


I don't know whether this should be also applied to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::select() and Zend\_Db\_Select::\_\_construct(). In this case the passed array should probably be a multidimensional array in which keys are table names and values are arrays of fields to be fetched. Actually, Zend\_Db\_Select objects can be supported as values too.

If there's interest in these additions I'd gladly conduct further investigations inside the code base.
