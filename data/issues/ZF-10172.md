### Description

Hey Guys,

firstofall: your tool is great!

Just one thing I would like to suggest is, that a function "addMethod" would be nice. Methods are naturally a kind of ordered list inside a class and it would be much easier to use if you would not have to write an own helper function using array\_merge or so...

Of course this is just a usability feature, not such important but nice to have.

If hope you aggree.

Thank you.

Sorry I just looked up the code of setMethod() and noticed, that it alredy has this functionality.

You may close this task, but I'd like to add that it would have been better to make "set" a clear setter function overwriting values and better use "add..." to make the difference more clear.

Anyway, well done.
