ZF-2014: \_frontcontroller in Action\_Helper seems to be useless

### Description

There is a property in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract called \_frontroller. It seems to be useless as there is no method to set and the get method (which will also initialise it) are only call the singleton-pattern.

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function getFrontController()
        {
            if (null === $this->_frontController) {
                $this->_frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
            }
    
            return $this->_frontController;
        }

There is maybe no use for the property and instead the getter can ever return the singleton-instance

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function getFrontController()
        {
            return Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
        }

The $\_frontController member is set from within getFrontController() and is used to cache the value of Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance() so that repeated calls to getFrontController() do not need to do so. $this->getFrontController() is slightly faster to type.

While it may seem worthless, think of it more as a convenience method.
