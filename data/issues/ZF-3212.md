### Description

Andriess Seutens:

I have a little issue with the url helper and route matching. I think this is a critical missing feature / bug. I'm going to try to explain my issue by example:

My bootstrap file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    set_include_path('./ZendFramework-1.5.1/library');
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoLoad();
    
    $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $frontController->addControllerDirectory('./application/controllers')
        ->throwExceptions(true)
        ->returnResponse(true);
    
    $router = $frontController->getRouter();
    $router->addRoute('foo', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
        ':lang/foo',
        array(
            'lang'       => 'nl',
            'controller' => 'index',
            'action'     => 'index'
        )
    ));
    
    $router->addRoute('bar', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
        ':lang/bar',
        array(
            'lang'       => 'nl',
            'controller' => 'index',
            'action'     => 'index'
        )
    ));
    
    $response = $frontController->dispatch();
    $response->sendHeaders()
        ->outputBody();


My template file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->url(array(), 'foo') ?>
    <br></br>
    <?php echo $this->url(array(), 'bar') ?>


when i call: <http://mydomain/nl/bar> the output is:

/nl/foo /nl/bar

which is good!

if i call: <http://mydomain/en/foo> the output is

/en/foo /en/bar

which is good too!

the problem occurs when the last route in the row is matched (in this case: 'bar')

<http://test/en/bar>

output:

/nl/foo /en/bar

works for all routes after the matched one, but not the ones before.....

In order for this to work I would need to pass in the 'lang' parameter:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php echo $this->url(array('lang' =>
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRequest()->getParam('lang')),
    'foo') ?>


So, in other words: I am unable to take a url param into each route and use it with the url helper?

Probably temporary fix to inconsistent route path variables handling.

The proposed fix is in a direct conflict with the linked issue. I will fix the problem the other way - routes will not be initialized with url values on negative match. I will provide a way to use request variables in a route on a router assembly level.

Fixed in opposite way:

<http://mydomain/nl/bar> => /nl/foo, /nl/bar <http://mydomain/en/foo> => /en/foo, /nl/bar <http://mydomain/en/bar> => /nl/foo, /en/bar
