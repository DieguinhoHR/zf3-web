### Description

With ZF-1936 (<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1936>) is impossible to retrieve the complete Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::$\_translate protected property without a foreach cycle over Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::getList() and the usage of Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::getMessage() method. It's required a method to retrieve the entire dictionary. I propose Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::getDictionary().

Integrated with SVN 6611.

You can now use a new pseudo-locale "all" to get the complete dictionary. Please try this or a newer revision and give us feedback.

Closing this issue as it's already implemented and we are not getting response from the reporter.
