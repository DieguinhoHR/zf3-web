### Description

The current implementation of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row throws an exception when attempting to set the value of the primary key. This is annoying when importing records with pre-existing id's. Suggest that we allow setting the id when it's current value is null.

I can't find a way to do this without modifying Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row itself. I'm trying my hardest to not modify things so upgrades are easy. For user-specified varchar PKs this is essential (I'm going to see about changing that, but the schema might be fixed).

(fetchNew could set a flag which causes save to _not_ nullify and check the PK, or something similar)

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

Setting fields in the primary key is now permitted, as of revision 4697.
