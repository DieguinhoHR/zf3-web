### Description

But in 1.7.8 and earlier version, the get method take into account the option format\_type. So 1.78 and earlier was wrong. It is a strong change wich should be mentionned in documentation for migration. As all people working with zend\_date in php format in 1.7.8 will have to migrate code for 1.8+ versions.

New problem: I find a new bug, wich appear only with the Date.php available in the trunk directory (version Id: Date.php 18093 2009-09-13 11:35:01Z thomas) with the patch you have done for my previous problem. With the original 1.9.2 Date.php, this bug in not here, so I guess it comes from your modifications.

IsLater and IsEarlier method for zend\_date object send strange return value. Exemple:

Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Date'); Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('format\_type' => 'php')); // This bug appears only when php format is actived, with the trunck Date.php version Id: Date.php 18093 2009-09-13 11:35:01Z thomas $date1 = new Zend\_Date(); $date2 = clone $date1; $date2->add(1, Zend\_Date::DAY);

echo "Is date1 earlier than date2:".$date1->isEarlier($date2, Zend\_Date::DATES)."  
"; // return false echo "Is date2 earlier than date1:".$date2->isEarlier($date1, Zend\_Date::DATES)."  
"; // return false echo "Is date1 later than date2:".$date1->isLater($date2, Zend\_Date::DATES)."  
"; // return true echo "Is date2 later than que date1:".$date2->isLater($date1, Zend\_Date::DATES)."  
"; // return true

Results are not possible. So maybe you need to check better the correction made previously as it impacts "isEarlier" and "isLater" method which rely on "compare" / "\_calculate" methods.

Thanks again. Cheers, Thomas.

Closing as non-issue.

Note that Zend\_Date's constants are using ISO notation. When you set Zend\_Date to use GNU notation, you can no longer use Zend\_Date's constants but must set formats manually.

There is no benefit to set GNU format but use ISO instead (would be nonsense).

A warning has been added to the manual.
