### Description

[Original message by Michael Depetrillo](http://www.nabble.com/zend_db_table-and-zend_db_select-tf3673528s16154.html#a10264936):

Hello

I was wondering if it made sense to add a select($cols) helper method to Zend\_Db\_Table that would return an instance of Zend\_Db\_Select.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    Model_Lead extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract { $_name = 'leads_table'; }
    
    $lead = new Model_Lead();
    $select = $lead->select(new Zend_Db_Expr('COUNT(*)')->where('status = ?', 'pending');
    echo $select; // select COUNT(*) from leads_table
    ?>


This would be very helpful in centralizing tables names through models.

There was a typo in my original message. The example above should return "select count(\*) from leads\_table where status = ?".

A workaround that exists right now is the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $lead = new Model_Lead();
    $select = $lead->getAdapter()->select();
    $select->from($lead->info()['name'], 'COUNT(*)');
    $select->where('status = ?', 'pending');


This issue is related to ZF-836, which requests a feature of a table method fetchCount().

We aren't going to address this use case in ZF 1.0. We would like to provide a solution later, but I'm going to postpone this issue for now.

With the new Zend\_Db\_Table enhancements you can now perform

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $lead = new Model_Lead();
    $select = $lead->select();
    $select->from($lead, 'COUNT(*)')->where('status = ?', 'pending');


Does that satisfy the requirements of this request? If so I'll mark it as complete.

Michael, can you please verify that Simon's solution is adequate?
