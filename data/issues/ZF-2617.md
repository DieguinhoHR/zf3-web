Promoted to core; need to know if I should push into release-1.5 branch.

I think we can close this issue.

The new service should be promoted to branch as stated in the RC2 text from wil on 3.March. Additionally a new component should be added to jira for issues related to Nirvanix.

Promoted to release branch earlier this week per approval from Wil.
