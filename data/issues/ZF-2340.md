ZF-2340: Output buffering in Zend\_Controller and Zend\_View
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Output buffering can be configured in Zend\_Controller, but not in Zend\_View. For an average MVC setup this is just unused overhead, as two buffers are used (when someone uses smarty, another buffer is used because smarty again buffers). I would suggest to make output buffering optional in Zend\_View or remove output buffering completely and leave it to the user.

Zend\_View requires output buffering in order to do much of its work, and capturing template results for later manipulation with filters would be impossible without it.

If you are using Smarty, you should consider writing a class implementing Zend\_View\_Interface if you don't want the output buffering, instead of using smarty through a zend\_view view script.

Smarty is not the main concern. The duplicated output buffering in Zend\_Controller is the problem.

You can disable output buffering in the Zend\_Controller family by setting the 'disableOutputBuffering' param to a true value:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $front->setParam('disableOutputBuffering', true);


This setting has been present since 0.6.0.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
