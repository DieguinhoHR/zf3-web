ZF-2592: Invalid realm causing BAD\_REQUEST result from provider
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-06T17:24:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-15T10:17:37.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When doing an authorization with Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer the realm gets mangled due to the use of dirname() in $this->\_checkId() if I do not explicitly define a root when calling $consumer->login('', 'return\_to', 'root'). I don't entirely know why dirname() is being called on line 729

 
        if (empty($root)) {
            $root = dirname(Zend_OpenId::selfUrl());
        }


but when I remove the dirname(), the consumer auto-discovers the URL just fine and I'm able to validate the login request. Otherwise I get a BAD\_REQUEST response back from the OpenId provider.

This is being done with an MVC-based test application

Sorry, but I'm not able to reproduce the issue. The demo MVC application "demo/Zend/OpenId/mvc\_auth" works fine. The bug is probably already fixed some time ago (svn diff -r 6835:7023 library/Zend/OpenId.php).

In the MVC example it uses Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId whereas I had used the code from the manual:

[code] $status = ""; if (isset($\_POST['openid\_action']) && $\_POST['openid\_action'] == "login" && !empty($\_POST['openid\_identifier'])) {

 
    $consumer = new Zend_OpenId_Consumer();
    if (!$consumer->login($_POST['openid_identifier'])) {
        $status = "OpenID login failed.<br>";
    }


} else if (isset($\_GET['openid\_mode'])) { if ($\_GET['openid\_mode'] == "id\_res") { $consumer = new Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer(); if ($consumer->verify($\_GET, $id)) { $status = "VALID $id"; } else { $status = "INVALID $id"; } } else if ($\_GET['openid\_mode'] == "cancel") { $status = "CANCELED"; } }

[/code]

Is Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId the only method for using it in MVC applications?

Of course Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId is not the only case, it just simpler.

Could you please attach the complete MVC example?

 OpenID Login

At first you example says nothing in case of success. I've modified it a bit. In the controller I substituted $status with $this->view->status, and in the view I added <?php echo $this->staus; ?> Then I tested the example with myopenid.com and pip.verisignlabs.com and both worked fine.

I assume the bug was already fixed in SVN and you use latest release or old snapshot.

Thank you anyway. :)

I'm still getting the error. I checked out the latest revision from SVN, did a symbolic link to it so it replaced the other version. The URL I am forwarded to is

[http://pip.verisignlabs.com/server/…](http://pip.verisignlabs.com/server?openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fkschroeder.pip.verisignlabs.com%2F&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fkschroeder.pip.verisignlabs.com%2F&openid.assoc_handle=c1b035a0-dbd5-11dc-83c8-51f194f14af5&openid.return_to=http%3A%2F%2Ftest.corp.mirageworks.com%2F&openid.realm=http%3A)

As you can see, the realm has been chopped off. The URL I receive back is

[http://test.corp.mirageworks.com//…](http://test.corp.mirageworks.com/?openid.ns=http://openid.net/signon/2.0&openid.mode=error&openid.error=BAD_REQUEST)

This is using the most up-to-date revision from <http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk> (8026). Or is the anonymous SVN at <http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk> not current?

Thank you for your persistence. Now I reproduced the bug and fixed it.
