### Description

I've tried to derive my own class from Zend\_Auth\_Result and add some more failure codes. But there is a code segment in Zend\_Auth\_Result::\_\_constructor wich blocks me from doing that.

[code] if ($code < self::FAILURE\_UNCATEGORIZED) { $code = self::FAILURE; } elseif ($code > self::SUCCESS ) { $code = 1; } [/code]

Because FAILURE\_UNCATEGORIZED is -4, i can't use a negative value lower than that. If FAILURE\_UNCATEGORIZED would be e.g. -65535 there would be enough values.
