ZF-10503: Zend\_Mail::\_filterName does not filter ':'
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hello,

When an email is sent, ':' character is not allowed in the sender name as it is to represent a group (rfc2822).

this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_mail = new Zend_Mail('UTF-8');
    $this->_mail->setFrom("john.doe@orange.fr", "John:Doe");


will produce this header:

bq.From: John:Doe [john.doe@orange.fr](mailto:john.doe@orange.fr)

And it is not correct.

I suggest to disallow ':' in \_filterName

 
    <pre class="highlight">

                           '>'  => ']',


I got some really weird results without that patch when an user try to have a sender name with ':'. That is my first contribution to ZF and I hope it can help.
