### Description

Problem: When performing MX and Deep validation I receive the following error "Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress::\_binaryToIp()".

Problem Source: Lines 365 and 366 call a method called $this->\_binaryToIp() however, this method doesn't exist. A method called \_toIp() does exist and based on the method description it indicates a binary string to an IP address conversion takes place.

Reproducing: Trying to validate "asdf@asdasdasd.com" with the following form element reproduces the error.

 
        $this->addElement(
            'text', 'email', array(
                'label' => 'Your Email Address',
                'required' => true,
                'filters' => array('StringTrim'),
                'validators' => array(
                    array('EmailAddress', true, array(
                        'mx' => true,
                        'deep' => true
                    ))
                )
            )
        );


Verify Problem: Performing a grep on the Zend library indicates a method called $this->\_binaryToIp does not exist. It looks like the problem was introduced in revision 18050.

Correction: Replacing $this->\_binaryToIp to $this->\_toIp corrected the problem.
