### Description

As both Roles and Resources can be added to a Zend\_Acl object testing for the existence of a Resource should be a method similarly named to the one that checks a role ( hasRole() ).

has() should alias hasResource() (or vice versa)

Could be done in the next minor release, only that not is in the plans of the team ZF a minor release.

If there changes of plans, i agree in make the method has() throw a trigger with message of method deprecated, until because this issue already was done in ZF2.

Greetings Ramon
