### Description

This is extremely minor, but in Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_File::open() an exception is thrown if the fopen call fails. The fopen call acts upon $this->\_filename, but the exception references $filename in it's message. This means that if this fails when open() is called with no arguments, but the filename member of the object is set, the exception will say: 'Log file "" could not be opened' I would assume that this also affects the other adapters.

The solution is simple, change the following on line 189: throw new Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_Exception("Log file \\"$filename\\" could not be opened"); to: throw new Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_Exception("Log file \\"{$this->\_filename}\\" could not be opened");
