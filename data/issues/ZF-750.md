### Description

When Zend\_Gdata\_AuthSub::getAuthSubSessionToken() was first created, some issues with SSL and Zend\_Http\_Client required to wrap the connection command in output bufferring statements in order to avoid a warning thrown by PHP. This was an ugly hack - but at the time I didn't find any way to avoid it.

Since then several fixes to Zend\_Http\_Client were introduced, and I'm quite sure the warning will be avoided now - and there is no need for the ugly ob\_start() and ob\_end\_clean() statements.

They should be removed from lines 102 and 108 (revision 2759). If any socket related warnings are thrown, a bug should be opened for Zend\_Http\_Client.
