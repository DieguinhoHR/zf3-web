ZF-8172: Exposing more than object Key in S3 getObjectsByBucket
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-10-28T11:25:54.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:16.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Could Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::getObjectsByBucket() have an additional parameter to make it return the other parameters from GET Bucket? or as another function? These currently are retrieved as part of the API call and discarded in favour of just returning the Key for each file.

Without this functionality, there is no way, other than to repeatedly call getInfo with the results from the function (which is extremely wasteful in time and cost), to get the LastModified/ETag/Size etc of the files in a bucket, something that folder sync applications would need to do regularly.
