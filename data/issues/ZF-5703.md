### Description

I'm trying to use my own upload Zend\_Form class with a file element and (setMaxFileSize) to auto create the hidden MAX\_FILE\_SIZE field. Using this class in my app gives a Fatal Error: Your 'post\_max\_size' config settings exceeds the 'memory\_limit' setting. You should fix this.

Well, for many years I'm handling file uploads with php and never ever used more than a 128MB max\_mem\_size, even with 1Gb wire speed uploads I'm using 64MB max. The php settings affected to successfully upload files are in my believe:

- upload\_max\_filesize
- post\_max\_size
- max\_input\_time

When the HTTP POST is successfully received and the php script starts doing funny things like copy, rename, etc the max\_execution\_time comes in. _IF_ there are scenario's the memory\_limit should be set at at least the post\_max\_size, could you please make this a Notice, instead of a Fatal error. Currently I've to set insane memory\_limit values to accept 1GB form uploads or create the hidden field manually.

When your memory settings are lower than your post filesize settings than you are not able to receive files which exceed the memory limit, as the posted data can not be received.

You can read this within PHP's manual within the php.ini directives: {quote} Generally speaking, memory\_limit should be larger than post\_max\_size. {quote}

And when you switch off the memory limit (-1) then you will also not get an error triggered.
