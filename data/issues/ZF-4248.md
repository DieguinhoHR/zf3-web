### Description

bug containing revision: 11362

You'll still get errors on uploading files with Zend\_Form\_Element\_File although the field is not required. The cause of the problem is, that the line 162 in Zend\_Form\_Element\_File.php $adapter->setOptions(array('ignoreNoFile' => true)); does not take effect.

Solution: (Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract class on line 476)

old: $this->\_options += $options;

fixed: $this->\_options = $options + $this->\_options;

yes, the feature of revision 11364 ( - added options check to prevent illegal options) fixed the bug automatically.
