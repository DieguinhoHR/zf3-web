### Description

Some methods in Zend\_Rest\_Client like restGet call Zend\_Http\_Client#request, which may throw Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception. (For example when you cannot connect to the server)

exception 'Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception' with message 'Unable to Connect to <a>tcp://webservices.amazon.co.jp:80</a>. Error #14851561: ' in C:\\xampp\\php\\PEAR\\Zend\\Http\\Client\\Adapter\\Socket.php:148 Stack trace:

0 C:\\xampp\\php\\PEAR\\Zend\\Http\\Client.php(863): Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket->connect('webservices.ama...', 80, false)
==================================================================================================================================

1 C:\\xampp\\php\\PEAR\\Zend\\Rest\\Client.php(135): Zend\_Http\_Client->request('GET')
=======================================================================================

2 C:\\xampp\\php\\PEAR\\Zend\\Service\\Amazon.php(103): Zend\_Rest\_Client->restGet('/onca/xml', Array)
=======================================================================================================

The exception must be caught and rethrow as Zend\_Rest\_Exception, or suppress and set the error code in the object. You may want to check ZF-6630 to decide which fix should be better.

Try search with '->request' or something in the Zend\_Rest\_Client class to know other places to fix.

Classes generally do not interfere with the exceptions thrown from dependencies unless there's a good reason to. This allows the full exception to fall through to the user by design - obviously they should be aware of general exceptions. Intercepting an Exception is useful when there is a secondary option to cover the failure, but otherwise a rethrow does nothing but change the exception name and type, and modify the message attached and details of the back trace.

Unless there's a compelling reason to change the current method beyond a preference, this will not be fixed.
