### Description

Zend\_View::render() currently allows script names that include parent directory notation -- which could lead to a potential local filesystem inclusion exploit if provided unfiltered user input. As view scripts should only ever match _beneath_ the registered view script directories, render() (or \_script()) should filter for this sort of input and raise an exception when such input is detected.

Based on ZF-5724 submission, but specific to render() vs. the script paths.
