I think, that fetchCol() is intended for sql queries like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT nickname FROM Users;


Defined column is not good way to do this, you should optimize your queries to select just column you need.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
