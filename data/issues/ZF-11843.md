### Description

DEFAULT\_PERSISTENT\_STORAGE\_ADAPTER constant is set to 'Session'.

Result:

After getting the user agent object from the bootstrap and making the getDevice() call, the following error is thrown:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'ExceptionInvalidSession' with message 'We didn't recognize either your username or password. Try again.'

Expected:

DEFAULT\_PERSISTENT\_STORAGE\_ADAPTER constant is set to 'Zend\_Http\_UserAgent\_Storage\_Session' and device object is returned.

The issue can be circumvented by overriding the constant by passing in an array of options before making getDevice() call.

E.g:

$bootstrap = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap'); $userAgent = $bootstrap->getResource('useragent');

$userAgent->setOptions( array( 'storage' => array( 'adapter' => 'Zend\_Http\_UserAgent\_Storage\_Session' ) ) );

I am unable to find how to attach the following diff:

You can only attach patches to tickets if you've signed a Zend Framework developer CLA.

As for your problem, could you provide code to show how you are using Zend\_Http\_UserAgent? Specifically, where is the error being raised from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'ExceptionInvalidSession' with message 'We didn't recognize either your
    username or password. Try again.'


AFAIK, that isn't something that Zend Framework would raise/throw.

The default value for DEFAULT\_PERSISTENT\_STORAGE\_ADAPTER is correct, as internally Zend\_Http\_UserAgent uses a plugin broker to automatically locate the storage adapter based upon that short name (ie: plugin broker prepends 'Zend\_Http\_UserAgent\_Storage\_' to that value to get the full class name and then attempts to autoload the class (from Zend/Http/UserAgent/Storage/Session.php))
