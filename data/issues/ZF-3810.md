ZF-3810: update Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_File to default the value of 'lifetime' to null, so cached entries will not expire

### Description

Given that the entire premise of Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_File is to automatically flush the cache entries whenever the file being watched is updated, it would seem logical that the default 'lifetime' value for the Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_File should be 'null' so that the cache entries would never expire.

The current default 'lifetime' value is 3600 seconds (1 hour), the same that is set for Zend\_Cache\_Core.

ok, but I can't change the default behaviour until an API break

It's not logical to set difference default lifetimes to deifferent backends.
