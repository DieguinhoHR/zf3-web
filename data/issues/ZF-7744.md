ZF-7744: Zend\_Search\_Lucene does not support compressed fields

### Description

I created an index with Apache Lucene 2.3.2 which included a text field that was stored compressed. Zend\_Search\_Lucene wasn't able to read the index correctly, but didn't throw a meaningful error either. Instead it told me that the documents didn't contain the (not compressed) fields I was trying to read. When I changed the code so that the field would be stored uncompressed, everything worked fine.

I searched your website, but I couldn't find a hint to that missing feature anywhere. It would be nice if the manual would at least state that this component doesn't support compressed fields yet. There is already an appropriate chapter for that: [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.java-lucene.html)].
