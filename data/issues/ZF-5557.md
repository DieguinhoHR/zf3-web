ZF-5557: non existent tables cause errors for SHOW TABLES
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The following code snippets will produce the same error if trying to work on a non existent table;

//set table name $resTableName = 'non\_existent\_table'; //case 1 $result = $db->fetchAll($db->select()->from($resTableName)); //case 2 $sql = "show tables like '{$resTableName}';"; $db->getConnection()->exec($sql);

The error is

Message: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active. Consider using PDOStatement::fetchAll(). Alternatively, if your code is only ever going to run against mysql, you may enable query buffering by setting the PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_USE\_BUFFERED\_QUERY attribute.

There is a workaround suggested but I don't know whether we should accept this error.

my workaround (if it helps others) In my case I just want to know if a table exists. the following works;

$sql = "show tables like '{$resTableName}';"; $result = $db->fetchAll($sql);

in the event of success, you will get a populated array. If the table doesn't exist you will get $result = array[0]

This is not a bug with the Zend Framework. If anything, the error message would need to be changed in PDO.
