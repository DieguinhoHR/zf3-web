### Description

There is wrong type chosen for "timestamp" as "real". It represents timestamp as 1.29716e+09 which is quite coarse and often leads to duplicate messages. The solution is to choose "double precision" or "bigint" with refactoring to integer value insted of float microtime.

I attach a patch which fixes Postgres schema

This issue still exists in trunk. Can the maintainer of Zend\_Queue, or someone else familiar with it's operation, please comment on the suggested fix? Are there any BC-break issues with changing the schema?

While this might fix the schema; unfortunately this issue would then exist in other schemas. The patch itself on this one would work appropriately; specifically speaking this mainly is only utilized when receiving messages (see Zend/Queue/Adapter/AdapterAbstract.php). Update during this method will store the microtime (result of microtime(true)) in which case he is correct. However, this should not lead to duplicate messages.

Fixed in trunk (25064) and release-1.12.1 (25065)
