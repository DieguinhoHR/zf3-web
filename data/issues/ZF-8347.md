Hi!

I can't reproduce it in my environment. It's probably fixed by some later commit or something happened with test index included into unit tests (something wrong with svn?).

Could you try to check out branch once again and pass Zend\_Search\_Lucene unit tests using this clear copy?

I'm closing the issue now, please reopen it if problem still exists.

Problem is marked as duplicate of [ZF-8809] issue (it's actualy a subset of [ZF-8809])
