### Description

When attempting to do the following in a Controller Plugin: \\ \\

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        .
        .
        .
        public function preDispatch($request)
        {
            $bootstrap = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap');
    


It fails as the bootstrap parameter is not being set upon $this->dispatch() within the X\_ControllerTestCase.

Could a $this->run($url) which mimics the Zend\_Application::run() be added, that sets the bootstrap param and then executes the dispatch?

Using Zend\_Application is not a pre-requisite of using the controller components, and thus, not a pre-requisite of testing your controllers. This can _easily_ be accomplished by the developer in the setUp of their tests.

ZF-8193 includes a work-around for this. As Jason Webster suggested earlier, another work-around involves doing something like the example below in setUp() of the test case. Thanks to [~ralph] for coming up with this code.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setUp()
    {
        // $this->bootstrap = ...
        parent::setUp();
        $this->getFrontController()->setParam('bootstrap', $this->bootstrap->getBootstrap());
    }
