### Description

Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract does not handle file uploads when no file is uploaded by the user.

Example code

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $f = new Zend_Form();
    $f->addElement('file', 'photo', array(
        'label' => 'photo',
        'required'=> false
    ))
      ->addElement('submit', 'save', array('label' => 'btn_save'));
    
    if($_POST && $f->isValid($_POST)) {
      echo 'valid';
    }
    
    echo $f->render(new Zend_View());


Exception is thrown when form is submitted: "photo" not found by file transfer adapter The problem is on line 572, Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php, where validation does not consider option ignoreNoFile for the adapter.

I forgot the 'multipart/form-data' encoding, my bet, can be closed
