This issue is [ZF-5770] related.

If PHP is compiled with '--with-openssl' option, this issue appears instead of [ZF-5770] issue output.

To clarify, this was caused by ZF-5779, and resolved by r14085.

A new online test was being run when it shouldn't have been. Since authentication credentials weren't set, this was causing Google's servers to return a CAPTCHA challenge.

    [ZF-5779]        Fixing bug where I accidentally put
                     an online test into the /Gdata/YouTube
                     test directory.
