### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli does not return consistent null for failed matches using fetch() from the statement class due to // fetch the next result $retval = $this->\_stmt->fetch(); switch ($retval) { case null: // end of data case false: // error occurred $this->\_stmt->reset(); return $retval; default: // fallthrough }

it should return false like every other class if it is going to work with zend\_validate\_db\_\*'s if ($result !== false) {

After discussion with Ralph Schindler, the strict equality checking has been changed in commit 14028

Erasing Zend\_Validate\_\* as there is actually no DB validator in core.

After discussing with [~bittarman] we should return false as the $retval for consistency with other adapters. Null has no real semantic meaning in Zend\_Db\_Statement.

Evaluating and assigning to [~bittarman]
