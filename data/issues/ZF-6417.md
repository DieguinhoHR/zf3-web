### Description

When calling createRow() from a Zend\_Db\_Table object that have a custom row class, it throws an exception, because Zend\_Loader::loadClass is called unconditionally, no matter whether a custom \_\_autoload was implemented. Same problem in Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchRow() and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset constructor.
