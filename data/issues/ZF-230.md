### Description

From zf manual:

17.2.3. View Script Paths By default, Zend\_View expects your view scripts to be in the same directory as the controller script.

Actually this is not true ^^

It actually expects it in the PATH enviroment variable, starting from the current directory... unless you set it yourself. So it is partially true.
