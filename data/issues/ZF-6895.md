ZF-6895: Zend\_Mail should have hooks for init() and possibly \_preSend()

### Description

It would be helpful to have hooks in Zend\_Mail such that child classes only need to implement init() (called from parent::\_\_construct()) and perhaps \_preSend() (called as the first line of parent::send())

This would allow users to do some trivial setup, for instance adding a default BCC to every outgoing mail, without worrying about overriding core functions.

This is not necessary. If you extend Zend\_Mail anyways its (almost) as simple to overwrite those methods. Since Zend\_Mail is a utility class that is easily extendable (in contrast to classes which are deeply rooted in the MVC process) init and pre sent hooks are not necessary.
