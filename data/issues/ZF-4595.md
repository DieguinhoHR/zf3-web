### Description

Just hooked up 1.6.2 o my existing app and file uploading seems to blow up when using Zend\_Form\_Element\_File.

The error message is:

Notice: Undefined index: filters in /home/colinseaman/ZendFramework-1.6.2/library/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 796

Fatal error: Unsupported operand types in /home/colinseaman/ZendFramework-1.6.2/library/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 796

Here's my code. I'm not rendering the form using the default Zend\_Form layout, instead I'm passing the elements to a view and echo'ing them out one by one. My view script is underneath.

class forms\_testForm extends Zend\_Form {

public function \_\_construct() {

 
        $uploadPath = Application::instance()->getUploadpaths('profile');    
        $image1 = new Zend_Form_Element_File('image1');
        $image1->setLabel('Upload an image:')
                        ->setRequired(false)
                        ->setDestination($uploadPath)
                        ->addValidator('Count', true, 1)     // ensure only 1 file        
                        ->addValidator('Size', true, 102400) // limit to 100K        
                        ->addValidator('Extension', true, 'jpg,png,gif'); 
    
        $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('upload');
        $submit->setLabel('Upload');
    
    
    
        $this->addElements(array($image1, $submit));
    
    
    }


}

// View Script

 Upload a photo for your profile' <?php echo $this->form->image1 ?> <?php echo $this->form->upload ?> This worked fine with 1.6.1. Have tested this with 1.7PR1 but same error

This has already been fixed on trunk. But due to code freeze this fix is not in the Sanity Check Packages
