### Description

Since 1.8 and the possability to setup a DB connection in the config file, it is not possible to define the label of the profiler output in firebug. (The only way to do this currently is to init the profiler class with the label in the contstructor and call $db->setProfiler($profiler); )

there should be a setLabel() method like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Set Label
     * @param string $label Label in Firebug
     */
    public function setLabel($label)
    {
        $this->_label = $label;
    }
