### Description

Currently I have the following code to have this implemented:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class New_View_Helper_FormFile extends Zend_View_Helper_FormFile
    {
         public function formFile($name, $value = null, $attribs = null)
         {
            $xhtml = parent::formFile($name, $value, $attribs);
            
            $endTag = ' />';
            if (($this->view instanceof Zend_View_Abstract) && !$this->view->doctype()->isXhtml()) {
                $endTag= '>';
            }
            
            if (isset($attribs['size']))
            {
                $xhtml .= '

to have MAX\_FILE\_SIZE implemented. May be it can be implemented into ZF soon.
