ZF2-83: customNaming not set in CacheManager
--------------------------------------------

### Description

Whenever you try to pass in "customBackendNaming" or "customFrontendNaming" in the setTemplateOptions() method it is always false when the Cache factory is called. I have found that it's a bug in the \_mergeOptions() method. The customNaming options are missing here so they are not combined into the merged array.

The cache component has been refactored and (if) the cache manager will be refactored it will not using custom[Frontend|Backend]Naming any more.
