### Description

The Demo included for Youtube

Zend/Gdata/App.php is missing the require\_once for Http.php

This results in: PHP Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Uri\_Http' not found in Zend/Gdata/App.php on line 643

This results in a Fatal Error that is showing up on the boards from time to time and being closed as solved.

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'duplicate' don't need a fix version.
