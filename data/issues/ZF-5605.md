Because there is not in branches/release-1.7/library but only in trunk/library in SVN. You can find the component in minor release .

I suggest you try Anonymous Checkout temporarily [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Subversion+Standards)

ok, I will checkout it from SVN, but it is step back for me. There was the library in 1.7.2 full-version.

I copied to branch-1.7 . Then you will find at 1.7.4 release.
