### Description

Would be great to have a backend cache component, which will hold information in static variable, in memory.

This is the implementation, which could be used "as is" or with some corrections: [http://code.google.com/p/fazend/â€¦](http://code.google.com/p/fazend/source/browse/trunk/FaZend/Cache/Backend/Memory.php?r=1548)

This looks like Zend\_Registry.

Right, but Zend\_Registry doesn't implement Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface, and thus can't be used in caching.

Desired use case:

$cache = Zend\_Cache::factory( 'Core', new Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memory(), ); Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::setDefaultMetadataCache($cache);

This is planned on refactoring and named Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Array

This issue is now fixed in ZF2-136

I removed the flag to be fixed in ZF2 to feel free implementing it for ZF1.
