### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/100>

I use the registry in my index.php to create a singleton instance of Zend\_View. I then set the view's variables in my controllers and render. However, sometimes I want to render two views in a single page request, like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    someAction() {
        $view = Zend::registry("view");
        $view->firstName = "Roger";
        $view->lastName = "Moore";
        echo $view->render("showPerson.php");
    
        /* I would like the ability to clear view parameters from a
           controller so that the second call to render does not have
           access to the first call to render's parameters:
    
           $view->clearParams();
         */
    
        $view->header = "Data table";
        $view->tableData = array(...);
        echo $view->render("showDataTable.php");
    }


The issue with constructing a new Zend\_View for every render is that there are many settings (setViewPath(), addHelperPath(), etc.) that would have to be set several times in the same \*Action() method.

Patch for this issue, added public method clearParams()

Implemented as clearVars() (to be consistent with naming scheme in Zend\_View), and added in revision 1481.
