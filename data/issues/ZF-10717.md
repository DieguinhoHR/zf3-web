ZF-10717: Unexpected result when using addMonth
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-19T18:38:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:32.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When adding one month to January of any year with extend\_month option set to false, the result of addMonth(1) is in March rather than February--two months later!

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->set('2011-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd');
    print $date . "\n";
    $date->addMonth(1);
    print $date . "\n";


Actual Result:

Jan 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM Mar 3, 2011 12:00:00 AM

Expected Result:

Jan 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM Feb 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM

If I set extend\_month to true, the result is correct, but then there will be problems with other operations, so it's not a viable workaround.

Did you try the latest version of the Zend Framework?

I am not able to reproduce this behaviour.

Which locale has been used? Which timezone has been used? Which options have been used?
