### Description

Hi everyone. I've just found a bug in the ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_DatePicker class in \_resolveLocaleToDatePickerFormat() function. I set up zend\_locale to en, so first part the result of Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDateFormat() method is MMM, which is equivalent to M in date() function. The \_resolveLocaleToDatePickerFormat() function makes it as 'mmm' not 'M'. The problem is in str\_replace() function, because shorter strings are at the beginning of array map, so str\_replace() repleaced 3 times 'M' by 'm'.

Hope you know what I mean.

can you give me the complete Zend\_Locale format and the expected Javascript result? I have fixed it here, though i don't know if its correct.

Oyy! My Zend\_Locale format is: 'MMM d, yyyy' and after the replacement I suppose to get 'M d, yy'.
