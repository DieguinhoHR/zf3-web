ZF-673: Setting $\_POST or $\_GET to NULL creates problem for Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http may cause an error after using Zend\_Filter\_Input where $\_POST (or $\_GET) is set to NULL when using strict filtering, e.g.:

$filterPost = new Zend\_Filter\_Input($\_POST);

The problem occurs in this method of Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getParams()
    {
        return $this->_params + $_GET + $_POST;
    }


causing a "_Fatal error:_ Unsupported operand types in .../Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php on line 601" because $\_POST is NULL. I guess this is a problem with Zend\_Filter\_Input which could be fixed by setting $\_POST to an empty array instead of NULL when using strict filtering.

A simple workaround for now is to turn off strict filtering:

$filterPost = new Zend\_Filter\_Input($\_POST, false);

Assigning to Darby. Scheduling for 0.8 release.

One cannot expect to "reset" the $\_POST variable to null, an array, or any other value for that matter, without consequences when working with other code that depends on $\_POST. In general, I think it cannot be best practices to empty the superglobals or to destroy the reference to the source data provided to a method. In any case, the component does not prevent another reference to the source data from existing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mypost = $_POST;
    $zfi = new Zend_Filter_Input($_POST);
    // $mypost is unaffected
