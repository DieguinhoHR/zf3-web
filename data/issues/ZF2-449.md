ZF2-449: Annotations and checkbox
---------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-08-05T01:05:58.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:01.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Example //@Annotation\\Type("Zend\\Form\\Element\\Checkbox") protected $isOpen;

It is impossible to set isOpen value to false.

if required=true or allowEmpty=false then NotEmpty validator is automatically added.

This treats false as empty value and value can't be set, as validation fails.

Some changes were made to Checkbox recently that might fix this: [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/263d87711eed92e24dbfecca2ac5ad6c73167d1b)

Could you try getting latest and retesting?
