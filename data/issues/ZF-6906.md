### Description

Hey, I am using the dedicated server from 1and1, and its running the php5.0.4, in this case, when I use the ZF 1.8, it will display many fatal errors such as T\_ARRAY, countable... I cannot change the php version from that server, tried many times, thats failed. That Fedora version is too old, and their server administrator does not support the custom of the server. So, please tell me how to solve the problem. Thank you

Regards,

Jacky

As [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html),

Version 5.2.4 or later is recommended.

Clarification: as of 1.7.0, our minimum supported version is 5.2.4. With 1.0 and above, the minimum supported version was 5.1.4. I'm surprised that the reporter hasn't noticed issues before this, actually.
