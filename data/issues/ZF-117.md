### Description

The manual ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.service.amazon.html)) has the following table:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Table 14.2. Zend_Service_Amazon_Image Properties
    Name    Type    Description
    Url     string  Remote URL for the Image


However, Url is actually of type Zend::Uri, as per Zend/Service/Amazon/Image.php line 43. Trying to echo out Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Image::Url would result in an error.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
