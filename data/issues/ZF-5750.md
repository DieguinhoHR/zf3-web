ZF-5750: image/pjpeg not included in default $mimetype array
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Internet explorer (checked with version 7) can treat uploaded images as image/pjpeg which then fails the validation of the following simple code:

$element = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File("categoryImage"); $element->setLabel("Image") ->setDestination('./public/uploads/') ->addValidator('IsImage', false); $form->addElement($element);

Not sure if its a bug or an improvement as this issue is related to IEs handling of content types - its fine in safari, firefox etc. Suggest that 'image/pjpeg' be added to the array list which then solved the issue for me. A google search for 'pjpeg internet explorer' will show other (non-zf) users with the same issue.

The problem is that this mimetype is not defined in the standards. The IsImage validator checks only for known standard images types defined by IANA.

So when you want to accept this special type of mime you need to use the MimeType validator and use "image" as mimetype.

But this would also accept types like "image/my\_own\_mimeimagetype"
