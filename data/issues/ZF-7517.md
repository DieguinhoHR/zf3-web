ZF-7517: Add isTranslated() method to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In most of my projects i use the new possibility to add translateable routes. In any multilanguage project youhave to provide a language switch. My Project uses a lot of routes, not all of them are multilanguage routes.

To build such a language switch (i.e. in the footer of the page) i define a link for every supported language.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <a href="">English</a>
    <a href="">Deutsch</a>


If the user browse through the page, some of the routes choosen are no multilangue routes and therefore the @locale parameter is build in the url and is not interpreted because the other routes does't know @locale.

First question: Is it possible to ask the router if the choosen route could possible handle multilanguage urls?

Second question: I have seen, in the ...Router\_Route Class, the @locale is only interpreted, if a multilanguage segment is defined in the route. At the moment, i have no chance to ask the Route "Do you have multilanguage segments?".

My solution is: - Get the Current Route and check if it is an instance of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route - I extend the Router\_Route Class and add an method isTranslated() which simply returns the $\_isTranslated flag, so i can check this case, too.

Is there an easier way, i have't seen yet?

Regards, Thorsten Ruf
