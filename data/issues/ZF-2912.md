### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ContextSwitch class constructor takes one parameter; as the helper broker doesn't allow for constructor parameters when it instantiates helpers, it should be removed. The parameter is not used in the method body.

A small clarification: If you wished to instantiate the ContextSwitch helper and pass it to the helper broker manually, you could of course specify a parameter to its constructor for configuration. Either setOptions() or setConfig() should be called if the parameter is not null.

You can instantiate the helper manually and pass it to the helper broker; allowing for options in the constructor simply simplifies this to a single step.

Not an issue.

An issue still exists however where by the constructor parameter $options is not used in the constructor body. If it is not null it should be passed to either setOptions() or setConfig().
