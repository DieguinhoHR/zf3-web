### Description

Don't know if this still needs to be open It seems to be differences in PHP version? maybe?

Attributes: array('onChange' => 'alert("hello"); ') <--- Does not work in php 5.2.6

but array('onChange' => 'alert(\\'zoo\\'); ') <---- Does work

Using 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 on one server the formSelect helper is not rendering correctly. s?

Server details: Apache/2.2.9 (Unix) DAV/2 mod\_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8h PHP/5.2.6

Code: <?php echo $this->formSelect('frm\_campus\_id', null, array('onChange' => 'alert("hello"); '), $this->campusArray); ?>

Using Firebug - I can see that it is rendering like this: - Select -BBAC Campustest

To me you should be assigning the onChange event with javascript in the view instead of trying to add it to the attribute to create proper html code.
