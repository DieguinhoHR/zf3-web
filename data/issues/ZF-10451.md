ZF-10451: Query is not properly escaped for ENUM field.

### Description

This part of the ZF DB Select generated query is invalid if the interval column is an ENUM. WHERE (date\_start = '2010-1-01') AND (interval = 'month') AND (county\_id = 4)

This works. WHERE (date\_start = '2010-1-01') AND ('interval' = 'month') AND (county\_id = 4)

This will work, but if I don't quote the interval name I get an error.

$where = $dataTable->select() ->where('date\_start = ?',$date\_start) ->where("'interval' = ?", 'month') ->where('county\_id = ?', $location\_id) ; $existing\_entries = $dataTable->fetchAll($where);

The error. SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 'month') AND (county\_id = 4)' at line

I tried also to bind the params and I get this. SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: no parameters were bound

Closing as not an issue.

Using interval as a field name, means you must quote the identifier correctly (as it is a mysql reserved keyword). Using a ' as you have, is not the correct quoting for a field identifier, it should usually be backticks `. to do this, you should always make sure you use Zend\_Db\_Adapter::quoteIdentifier() (from an adapter instance) to quote any identifiers which also happen to be a reserved rdbms keyword. this will ensure correct identifier quoting.
