### Description

When 1 - dojoConfig (parseOnLoad = false) 2 - Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo::$\_useProgrammatic = true

On class Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container method registerDijitLoader register js loader as OnLoad function and its appended to onload array in this case any other registered onLoad function will be executed before the dijit loader and all the widgets will not be available because the dojo parser didn't run yet.

Its should be unshifted to the onload array

array\_unshift($this->\_onLoadActions, $js);

Thanks
