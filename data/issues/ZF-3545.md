ZF-3545: set() does not return Zend\_Date object
------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Date::set() returns a string or integer instead of the Zend\_Date Object, preventing the use of method chaining. Setters, as a general rule, should return the method's object instead of the value that you just set.

This is not a bug.

As stated within the API the generic set method returns string/integer. When you want to have a object returned you must use the specialized setter functions.

This is because Zend\_Date provides both ways. When setting a date sometimes it is automatically corrected.

The only way to see if this has happened without parsing the object again is to get the real result as string.

So: If you need object... use the functions which return object... If you need string... use the functions which return string...
