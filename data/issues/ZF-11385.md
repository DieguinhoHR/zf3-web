ZF-11385: Zend\_Json doesn't seem to count recursion correctly

### Description

The following XML fragment has a nested depth of 6. It however throws a maxRecursion error ($maxRecursionDepthAllowed is set to 25). If I remove any one of the nodes below, it translates perfectly. So it is counting across nodes as well.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $body = <<success200 OKABCDEFGHABCDEABCDEABCABCD0.0790269374847
    EOF;
    
    header('Content-type', 'text/json');
    echo Zend_Json::fromXml($body, true);


If I add these lines in \_processXml to see what's going on:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Debug::dump($recursionDepth);
    Zend_Debug::dump($simpleXmlElementObject);


... I find that it is counting every node laterally rather than by depth.

I was able to reproduce your issue against SVN tag release-1.11.6 using the XML you provided, but not against trunk. It appears that this issue was eliminated in 1.11.7 with the fix for ZF-3257 (fromXml functionality was rewritten).

Here are my tests, both of which pass:

Just realized that when I slimmed-down the XML, it kinda defeated the purpose of the tests. I've made it right. Merged updated tests to trunk in r24409 and release-1.11 in r24410
