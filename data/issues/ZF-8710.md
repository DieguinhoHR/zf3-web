ZF-8710: Zend\_Form\_Element\_MultiCheckbox is Valid problem

### Description

Hi,

Seems the isValid for Zend\_Form\_Element\_MultiCheckbox has a problem.

If to isValid is posted an array() (so no real values, none of the checkbox are checked) then the isValid is actually selecting all the elements as checked...
