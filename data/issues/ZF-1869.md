ZF-1869: Test Coverage of case folding and describe table

### Description

I wrote a couple of unit tests to cover different types of case folding to make sure that describeTable() obeys the case folding property.

Please use them if you think they may be helpful for the other adapters -- I only tested using the ibm\_db2 adapter and the incubator PDO\_IBM adapter.

The tests are modeled after the existing testAdapterOptionCaseFoldingXXX() methods and are called:

testAdapterDescribeTableNaturalCase() testAdapterDescribeTableUpperCase() testAdapterDescribeTableLowerCase()

There is also a helper method \_testAdapterDescribeTableCaseCommon()

Each test takes a form similar to the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = $this->_util->getParams();
            
    $params['options'] = array(
                Zend_Db::CASE_FOLDING => Zend_Db::CASE_UPPER);
                
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($this->getDriver(), $params);
    $products = 'zfproducts';
    
    $desc = $db->describeTable($products); 
    $product_id = 'PRODUCT_ID';
    
    $this->assertTrue(array_key_exists($product_id, $desc));        
    $this->assertEquals($desc[$product_id]['COLUMN_NAME'], $product_id, 'Upper case does not match in describe table');

Please review the added tests for possible inclusion in the test suite if appropriate

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Did you try this on any other unit tests other than Db2 by chance? They dont work against MySQL.
