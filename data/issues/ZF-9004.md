### Description

... Within the constructor it defines all allowed image mime types but you can't define really all. I think it's better to remove all 'image/\*' types and add a simple 'image' to allowed mime list.

For example currently "image/pjpeg" isn't an image.

Nope:

This would unsecure this validator as someone could simply set a own type like "image/blabla" which would then be accepted.

On the other hand there are some mimetypes which are NO images and still use the image mimetype (image processing programs). These are actually NOT accepted by this validator.

The existing list of mimetypes is build from the official accepted mimetype list. You can still add own mimetypes or also set "images" when you want to get unsecure.

Other image-types could be added per request, but until now there was none.

He can set an own type to one of the accepted type (e.g. "image/jpeg"), too. Additionally is has only effect if headerCheck is activated and no mimetype functions are available.
