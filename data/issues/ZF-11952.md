ZF-11952: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname should instantiate Zend\_Validate\_Ip or completely ignore when not set

### Description

Currently Zend\_Validate\_Hostname does several calls on $this->\_options['ip'] - whether set or not, resulting in fatal error "call to a member function on a non-object". In my opinion, a fatal error should always be prevented, so either set a default ip validator or ignore all portions where one would be needed.

The bug described at <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11239> is good enough to replicate the issue.

PHP 5.3.8 Zend Engine v2.3.0

Could not reproduce against trunk.

The ip option will always be set to a valid IP validator. When the Hostname validator is instantiated, the supplied options ($options) are merged with the default set of options ($this->\_options) and passed to setOptions. Due to the fact that $this->\_options has an ip key defined (as null), setOptions will call setIpValidator and a new instance of Zend\_Hostname\_Ip will be instantiated.
