### Description

Hi everyone! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. On my test-server, Zend\_Cache works properly. I'm using 'Page' (Frontend) and 'File' (backend). I'm using the cache->start() in order to cache the most of my site But, when I upload all my files, I have an apache timeout on the production-server and I have to restart the server again and undo the changes. I was looking for a fix, but I'm afraid I'm the only one I have this problem :S Has anyone ever had this problem?
