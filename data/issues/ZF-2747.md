### Description

Using 'attribs' for the form blows the action key. To get the form to generate properly, you have to move the action into the attribs array.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array(
        'action' => '/user/test',
        'method' => 'post',
        'elements' => array(
            'username' => 'text'
        )
    ));


Works. Form action is set in HTML.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array(
        'action' => '/user/test',
        'method' => 'post',
        'attribs' => array('id'=>'testid', 'class'=>'testclass'),
        'elements' => array(
            'username' => 'text'
        )
    ));


{color:red}_Doesn't Work. Form action is not set in HTML._{color}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array(
        'method' => 'post',
        'attribs' => array('action'=>'/user/test', 'id'=>'testid', 'class'=>
        'testclass'),
        'elements' => array(
            'username' => 'text'
        )
    ));


Works. Form action is set in HTML.
