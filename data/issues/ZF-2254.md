### Description

I expected to disable a button like: $this->formSubmit('name', 'value', array('disable' =>true);

That didn't work, it has to be done like $this->formSubmit('name', 'value', array('disabled' =>'disabled');

which is not 'inline' with the other form elements. Please add same disable style as with other form elements te keep consistency
