### Description

I'm searching a way to use Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http with Database or Ldap. It seems that I must made Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http\_Resolver.

What is not very logical is that Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http should not be an adapter but only a layer above Zend\_Auth\_Adapter objects. By this way it will be possible to use any of the existing adapters like Db, OpenId or Ldap.

I've tried to create Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http\_Resolver\_DbTable extending Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable. It's dirty and doesn't works because in my Db password are MD5 encoded so resolve Method can't return password properly

Matthew, I'm having a hard time seeing the issue that the reporter is having. Can you find a course of action on this one? Reporter: please provide more details and exactly how you intend to use HTTP authentication if possible.

I completely agree with the issue reporter on this. When I originally wrote the Digest adapter, I realized this problem. It's not a simple issue, however, due to the way the HTTP authentication process works. The most common DB-table based authentication designs store a username and password hash in the DB, yet that cannot work with HTTP authentication, since the password equality comparison cannot easily be done in an SQL Where clause. Digest authentication, in particular, must process the password hash along with several other variables in order to determine if the credentials are valid, so this requires the data to be returned to the adapter instead of the adapter sending the data to the DB in a query.

Really, HTTP authentication is just one authentication _strategy_, a peer to form-and-session based authentication. However, Zend\_Auth was designed as if forms based authentication were the only strategy. DbTable, Ldap, OpenId, etc. are all actually specific ways to carry out forms authentication. There are two levels here that aren't being acknowledged: 1) the authentication protocol between the server and client, and 2) the validation mechanism the server employs to check the credentials (which may involve communication with 3rd party servers).
