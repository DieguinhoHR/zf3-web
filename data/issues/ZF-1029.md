### Description

Zend::registry() becomes Zend\_Registry::get() Zend::register() becomes Zend\_Registry::set() Zend::initRegistry() becomes Zend\_Registry::setClassName() Zend::\_\_unsetRegistry() should become Zend\_Registry::\_unsetInstance() Zend::isRegistered() becomes Zend\_Registry::isRegistered()

Zend::dump() becomes Zend\_Debug::dump()

Zend::loadClass() becomes Zend\_Loader::loadClass() Zend::loadFile() becomes Zend\_Loader::loadFile() Zend::isReadable() becomes Zend\_Loader::isReadable()

Zend::VERSION becomes Zend\_Version::VERSION Zend::versionCompare() becomes Zend\_Version::versionCompare()

Zend::loadInterface() is deprecated and will not be propagated to a new file. Zend::exception() is deprecated and will not be propagated to a new file.

Make all methods in Zend.php proxy to their new equivalents if possible. For Zend Framework 0.9.0, all methods in Zend.php should generate an E\_USER\_NOTICE. In a subsequent release, the Zend.php file will be removed.

Unit tests and documentation should be updated to reflect the new classes.

Revision 3834 accomplishes a great deal of the above.

Still to do: - Make methods in Zend.php proxy to new methods. - Rewrite documentation.

Also todo:

- Unit tests for Zend\_Debug. There were never any unit tests for Zend::dump().

Revision 3844 adds documentation.

Revision 3845 adds a test for using object properties in the Zend\_Registry ArrayObject.

Revision 3900 includes the modifications to Zend.php to proxy to methods in the new classes.

All unit tests in /tests/ZendTest.php pass, even though they throw a bunch of E\_USER\_NOTICE errors because the methods are deprecated.

This completes the transition to the new refactored classes. Marking this issue resolved.
