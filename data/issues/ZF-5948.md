ZF-5948: Neverending loop in ->parse()
--------------------------------------

### Description

->setArguments() require an array as the only parameter, but setting it to something else i.e. a string or number will cause ->parse() to jump into a neverending loop at line 697: Warning: array\_shift(): The argument should be an array in \\includes\\ZendFramework-1.7.4\\library\\Zend\\Console\\Getopt.php on line 697

An error message both in ->setArguments() and ->parse() would be more apropriate :)

Attached patch to throw Zend\_Console\_Getopt\_Exception when not given an array as parameter. Another solution would be to transform the non-array value into an array and work with that. However, current documentation would suggest the Exception should be the expected behaviour.
