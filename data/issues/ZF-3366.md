This helper should include the fuzzy date output (or should that get included to Zend\_Date itself?) When I say fuzzy, I mean things like "A week ago" or "In two hours" etc.

\*) This is a notification for me to myself. It will be implemented as is \*) Zend\_Date does not support linguistic dates in that way \*) There is no way for Zend\_Date to recognise 'A week ago' in 130 languages.

Yeah, I haven't thought about parsing the fuzzy date back to an actual date object, it wouldn't make much sense as it wouldn't be very precise (for example, "a year ago"). Anyway, then it should get done for output only (that's where one would need it).

This, paired with the plural support for Zend\_Translate would mean you could do some very neat stuff with it. For example, if in ten days, you could say "In 9 days", but if in say twelve days, you say "In two weeks". I see this kind of date/time presentation being used more and more so the ZF users would benefit.

Closing as "needs proposal".

The related proposal has already been accepted for development within the incubator.
