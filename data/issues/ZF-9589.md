### Description

Hello,

I am using Zend\_Form, and I am trying to populate two form values before rendering the form. I have tried the setDefaults() and populate() methods, but it only sets the value for one input field. Here is the code:

$this->populate(array("email" => "Email Address", "password\_log" => "Password"));

I don't think this is a bug, it's probably just my fault, but I wanted to be sure just in case it wasn't.

Thanks!

James Sole

Im closing this as not an issue. Please direct support requests to IRC, or the mailing list.

The problem btw, is that password elements do not by default render populated.
