### Description

I've been testing and I cant seem to add the path correctly. I'm not allowed to adjust the php.ini, .htaccess gives me errors, php include paths are not working. I'm trying different versions of zend installed now to see if itll work

you can test it on <http://newshoole.com/checker.php> <--$clientLibraryPath = '/Zend/library'; <http://newshoole.com/checker2.php> <--$clientLibraryPath = '/home/newsho/public\_html/Zend/library/'; I have also tried adding and removing paths but they dont seem to work <http://newshoole.com/info.php> <-- my phpinfo (my php version is 5.2.17, is this why it doesnt work?)

Here was my call for help on another forum [http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php/â€¦](http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=2185984#post16268854)

I believe problem has been solved for now, downgraded to zend 1.6.2.

Can you tell me what the latest version of zend i could use? and please don't close ticket yet as I'm testing some stuff first if it really works

thanks

I think it'll be best if there is a table to download the requirements per versions released which would definitely help those like me that overlooked the version requirements. Thanks

Why doesnt this work? im just echoing something, anything now

 <?php $path = '/home/newsho/public\_html/Zend/library'; // Append the library path to existing paths $oldPath = set\_include\_path(get\_include\_path() . PATH\_SEPARATOR . $path); require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Gdata'); Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin'); Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Gdata\_Query'); $user = 'nightowl.hung@gmail.com'; $pass = 'peztilea'; $service = 'blogger'; $client = Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $service, null, Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::DEFAULT\_SOURCE, null, null, Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::CLIENTLOGIN\_URI, 'GOOGLE'); $gdClient = new Zend\_Gdata($client); function printAllBlogs() { $query = new Zend\_Gdata\_Query('<http://www.blogger.com/feeds/default/blogs>'); $feed = $gdClient->getFeed($query); printFeed($feed); } function printFeed($feed) { $i = 0; foreach($feed->entries as $entry) { echo $i ." ". $entry->title->text . "\\n"; $i++; } } echo $gdClient; ?>
