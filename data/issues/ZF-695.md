### Description

Zend::loadClass has this code:

 
       // autodiscover the path from the class name
       $path = str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $class);
       if ($dirs === null && $path != $class) {
           // use the autodiscovered path
           $dirs = dirname($path);
           $file = basename($path) . '.php';
       } else {
           $file = $class . '.php';
       }


as we see, $path is only used when $dirs are null. Thus, it is not necessary to calculate it when $dirs are not null - which can improve performance of such cases.
