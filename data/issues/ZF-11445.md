### Description

When you create a "like" constraint for select you do it somehow like this: $select->where('mycol LIKE ?', $where . '%'); But that way it's possible to "inject" more percent signs into the "where". I am not aware of any adapter method, that could be used to sanite the $where variable. The percent or question mark are obvious, but there might be other characters in other DBMSs.

Use case: Search database column for strings containing "100% sure". When used with syntax proposed above, it would match strings like "100kb is enough for everyone, that's for sure".

Is there any resolution to this issue? There should be a way to escape string to use it with "LIKE" in the adapter IMO. I also think this issue should be addressed in ZF2.

Here are my proposed APIs to start the discussion.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    or 


$select->where( 'mycol LIKE ?', $where /_quoted implicitly_/, Zend\_Db\_Adapter::ADD\_LIKE\_LEFT | ADD\_LIKE\_RIGHT | ADD\_LIKE\_BOTH | ADD\_LIKE\_NONE | ADD\_LIKE\_UNQUOTED );```
