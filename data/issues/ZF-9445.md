### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">$recoveryEmail->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_Db_RecordExists(
                array(
                    'table'=>'accounts',
                    'field'=>'email',
                    'messages' => array('noRecordFound' => 'Unknown email-address')
                )
            ));


This notation for adding a validator does not currently work, due to the constructor at present.

It works as expected.

You can simply try by initiating it manually:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $valid = new Zend_Validate_Db_RecordExists(
                array(
                    'table'=>'accounts',
                    'field'=>'email',
                    'messages' => array('noRecordFound' => 'Unknown email-address')
                ));
    
    var_dump($valid);


Object is created, table and field for DB are set. There is no failure within Zend\_Validate\_Db

Note that setting the messages by constructors is not supported within Zend\_Filter and Zend\_Validate. This is a feature of Zend\_Form.

You have to use the correct notation for Zend\_Form to have this working as expected... look into the manual for a description. Also the accepted options are noted within the manual. (Not complete but some are already described and the rest follows soon).
