### Description

In one of my projects I got a weird memory error using ZF. It ran out of memory when loading the Resource\_Frontcontroller by about 500MB. The solution was to rename the Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller to Zend\_Application\_Resource\_FrontController (including classname and filename).

When I searched the rest of ZF, I found that there was nowhere something like Frontcontroller. Except for some tests. While the resource FrontController was used all over the Application module.

Actually, we should be using all lowercase for the key names. The class _is_ called Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller, and the all lowercase naming is due to design decisions made to make matching of resource classes easier.

Thanks for your reply. I've looked further into this problem. I now see it's by design. When I changed it back, I still got the error.

When I changed something in the application.ini (no real changes), it suddenly worked.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Closing for reasons described above.
