ZF-568: Host header assumes HTTP
--------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2006-11-19T00:43:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:29.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

In determining the Host header, Zend\_Http\_Client assumes that HTTP (not HTTPS) is used when checking whether the default port is being used. This means that HTTPS requests to port 443 will have the header Host: hostname.domain.com:443 instead of Host: hostname.domain.com.

I have seen one instance ([https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS\_WEB/Sor/â€¦](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DPS_WEB/Sor/index.aspx?PageIndex=Search&SubmitType=Address)) where including :443 in the Host header confuses the server and it returns a 404 Not Found error. Although this is probably a bug in the web server (IIS) or web application, I am enclosing a patch that fixes this assumption and causes HTTPS requests to work with this site.
