### Description

Should the code generated by the command line tool be E\_STRICT compliant? When directly accessing the error action of the error controller (e.g. at example.com/error/error) it generates notices.

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\example.com\\application\\controllers\\ErrorController.php on line 10

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\example.com\\application\\controllers\\ErrorController.php on line 33

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\example.com\\application\\controllers\\ErrorController.php on line 36
