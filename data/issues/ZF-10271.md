ZF-10271: /images/note.png not found in document from subversion

### Description

/images/note.png not found in document from subversion

Seems like that the original manual includes some images, for example "/images/note.png". So if you open a topic, "26.4.A Zend\_Db\_Select" for example and scroll down to "26.4.3.3. Adding Expression Columns" you will see a missing image.

Appears to be an issue with zfchm project (which has since been resolved -- see [<http://code.google.com/p/zfchm/issues/detail?id=1>]). Not a ZF issue - closing.
