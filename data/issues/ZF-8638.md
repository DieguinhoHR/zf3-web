ZF-8638: Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_getParam() incorrectly assigns default value
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-26T19:42:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-02-07T18:58:44.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.7 (11/Jan/10)

### Description

If I have a parameter in the request object that has a value of boolean false (set by a route), and I pass in a default value, the default value will always be set if the parameter is boolean false. This is because the first part of the condition in Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_getParam() does an Equal comparison, when it should be doing an Identical comparison. Attached is a patch that correctly fixes the issue.

This patch changes the first part of the condition to check for whether or not to use the default value from using an Equal (==) comparison, to an Identical (===) comparison.
