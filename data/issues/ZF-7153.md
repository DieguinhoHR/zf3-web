### Description

The constructor of all filters and validators have to be reworked to use one single array as input.

This allows the usage of ini files without the need of keeping care of the order of the parameters. Additionally this unifies the usage for all validators and filters as it is then easily possible to extend them with new parameters without changing the API.

Example: new Zend\_Validate\_StringLength($min, $max);

Switched parameters makes problems when using INI or Zend\_Form.

New behaviour: new Zend\_Validate\_StringLength(array('min' => $min, 'max' => $max));

r18028 implements array and Zend\_Config support to all validators.

Added support also to all filters.

I looked into [http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/~raw,r=18028/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Validate/StringLength.php), because i had the idea of implementing an ConstraintsTemplate array into Zend\_Validate\_Abstract, which seemed problematic because of missing this Array Argument Support.

Now i saw just another possible improvement: Wouldn't it be more economical to implement the \_\_construct() method within Zend\_Validate\_Abstract, setting the values based on existance of an appropriate Setter Method in the individual Validators, and based on the StringLength example above move any Requirement Logic into the isValid() Method?

With Requirement Logic i mean this:

if (!array\_key\_exists('min', $options)) { $options['min'] = 0; }

That would also lead to an easy extensibility of Zend\_Validate\_Abstract like setting constraintTemplates through the config when instantiating any Validator and fetching them afterwards with a getConstraints() implemented in Zend\_Validate\_Abstract.

Please forgive if this was not the right place to put it in.
