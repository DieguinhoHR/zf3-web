### Description

Recent versions of the distributed/recommended php.ini file state that the superglobal variable order should be "GPCS" (i.e. variables\_order = "GPCS"). Since E is omitted, the $\_ENV superglobal is never populated and the ini file recommends always using getwnv() in preference to $\_ENV.

The Zend Tool zf.php file uses $\_ENV and getenv() erratically, sometimes checking for the existence of an environment var with getenv() and then assuming it's existence by referencing the $\_ENV array. All references in this file should use getenv().

I have attached the file with $\_ENV factored out in favor of getenv()
