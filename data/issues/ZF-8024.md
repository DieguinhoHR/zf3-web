### Description

Hello,

there is a new project for a specialized navigation in websites. You can look at <http://www.standard-navigation.org/>

I want this as a new feature in the Zend\_Navigation.

Is this the best place for it? Is it possible?

Of course I will help to implement it.

Thanks Andreas

Make a proposal for it, Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_StandardNavigation or something. It might not be for zf core, but could be a nice addition to ZendX.
