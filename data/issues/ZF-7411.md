### Description

When I parce date, it's allways parsed ad 1972/1971 when I am intering 2009....

I have found the error on lines 4452 function isDate

 
        if (self::isYearLeapYear($parsed['year'])) {
            $parsed['year'] = 1972;
        } else {
            $parsed['year'] = 1971;
        }


This code checkes that the date is LEAPYEAR and SET in the parsed date 1972/1971 !!!!!

Instead of issueing internal code lines you should mention what your problem is.

The isYearLeapYear method does not return it's internal values but only a boolean value so what ever is done internally, has no effect on your date.

Closing as not reproducable due to no response from reporter.
