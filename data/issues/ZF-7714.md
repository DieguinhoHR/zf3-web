### Description

In Poland, Italy, and some other European countries there pretty much wide use of Roman numerals for month numbers. That's I, II, III, IV, etc.

More info [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numbers) and in Zend\_Date format there's for example R still unused.

Thanks.

R has nothing to do with "roman script". R is used for RFC\_822.

Also according to ISO in italian and poland the month names are NOT written in roman script. It this is really incorrect than please add a issue at CLDR (unicode.org) who maintain the CLDR database where ZF relies to.

But you can archive such a behaviour by using Zend\_Measure, to convert the month number into roman notation.
