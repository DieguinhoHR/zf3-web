First, please provide more information how to demonstrate a problem.

The code you are referring to is taking a trim()'d string, then taking the hash value (32 characters from the end of the string, and comparing that to the provided values hashed. In all our tests this algorithm seems to work fine. If you can provide more information on how to demonstrate this issue, please reopen.

Thanks, Ralph
