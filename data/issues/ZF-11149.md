### Description

When using the new routing functionality in Zend\_Translate, routing breaks when using full locale strings (such as en\_GB or de\_DE)

This is due to line 754 $locale = substr($locale, 0, -strlen(strrchr($locale, '\_')));

This sets the $locale variable to automatically fall back to use a regionless locale. This was fine before, but now the routing code at line 773-778 relies on the original $locale value, and not the regionless locale.

To fix, I'd suggest modifying all variables named $locale inclusive of lines 754-766 to a different variable name, such as $regionlessLocale or maybe something shorter...

To test this bug, create a translation object,add two languages to it (using full locale strings) and set up routing between the two locales.
