### Description

I can't currently use the component and this may be contributing - not getting a final object at least. Anyway here's the error:

Warning: domdocument::domdocument() expects at least 1 parameter, 0 given in /Zend/Feed.php on line 195.

Taken from today's subversion but I understand it has been since January that it was updated.

An idiot apparently thought it was funny to enable the domxml extension in PHP5 while setting up a new development environment. This is actually a non-issue.
