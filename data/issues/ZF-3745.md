### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Part currently creates instances wit 'new self(...)', which means even if it's extended it still uses Zend\_Mail\_Part, because of early binding. '$classname = get\_class($this); new $classname(..)' can be used in PHP < 5.3 to avoid the problem.

One concern: The above suggestion will change the way Zend\_Mail\_Message works. It extends Zend\_Mail\_Part, and so with the above modification all parts accessed via a Zend\_Mail\_Message object will be returned as instances of Zend\_Mail\_Message and not Zend\_Mail\_Part. Probably not a big deal, but worth noting.

Might it be better to give Zend\_Mail\_Part something analogous to Zend\_Db\_Table's get/setRowClass methods? ie: Allow specifying the part class through the constructor and/or setter method, with the default value being equivalent to 'self'?

For consistency a method as Adam suggested would indeed be appreciated. This will be fixed in ZF2 however, so unless a patch is supplied this won't be given priority.

Tnx.
