### Description

I was doing this:

in my index.phtml $this->action('loginstate');

I was getting this in my apache's error.log

[Mon Sep 29 00:25:03 2008] [error] [client 190.17.78.104] PHP Warning: Missing argument 2 for Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action::action() in /home/macarse/www/library/Zend/View/Helper/Action.php on line 114 [Mon Sep 29 00:25:03 2008] [error] [client 190.17.78.104] PHP Notice: Undefined variable: controller in /home/macarse/www/library/Zend/View/Helper/Action.php on line 127 [Mon Sep 29 00:25:04 2008] [notice] child pid 14106 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)

Adding the two missing arguments fixed the issue.

Anyway, the second argument is a must-have argument, so you cant call that method with only one arg ...

I just tried this on my two machines and both times i just got the xdebug notice that says the second parameter is required and no segfaults.
