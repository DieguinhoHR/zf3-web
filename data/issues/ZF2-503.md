### Description

The getSqlStringForSqlObject() function returns a SQL statement where the integers for the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are quoted, which is not correct and MySQL returns an exception.

In the model/mapper

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = $this->getDbAdapter();
    $sql = new Sql($adapter);
        
    $select = $sql->select();
    $select->from($this->tableName);
    $select->limit(10);
    
    $selectString = $sql->getSqlStringForSqlObject($select);


$selectString returns

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT `rules_questions`.* FROM `rules_questions` LIMIT '10'


That seems to be an incorrect SQL statement, there should be no quotations around the LIMIT integer

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT `rules_questions`.* FROM `rules_questions` LIMIT 10


So when executing the query

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $results = $this->getDbAdapter()->query($selectString, $adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE);


MySQL returns this exception:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Message:
    SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax;
    check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use
    near ''10'' at line 1


The same thing happens when adding an OFFSET clause, the integer is incorrectly quoted.

i think ->execute() func can solve this

$statement = $sql->prepareStatementForSqlObject($select); $result = $statement->execute();
