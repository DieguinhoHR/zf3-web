Unit test added which confirms the issue. I could have guessed that this would already been tested but it wasn't.

Patch attached. Actually there was a unit test for this, but the test was invalid.

Just found out that this may break BC. I'm using this patch in my local copy of ZF and it broke one controller where I was counting on - although did not know it - that id param cannot be overridden. Maybe it should be possible to specify if default values can be overridden or not.

Kim -- can you please provide an example of a case where your change breaks behavior with the original version? Knowing that you experienced a break makes me reluctant to merge, and I'm not quite sure I have enough information to write up a test and get a modified patch in place.

Matthew - in my use case I have made a -router- route which tries to map unknown controller name to account name like this ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Check that controller name matches to account name. If true, create a route and dispatch that.
    
    ...Router_Route("$controller/:action/*", array( // $controller equals to account name
      'module' => 'default',
      'controller' => 'account',
      'action' => 'index',
      'id' => $account->id
    ));


Now if I have accounts named as 'foo' and 'bar' having ids 1 and 2, respectively, I can go to urls like "/foo/settings" and "/bar/settings". So these are proxies to "/account/settings/id/1" and "/account/settings/id/2". However, with the patch I provided - which allows wilcard params to be overridden - url "/foo/settings/id/2" will route to wrong account's settings action (bar's). Without the patch, default route values cannot be overridden and the id will always be right.

However, I think that commonly it is expected behavior that wildcard params can be overridden. But I would also like to have support for the above use case, so I suggest that the -router- route should have a new option something like "allowOverrideWildcardParams". This option would default true, but can be set false.

I'm sorry i didn't understood all comments (i'm french) The problem is solved ?

Nicolas - it is not solved in trunk as there is one use case which may introduce BC. But for your use case it should be safe to use the current patch (file Route.php.patch) as all unit tests pass with it.

Kim -- I'm assuming by "router", you mean the individual route itself, right? If so, let's make that change in trunk and review it for next month's release; please ping me by email when you've done a patch.

New patch attached, file ZF-11284.patch

i see it as named > defaults > wildcard.

If wildcard can override defaults then i can't be sure route i assemble is the one i actually needed. For example

.route = "something/:somevar/\*" .defaults.module = "somemodule" .defaults.controller = "somecontroller" .defaults.action = "someaction"

[http://example.com/something/123/â€¦](http://example.com/something/123/controller/othercontroller/action/delete)

this route will map to completely different controller/action/whatever.

Controller, action or module params are not touched. There is a test method which proves this.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // tests/Zend/Controller/Router/RouteTest.php
    
        public function testWildcardUrlVariablesOverwriting()
        {
            $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('archives/:year/:month/*', array('controller' => 'archive'));
            $values = $route->match('archives/2006/07/controller/test/year/10000/sort/author');
            $this->assertType('array', $values);
    
            $this->assertEquals('archive', $values['controller']);
            $this->assertEquals('2006', $values['year']);
            $this->assertEquals('07', $values['month']);
            $this->assertEquals('author', $values['sort']);
        }

Upd: I overlooked $\_allowOverrideWildcardData in ZF-11284.patch at first. Just ignore comment.

- - - - - -

We need reliable way to define variables and be sure they can't be overridden by wildcard. I see 2 ways:

1)create new improvement issue to add static variable definition, so order will be "path variable > static var > wildcard > defaults" so any variable can be defined as protected from wildcard override

2) (100% BC safe) add something like 'wildoverride' as addition to defaults

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    .route = "something/:neveroverridenbywildcard/*" 
    defaults.canoverride = "foo"
    defaults.cantoverride = "bar"
    defaults.neveroverridenbywildcard = "baz"
    wildoverride.canoverride = ""
    wildoverride.neveroverridenbywildcard = "" //always ignored


and then

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!isset($this->_wildcardData[$var])
        && (!isset($this->_defaults[$var]) || key_exists($var, $this->wildoverride))
        && !isset($values[$var])
    ) {
        //...

Edit: while sent this, I did not notice that Aleksey had edited his previous comment

Aleksey - I'm sorry but I do not follow. Did you check the patch, file ZF-11284.patch? It gives route a new flag to be set, which is allowOverrideWildcardData. The default value is false meaning that all routes works as before, so the patch is 100% BC safe. The use case here is to allow user to override url params which fall under \*. For example one could make a route like this ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
        'some/resource/*',
        array(
            'controller' => 'some',
            'action' => 'resource',
            'id' => 1,
        ),
        array(),
        null,
        null,
        true // new flag to allow override wildcard data, defaults to false
    );


Url some/resource/ will map to some/resource/id/1 and url some/resource/id/2 will map to some/resource/id/2, _not_ some/resource/id/1 - which would be the case if the last argument of the route had set to false.

I made a second unit test to make this more clear. Do we talk about the same thing/issue?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /** @var ZF-11284 */
        public function testWhileAllowingOverrideWildcardDataProtectNamedUrlData()
        {
            $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
                ':controller/:action/:foo/*',
                array(
                    'controller' => 'index',
                    'action' => 'index',
                    'foo' => 'barbapapa',
                ),
                array(),
                null,
                null,
                true // added new flag to allow override wildcard data
            );
            $values = $route->match('c/a/bar/controller/asd/action/asd/foo/asd');
    
            $this->assertEquals('c', $values['controller']);
            $this->assertEquals('a', $values['action']);
            $this->assertEquals('bar', $values['foo']);
        }
