ZF-12050: formSelect optgroup syntax broken
-------------------------------------------

### Description

When creating optgroups, the label is also used as part of the id:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $opt_id = ' id="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '-optgroup-'
            . $this->view->escape($opt_value) . '"';
    
    $list[] = '';


This breaks when the label contains spaces or html entities, e.g. "Waren & Fremdleistungen", both spaces and & are not allowed in ids.

Confirmed. Label value is not filtered before being used in the optgroup id.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1) Zend_View_Helper_FormSelectTest::testHtml4OptGroupLabelIsProperlySantiziedBeforeUseInId
    onetwo
    Failed asserting that  matches PCRE pattern "/]*?id="baz-optgroup-FooBAR"[^>]*?/".

Attached patch which corrects this behavior, according to id element rules found here: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/79022>

One thing to note is that the label value is escaped before being used in the id, which means & -> &amp;. Not sure if this is the intended behavior.
