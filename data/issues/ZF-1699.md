### Description

As reported at [http://snook.ca/archives/php/â€¦](http://snook.ca/archives/php/zend_framework_first_impressions/) :

{quote} The next thing I wanted to do was include a count on the page as to how many times a particular page was bookmarked. Unfortunately, this wasn't so easy. The Del.icio.us API describes has a way to get information on a post via the URL but, for some reason, this seemed to be left out of the ZF Del.icio.us class. Well, that sucked. Why apparently implement the all of the API but one method?

In any case, a little digging through the ZF code and it appeared that getting this going could still be straightforward. After some trial and error, it turned out to only be a couple lines of code: {quote}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $delicious = new Zend_Service_Delicious();
    $parms = array('hash'=> md5('<a href="http://example.com/archives/my/article_url/">http://example.com/archives/my/article_url/</a>'));
    $delicious_post_total = $delicious->makeRequest('feeds/json/url/data', $parms, 'json'); 


This should be made a public method of the Zend\_Service\_Delicious class -- I'd suggest something along the lines of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $total = $delicious->getPostTotal($url);

Jonathan reports that the method should actually be "getUrl()", as the actual service call returns a lot of information -- page title, notes, etc.

New method "getUrlDetails()" is in SVN trunk as of revision 5783.

{quote} be "getUrl()", as the actual service call returns a lot of information - page title, notes, etc. {quote}

Method returns array with four elements (url, url hash, top tags, total posts) as this is only data that del.icio.us returns for this kind of a request.

Changes have been merged to release-1.0 from the trunk, so changing fix version respectively.
