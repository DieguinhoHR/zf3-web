### Description

Zend\_Form should not remove the value 0 (zero) from the elements index of subforms.

When I try to create a subform with the following structure:

Zend\_Form removes the 0 (zero) from the attributes, thus leaving:

This is bad because some developers use the elements index to map objects to save in the database (e.g. Doctrine).

I couldn't reproduce this behaviour. Could you paste code you are using?

I've tried this example code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $subform = new Zend_Form_SubForm('subform');
    $subform->setElementsBelongTo('Foo[Bar][0]');
    
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Text(array('name' => 'baz'));
    $subform->addElement($element);


and it creates this result

 
    <pre class="highlight">


which is what you expect.

Sorry for the delay to response your comment

Follow the code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //personal info (name, email, dob, etc)
    $person = new Zend_Form;
    $person->setName('Person');
    $person->addElement('text', 'name');
    //contact form
    $contact = new Zend_Form_SubForm;
    for ($i = 0; $i <= 3; $i++) {
        //for each contact, i created a subform and append it to contact form
        $contactItem = new Zend_Form_SubForm;
        $contactItem->addElement('text', 'Bar');
        $contact->addSubForm($contactItem, $i);
    } 
    //so i added the contact form to the main form
    $person->addSubForm($contact, 'Contact');

Hmm.. Unfortunatelly I still can't reproduce this behovior :). The code you've provided is producing following html (I'm using ZF 1.10.7):

 
    <pre class="highlight">


So it seems correct.

Here is code I've used to check this: [<http://pastie.org/1095403>].
