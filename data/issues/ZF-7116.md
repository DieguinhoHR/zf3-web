### Description

Hi,

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract has a bunch of clearXXX() methods, but unfortunately no clearExceptions(). I've quickly subclassed it to add this method, but it would be nice to have it natively.

Let's say you have a specific error type, that when raised, is catched by error-handler as any other exception, and then error-handler (or any other plugin) redirect to a normal action/controller query. Well on next postDispatch loop event, your response will still be flagged has having an error and will again be handled by your error controller => recursivity, here we come!

This is just a situation among others were it would be useful. It's just that since a clear method already exists for almost all response properties, it would be nice to have it for exceptions too.

Regards, Remy
