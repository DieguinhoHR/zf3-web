### Description

i.e. Fieldset tag should not have method, action or enctype attributes. Don't you think?

$this->setAction('foo'); $this->setMethod(Zend\_Form::METHOD\_POST); $this->setAttrib('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');

$this->addDecorator(new Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset(array('id' => 'city\_form')));

generated html code:

<

fieldset id="city\_form" action="foo" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

 City object Info <

form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="foo" method="post">
