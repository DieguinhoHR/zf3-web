### Description

XmlRpc Server default method system.methodSignature gives wrong returnType value. It assigns every method default returnType "void".

I found out that the bug is not in XmlRpc, but in one of the core class. The problem is in a file Zend/Server/Abstract.php on the line #177.

Just change $prototype->setReturnType($this->\_fixType($prototype->getReturnType())); to $prototype->setReturnType($this->\_fixType($proto->getReturnType()));
