ZF-7765: Zend\_Rest\_Route maps actions, but not request methods.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Route maps REST actions to request, bases on "\_server" hidden field/X-HTTP-Method-Override, but not request methods. In that case, Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::isPut() and Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::isDelete() methods will return false.

Also, Zend\_Rest\_Route doesn't map a DELETE request method, so deleteAction() will never be invoked.

There are several solutions to solve this issue. First is a 'dirty' patch for Zend\_Rest\_Route, second patch is both for Zend\_Rest\_Route and Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http.

I can provide these patches.

I have not experienced this at all. I've been using Dojo's JsonRestStore with Zend\_Rest\_Route extensively, and all PUT and DELETE requests are routed accordingly; the X-HTTP-Method-Override header is not present in these requests, either, indicating that the routing is being done exclusively based on the actual request method (as it should).

Can you provide some example code that displays the issue?

Sorry, my bad - i just noticed DELETE-actions works fine, but only if uses with \_method field :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addElement('hidden', '_method', array(
                'value' => 'delete',
    ));


I also found Zend\_Form handles PUT/DELETE as GET methods. Is it a bug, or feature? Need i create a new ticket for this?

I mean, maybe will be better for Zend\_Form to check setted method and add a hidden '\_method' field automatically? In other case i don't see a point why PUT/DELETE methods were added to Zend\_Form.

I don't know much about how Zend\_Form works, but it's something we could/should investigate to make sure the two components work well together.

Luke, as i found since 1.9 in Zend\_Form was implemented new request methods, PUT and DELETE, for REST complatiblity. As i guess, when using this request methods, Zend\_Form should generate additional hidden field named '\_method' with related value for route matching. Also, Zend\_Form should always set POST request method in rendered HTML for REST method tunneling. In fact, Zend\_Form doesn't fulfill it.

I think it can be repaired in two ways: 1. Additional form decorator(no matter if it will work even without REST routing enabled). 2. Rewriting of Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Form.

So it sounds like this one is a problem in Zend\_Form, not Zend\_Rest\_Route ? Is there a Zend\_Form ticket to which I can associate this one, and then mark this one as duplicate?

thanks, -L

Good day, Luke. Thank you for help with ZF-7771. Yes, i created a ticket: ZF-7791.

Quick info : W3C's HTML 5 provide a text for adding PUT and DELETE capabilities to

<

form> elements More infos can be found here : [http://w3.org/TR/html5/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#form-submission-0)
