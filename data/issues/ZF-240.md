### Description

I have a small problem. If I drop my Front Controller into other than document root directory I have error, becose ZC\_Router is broken. For me Front Controller should be works in any directory, not in _/_ only. I created solution for this problem - I added lines in ZC\_Router. Before: $path = $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'];

After: $path = $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI']; if(strstr($path, $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'])) { $path = str\_replace($\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'], '', $path); } else { $path2 = substr($\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'], 0, strrpos($\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'], '/')); $path = str\_replace($path2, '', $path); }

That will works for paths: [http://framework.zend.com/others/index.php/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/others/index.php/controller/action) <http://framework.zend.com/others/controller/action>

Regards.

"Fixed in 0.1.5 with the new RewriteRouter moving to core. Old router will not allow this and will be replaced by the new router in a future release." -- Jayson MInard
