ZF-10590: Improper removal of the object in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In class Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard in method dispatch() (almost in the end - line 314) there's a call to delete object:

(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard) 313: // Destroy the page controller instance and reflection objects 314: $controller = null;

When creating object $controller link to this object stored in $this->\_helper->\_actionController

(Zend\_Controller\_Action) 132: $this->\_helper = new Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker($this);

So it appears that object contains a link to itself. And if we call "$controller = null;" it won't delete the link to object $this->\_helper->\_actionController. As a result, it doesn't call user controller's \_\_destruct. More precisely, it calls it, but only after script execution is finished.

You're misinterpreting the rationale. We're simply removing the objects from the scope of the method (which originally contained a loop).

You've deleted the link to the object. But the object stays in memory as there's another link to this object in itself $controller->\_helper->\_actionController

You'll note I said "scope of the method", not from memory.

When this code first existed, the action helper broker did not even exist. It's legacy code at best. Additionally, there's some who feel that the controllers should be kept within a registry of the dispatcher, so that if requested multiple times in the same request, the same instance will be retrieved.

Removing it from memory completely or keeping it in a registry at this point would break BC; as such, until ZF2, there's no reason to change the behavior as it currently is.
