return: /index.php

This is done because of AcceptPathInfo directive of Apache.

Persons who cant use mod\_rewrite can use this directive to jump over the index.php and make it part of the baseUrl. As an exemple : <http://somehost/route/from/here> works when mod\_rewrite is activated <http://somehost/indexbootstrap.php/route/from/here> works when mod\_rewrite is not activated but acceptPathInfo turned to on

{quote}This is done because of AcceptPathInfo directive of Apache.{quote} OK, but i do not have this directive, because it available in Apache 2.0.30 and later.

I have mod\_rewrite turned on and expect Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http::getBaseUrl() will return / if user requested <http://somehost/index.php> file.

Having discussed that with Matthew and others, for me it's not a bug, but let a Zend guy answer before closing the bug ticket

Closing based on user commentary.
