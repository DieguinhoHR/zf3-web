According to RFC 3986 (Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax), section 3.2.2 a trailing dot is perfectly valid.

A fix is created, together with a unittest. I will upload the patch as soon as my CLA is processed.

Thank you for the report and thanks for the patch Jacob. Added a unit test and applied to trunk in r23487, merged to 1.11 release branch in r23488.

Mark, I did have a test, but it seams it wasn't in the patch. I'll doublecheck next time. Thanks for creating one!

Re-opening issue to make it more likely someone with commit rights checks and applies the new patch.
