### Description

I have found an error in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract's \_dsn method. Input parameters should be filtered before converting to the DSN string.

This issue was found when I tried to use Zend\_Queue with PostgreSQL database (ZF-7827).

To resolve this issue we should add a list with available connection parameters to every Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_\* class and check parameters before assembly the DSN string.
