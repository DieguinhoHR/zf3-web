### Description

Error suppression works in a production environment, but my development environment does not suppress errors/notices and this problem still persists.

Please fix this, it should not use a deprecated function.

Thank you for your work!

Can you please specify where something is not working correctly? Example code or something similar would be very cool. :)

From looking at the original issue, I would think this used to occur in the \_fileGetContents() function of Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File. However, when looking in trunk as well as release-1.9, I saw no more use of get/set\_magic\_quotes\* or any checks regarding those functions.

So might be an old version of ZF.

Can you check the Zend\_Version class, there should be a version number for your ZF release.
