### Description

The localizationfiles in the resourcefolder of the ZF2 package are multiple files (Zend\_Validator.php, Zend\_Captcha.php). So i can use them only with different textDomains (in my case 'validator' and 'captcha').

To prevent setting the textdomain by each validatorelement i set the default translator and the default tranlatortextdomain by \\Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator($translator, 'validator');

But \\Zend\\Captcha\\AbstractAdapter is a subclass of \\Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator and uses the same Domain like AbstractValidator because there is no own implementation for setDefaultTranslator(). Is it possible to implement setDefaultTranslator() and the other static functions to support different domains for validators and Captcha? Or is there an other solution to load multiple languagefiles?

PS: Excuse my bad English :)
