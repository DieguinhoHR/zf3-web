-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

On line 92 of Zend\_Amf\_Request a deserializer is constructed.

Class name is wrongly capitalized and code fails on situation where require\_once calls have been commented out for performance and system is relying on lazy loading via autoloader on a case sensitive filesystem.

$this->\_deserializer = new Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_AMF0\_Deserializer($this->\_inputStream);

Should be:

$this->\_deserializer = new Zend\_Amf\_Parse\_Amf0\_Deserializer($this->\_inputStream);

Issue has been resolved in the trunk. I will make sure to migrate it to the 1.7 release branch
