ZF-6987: Zend\_Date::isDate() cannot parse dates which do not contain separators

### Description

// returns true, as expected $result = Zend\_Date::isDate('2009-01-01-01:02:03', 'yyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm:ss'); var\_dump($result);

// returns false - but shouldn't this also be 'true' ? $result = Zend\_Date::isDate('20090101-01:02:03', 'yyyyMMdd-HH:mm:ss'); var\_dump($result);

This seems to be caused by the way Zend\_Locale\_Format::\_parseDate() (which is called by Zend\_Date::isDate()) uses a regular expression to split the digits. A lack of non-digit separator means that in the "broken" case above, any digits that don't have a non-digit separator are assumed to be a part of the previous format token. So, the year is interpreted as "20090101" and not "2009" in the broken example.

This is a real pain for validating dates because the only solution seems to be to split the date first and add separator characters before validating.

If I'm not mistaken, the ISO 8601 spec allows both the format YYYY-MM-DD as well as YYYYMMDD - so shouldn't isDate() be capable of parsing these dates? See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601/â€¦](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates)

It is confusing because while the following does get returned as a valid date, I don't think it is validating the whole date due to the problem above:

// returns true - but probably isn't examining each date part as you'd think it would be $result = Zend\_Date::isDate('20090101', 'yyyyMMdd'); var\_dump($result);

At the very least, this should be made clear in the documentation that isDate is not capable of parsing dates which do not contain separators between each datepart.
