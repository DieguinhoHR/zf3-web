### Description

Nesting a call to Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action in a call to Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action will render the inner call twice, once before the outer call and once within it (as it should be).

In layout:

 <?php echo $this->action('get', 'sidebar'); ?> That renders a view script with the following code:

### Question?

 <?php echo $this->action('partner', 'email'); ?> 

 

The viewscript returned in <?php echo $this->action('partner', 'email'); ?> is displayed both above

<

div class="sidebar"> and within it.

If the viewscript contains the same thing, but does not echo the partner/email action (<?php $this->action('partner', 'email'); ?>), it still is rendered above

<

div class="sidebar">, but no longer inside it.

The latter scenario should not render it at all.

Assigning to Ralph and scheduling for next mini release; may be fixed in trunk already.

Adam - you have the same issue I reported in the linked bug report (2808). I've offered a fix but there are other issues to consider as well. but to fix your problem quickly see my comments.

adding $this->resetObjects();

in the  
 class Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action public function action($action, $controller, $module = null, array $params = array()) class Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action

just before return seems to solve this issue
