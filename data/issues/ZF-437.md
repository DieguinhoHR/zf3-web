ZF-437: Zend\_Cache\_Backend::setDirective(...) fatal error.
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-10-11T12:20:20.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.2.0 (29/Oct/06)

### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend::setDirective(...) does not do due diligence when logging is set to true and Zend\_Log has not been loaded or instantiated.

The correct behavior can currently be found in Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_setOption (line 178 of revision 1293?) see class\_exists exception.

This results in a fatal error being thrown. Later when Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php, line 309 attempts execution.

this is the script that should throw an exception instead of a fatal error

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?
    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . "./zf2/library/");
    require_once 'Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php';
    $zcbf = new Zend_Cache_Backend_File();
    $zcbf->setDirectives(array('logging' => true));
    $zcbf->remove('barbar');
    ?>
