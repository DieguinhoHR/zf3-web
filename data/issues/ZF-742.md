    <pre class="highlight">
    -        if ($part !== null or (!is_numeric($date))) {
    +        if (($part !== null && $part !== Zend_Date::TIMESTAMP) or (!is_numeric($date))) {


The patch also contains another minor tweak to remove a great deal of extra processing when constructing new Zend\_Date's from timestamps.
