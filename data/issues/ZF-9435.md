ZF-9435: Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Boostrap::getResourceLoader() calculates extra, invalid paths for Autoloader

### Description

If an application is using an empty appnamespace, the Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Boostrap::getResourceLoader() incorrectly adds the path to Zend/Application/Bootstrap to the autoloader, causing the application to have to scan extra directories when looking to map plugins, models, etc. Attached is a patch that changes the identical comparison to an equality comparison when testing the appnamespace to avoid the extra erroneous paths.

Downgrading to minor performance improvement

So now if I have application/plugins Plugin\_Example the autoloader will not find it, unless I'll add a resource loader to the loader's stack ? All my applications stopped working after this path.

@Jacek Register your plugin. [Look at the docs](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.application.available-resources.html#zend.application.available-resources.frontcontroller). (Example #5)

Hello Frank, thanks for your response. That's not a problem with plugin registration as it is already registered. It just doesnt know that Plugin\_ resides in /plugins.

I'm using default directory structure and all resources fail to load as Zend\_Application\_Module\_Autoloader pointing to my APPLICATION\_PATH is not initialized anymore. application/services Service\_ application/models Model\_ application/plugins Plugin\_ application/forms Form\_

Those are "application-wide" resources used in all modules. My default module resides in /modules/default and that is probably the problem here.

So if anyone out there is using such structure, and APPLICATION\_PATH/{model|form|etc...} to store their base classes or reusable components for other modules, after update to 1.12.1 it will stop working.

{

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function _initResourceLoader()
        {
            if($this->getResourceLoader() === null){
                $this->setResourceLoader(new Zend_Application_Module_Autoloader(array(
                    'namespace' => $this->getAppNamespace(),
                    'basePath'  => dirname(__FILE__),
                )));
            }
        }
    {

I use this too, simply to load "Form\_Foo" from "/application/forms/Foo.php". Now it breaks :(

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbuseCase">production]
    appNamespace = ;Zend_Application_Module_Autoloader
    </a>

If i delete that entry, everything works as intended, no resource loader is built. Haven't tested for modules tough.

I suspect the source code change was not need, maybe it's possible to reach the desired performance improvement with a more precise/explicit configuration and still have the [#AbuseCase to work with.

I like to reopen and revert this. To my understanding the feature worked as intended.
