ZF-11836: View Interface is missing getHelper method
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-10-21T09:18:58.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-22T14:18:01.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The getHelper method is used by Zend\_Form which just need a Zend\_View\_Interface as provided View. But the Zend\_View\_Interface does not contains such a method, so all the custom made view oriented on the interface are failing if using as a view for a form.

Any update on this issue ? It is in fact an error on the interface.
