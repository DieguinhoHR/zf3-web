Can you provide an example? It doesn't have to work, and even pseudocode would help us to understand your question a bit better.

Also, take a look at this page from [~rob]'s [ZF2TestApp](https://github.com/akrabat/ZF2TestApp): <http://zf2test.akrabat.com/view/multipleViewModels> If that is the type of functionality you are looking for, check out his source code for that page: \* Controller: [https://github.com/akrabat/ZF2TestApp/…](https://github.com/akrabat/ZF2TestApp/blob/master/module/Application/src/Application/Controller/ViewController.php#L64) \* Main View Script: [https://github.com/akrabat/ZF2TestApp/…](https://github.com/akrabat/ZF2TestApp/blob/master/module/Application/view/view/another-action.phtml)

Thanks Adam Lundrigan

Sorry for bad description. please see this code $result = new ViewModel(); $result->setTemplate('view/another-action');

$comment1 = new ViewModel(); $comment1->setTemplate('view/child-comments'); $result->addChild($comment1, 'child\_comments');

$comment2 = new ViewModel(); $comment2->setTemplate('view/child-comments'); $result->addChild($comment2, 'child\_comments');

in this example $comment1( in child\_comments capture ) replace with $comment2(in child\_comments capture ). But some time want to append to view model to one capture/

I would like to see this feature implemented too. I've been dealing with the same problem and haven't found a workaround for it.
