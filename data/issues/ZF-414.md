### Description

These methods will allow for easy retrieval of the way that the Zend\_Config instance was loaded without having to store it outside the class. This is particularly useful where a Zend\_Config object instance is stored and fetched using an application registry.

getSectionName() will return either a string or an array of string depending on how the Zend\_Config was loaded. If it was loaded using a single section name, then getSectionName() will return a string. If it was loaded using mutliple section names or null (all sections) then it will return an array.

areAllSectionsLoaded() will return a boolean to indicate if the entire ini file was loaded.

Best to do this one after multiple sections are loadable!
