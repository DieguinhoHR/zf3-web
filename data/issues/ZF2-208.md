If somebody has to do work on this any way, maybe it is worth considering using a query to LAST\_INSERT\_ID() on Mysql adapters by default and make use of PHP function "mysql\_insert\_id" configurable.

This would make "getLastGeneratedId()" BIGINT-tolerant by default.

Fixed in master, please try this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter->getDriver()->getLastGeneratedValue();
