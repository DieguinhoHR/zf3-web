Warning and code sample should be separated and styled.

This appears to be a manual issue. Reassigning to Wil

Re-categorizing. We will try to fix this issue as part of the manual rendering efforts that are underway.

I'd suggest closing this one. This does not seem to be happening anymore. I've tested under IE and FF 3.5

The new documentation standards (80 characters by line in programlisting) have effectively solved this issue.
