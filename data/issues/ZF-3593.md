ZF-3593: Zend\_Session::expireSessionCookie fails on initial session creation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-07T17:38:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-13T18:59:52.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.11.12 (22/Jun/12)

### Description

Zend\_Session::expireSessionCookie method will fail when it is called on the same page as a new session is created.

Example: a new user comes to my website, and I start a session using Zend\_Session::start(), there will be no $\_COOKIE[session\_name()], so this test will fail, if (isset($\_COOKIE[session\_name()])) { ... }

which leaves a case when after I have called Zend\_Session::expireSessionCookie, the user still has a session cookie!

I suggest to replace the if test w/ the following if (isset($\_COOKIE[session\_name()]) || self::$\_sessionStarted) { ... } which solved my issue

Why are you attempting to expire a session cookie on the first page visit?
