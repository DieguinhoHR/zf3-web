### Description

The Quick Start Tutorial appears to missing many steps. Here's my suggestion for revamping it:

Step (1): Setup and Configuration of the Zend Framework

 
     1)  Install Zend Framework using the Zend Server Community Edition (CE)
    
           a)  Download the Zend Server from here for your platform.
           b)  Update .profile on Mac OS X or .batchrc file if on Linux with the following:
    
     2)  If ones doesn't use Zend Server Community Edition (CE)
    
           a)  Download the framework from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://framework.zend.com/download/current">http://framework.zend.com/download/current</a>
           b)  Add the following to your .profile (Mac OS X) or .bashrc (Linux) or <some file> (Windows):
    
                Mac OS X and Linux Users:
    
                  export PATH=/path/to/zend/share/ZendFramework/bin:${PATH}
                  export ZEND_TOOL_INCLUDE_PATH_PREPEND=/path/to/library/Zend
    
                Windows Users:
    
                  add appropriate setup here for Windows configuration


Step (2): Creating our first project

 
      1)   Creating the application skeleton
    
             Mac OS X and Linux Users:
    
               zf.sh  create project quickstart
    
             Windows Users:
    
               zf.bat  create project quickstart
    
       2)   Explain the files generated by the command
    
       3)   Running our first application
    
             a)  Zend Server Users
    
                  Mac OS X and Linux Users
    
                    What are the exact steps for running an application?
    
                  Windows Users
    
                     What are the exact steps for running an application?
    
             b)   Non-Zend Server Users
    
                    Mac OS X and Linux Users
    
                      What are the exact steps for running an application?
    
                    Windows Users
    
                      What are the exact steps for running an application? 


In short, the installation and configuration of Zend Framework Quick Start should go into much better detail.
