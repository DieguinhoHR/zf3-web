### Description

It is mentioned in the bug 5956 [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5956>] that the problem with Zend Paginator while selecting UNION query is fixed in revision 16144 but i have checked out for the latest Trunck today but the problem persists.

We are still getting this crash: exception 'Zend\_Db\_Select\_Exception' with message 'No table has been specified for the FROM clause'

The code looks like below:

Lets say $select1 and $select2 are Zend\_Db\_Selects that give identical fields.

Then we do $select1 UNION $select2: $select = $db->select()->union(array($select1, $select2));

$paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select);

The above exception raises at this level i.e. 'Zend\_Db\_Select\_Exception' with message 'No table has been specified for the FROM clause'
