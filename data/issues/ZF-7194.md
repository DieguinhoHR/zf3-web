### Description

I had to read through the code, search for requireModule before I realized that _echo $this->dojo()_ cannot be called before calling the _$this->form->render()_ if the correct dojo.require() are to appear in the header. I would appreciate if this was clearly stated in the docs. This is obvious once one thinks of it but not always by default see Stackoverflow [question 1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3829609/zend-dojo-form-in-a-layout) and [question 2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2869435/zend-dojo-form-not-rendering-in-layout).

Currently in [zend.dojo.view.html](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.dojo.view.html): {quote} In our layout script, we'll then check to see if Dojo is enabled, and, if so, we'll do some more general configuration and assemble it:

...code...

At this point, you only need to ensure that your files are in the correct locations and that you've created the end point action for your FilteringSelect! {quote}

I suggest add before "At this point" a "Make sure that any widgets created in the the layout are created before the _echo $this->dojo()_ or the required modules etc won't be able to properly load".

Added a few suggestions to how the docs might be changed.
