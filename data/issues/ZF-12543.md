### Description

creation of files (or directories) are permit in the directory specified by php.ini directive "upload\_tmp\_dir" but write on directory is forbidden (rename, move, delete)

Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract use internal method \_isPathWriteable() to check if a file can be created in its method \_getTmpDir().

After tmpDir is defined, method setDestination() is called and it's simply a call to php function is\_writable that return false in our case (so exception is thrown)

Why not use the same method - \_isPathWriteable() which create a test file - to check if a file can be wrote in directory ?

context: zend framework: 1.12.0 (but seems exists in 1.12.3) php 5.4.0 os: windows server 2008
