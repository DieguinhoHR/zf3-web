Solved in SVN r17318 in trunk. It will be release at 1.9.1

Maybe a good idea to add/update the appropriate unittests?

Do you have nice idea to check difference of results whether lacks of [Zend\_Db\_Select::FOR\_UPDATE] ?

Sorry, I suck at unittests. For the moment I'm reopening this issue until there's someone who knows how to add tests for this (or someone who says it's impossible to add tests for this).

The 2nd comment (Satoru Yoshida - 30/Jul/09 07:17 PM) states the fix would be released with 1.9.1. I can confirm the bug is still present in 1.9.2.

Thanks confirm, Antonio. Sorry. I forgot to merge into 1.9 branch. :-( So, I change the Fix Version to Next Minor.

I just saw that 1.9.3 is tagged. Regarding the previous comment, will this fix be included in 2.0? Because it's not included in the 1.9.3 release.

Jeroen - Once merged to the 1.9 release branch, we can release it. Satoru -- if you could please merge it ASAP, we can include it in 1.9.4 in early October.

(BTW, next minor release will be 1.10, and is some months away; we have twice-monthly maintenance releases between minor releases.)

 

 

Posted by Jeroen van Dijk (neorey) on 2009-09-22T05:46:33.000+0000

Thanks for the heads up! And sorry for the misconception about minor-releases... of course 1.10 and not 2.0!

Hi, Jeroen and Matthew, I just merged into 1.9 branch at SVN r18384 from trunk 17318.

So we could see it solved in next mini :-)

Commit r18384 has another change that is not in accordance with this patch, Saturo can you comment on the diff?
