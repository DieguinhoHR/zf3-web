ZF-7100: Zend\_Paginator can raise a divide by 0 warning 
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-23T08:42:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-07T10:05:34.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If itemCountPerPage is set to 0 or setItemCountPerPage is not called, a divide by 0 warning may be raised.

This could be avoided by either setting some default item count per page, or throwing an exception if the \_calculatePageCount method is called without first setting a valid itemCountPerPage.

Throwing an exception should be prefered, as userland code could set the value to 0 if there is incorrect filtering. Relying on a php warning should not be correct however.

This problem can be resolved by not using \_itemCountPerPage in the Paginator, but calling getItemCountPerPage (which will return the default value if none is set).

This has been duplicated by ZF-7207 (<http://tinyurl.com/lqyqym>) and has now been resolved.
