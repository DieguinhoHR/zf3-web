### Description

When reflecting from an existing file using Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_File::fromReflectedFileName(), the code that previously existed gets distorted, in that tab and newline characters are duplicated.

Original:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($foo)
    {
        bar();
    }


Becomes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($foo)
    
    {
    
            bar();
    
    }


If Repeated becomes

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($foo)
    
    
    {
    
                bar();
    
    
    }


and so on...

Note however that new code (method) that is added is not affected by this, only the existing code gets mangled.

This issue was kind of bugging me, so I patched the CodeGenerator/Php/Method.php file with the patch included here
