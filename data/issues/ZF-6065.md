### Description

Hi,

I posted this message to the mailing list but got no feedback so I am going to proceed under the assumption that this is infact a real bone-fide bug! [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.zend.framewâ€¦](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.zend.framework.general/26198)

In Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url the reset parameter is documented as: "Whether or not to reset the route defaults with those provided".

I've always taken this to mean that if the route being assembled is the same as the one matched on the current request, do not use the values extracted from the current request when assembling if this argument is true.

Assuming I am correct, when I look at the assemble() method of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex it's clearly evident that the $reset parameter is completely ignored and $this->\_values is always used.

So under this logic, it is impossible to e.g. link to the same route as currently matched but with different values for some params, but leaving others to be filled in by their default values when said missing params were actually supplied in the currently matched route!

Phew, that last sentence was a hard one to follow, so I'll do an example.

Say I have a route:

new Zend\_Route\_Regex( 'foo(?:/([\\w-]+)(?:/([0-9]+))?)?', array('module' => 'blah', 'controller' => 'blah', 'action' => 'blah', 'arg1' => bar, 'arg2' => 1), array(1 => 'arg1', 2 => 'arg2') );

If the following URL is matched /foo/bar/42

And I use a view helper to create a new link on that page via: $this->url(array('arg1' => 'oink'), null, true);

Then I'd expect a route of: /foo/oink to be produced (because null will match the current route, and true says the current values should be ignored.

However this actually produces a route: /foo/oink/42

As the value matched in the current route is not reset as you would expect.

This is the same regardless of the $reset parameter so: $this->url(array('arg1' => 'oink'), null, false); will also produce the same result: /foo/oink/42

Here is a patch that causes the route to honour the $reset argument.

Is the regexp route the only one with this problem, or does it apply to other route types as well?

A quick look at the code seems to suggest that only Regex.php is affected.

Hostname and Module both use it and Chain passes it on, Static doesn't but that's expected.

I've not tested the above, just a quick glance at the code. I only personally use Regex in my app as we have fairly locked down routes and use forward() quite a lot and the forwarded locations often assume that the ACL checks have been done etc. so things like module routing (the default) are unsafe for me :)

I use this patch and it works for me. It's used in company-level projects.

Don't want to be noisy, but is it really should take 2 year to change from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $matchedValuesMapped  = $this->_getMappedValues($this->_values, true, false);


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $matchedValuesMapped  = $reset ? array() : $this->_getMappedValues($this->_values, true, false);


?

Yeah, I've been carrying this patch in my local copy since I reported it. Getting it committed would be one less hassle. Are you still around Ben, or should we try and reassign this bug?

This fix is especially necessary for any regular expressions that contain subpatterns that don't get used during assembly.

Consider this route...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute( 'admin_client', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex(
    
        // route
        'admin/client/(\d+)(/(view|edit|delete))?',
    
        // defaults
        array(
            'module'     => 'admin',
            'controller' => 'clients',
            'action'     => 'view'
        ),
    
        // subpattern map
        array(
            1 => 'id',
            3 => 'action'
        ),
    
        // reverse
        'admin/client/%d/%s'
    ) );


If the user has navigated to /admin/client/123/edit, the matched values are as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "id"     => "123"
    2        => "/edit"
    "action" => "edit"


Now, if we try to assemble a URL based on this route...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->getHelper( 'Url' )->url( array( 'id' => 123, 'action' => 'view' ), 'admin_client', true );
    $this->_helper->getHelper( 'Url' )->url( array( 'id' => 123, 'action' => 'delete' ), 'admin_client', true );


...these both result in /admin/client/123/%2Fedit.

In this situation, without this fix, the action key is essentially ignored and the second matched subpattern ("/edit") is encoded and inserted, resulting in an incorrect URL.

_upvote_ This needs to be fixed as it makes regex-assembly completely useless.
