Now new Patches with no tabs instead of whitespaces, sorry

Please dont change the files over and over again. This makes it impossible to integrate them.

Better to patch when you're finished.

I'm deeply sorry, i wasn't quite sure wether your already integrated them, but i didn't want to offend the guidelines. Only two files were changed again. The next patches will be more complete, sorry.
