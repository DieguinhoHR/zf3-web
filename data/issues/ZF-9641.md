### Description

It would be great to direct support for the Dojo BusyButton, e.g. something like Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_BusyButton()

I too wanted this type of functionality so I looked at Zend's Dojo Button Form and View helpers and figured it out. Give it a try...

Find your library/Zend installation folder and from there:

find Dojo/Form/Element and create a file called BusyButton.php -> Source -> <http://pastebin.com/zpRgCidE> find Dojo/View/Helper and create a file called BusyButton.php -> Source -> <http://pastebin.com/VjJ8MuTd>

Now you can create a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_BusyButton() and the dijitparam options work as well.
