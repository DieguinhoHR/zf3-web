### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Server::\_\_handleStruct() doesn't currently recurse; thus, if a value is a non-string type, it will not appropriately create the XML.

Looking at the code I have the following question: What happens if the $result of a function is SimpleXMLElement or DomDocument or DomNode object?

If the result is a native XML object, we simply "render" said object and it is considered the REST response in its entirety - that is, no XML is added at all.

If I want to return SimpleXMLElement as a result of a function called via REST because it is easier for me instead of transferring it to associative array, the handle function will echo it straight and will not parse it as struct echoing the right result.

So it is better to know when exactly the result is comming from the function and find a way to avoid those ifs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($result instanceof SimpleXMLElement) {
        echo $result->asXML();
    } elseif ($result instanceof DOMDocument) {
        echo $result->saveXML();
    } elseif ($result instanceof DOMNode) {
        echo $result->ownerDocument->saveXML($result);
    } elseif (is_array($result) || is_object($result)) {
        echo $this->_handleStruct($result);
    } else {
        echo $this->_handleScalar($result);
    }

I am almost ready with a patch for the structs but I can not find what the xml output should look like. Is there some guideline for that?

Here is a patch, it works the way the Zend\_Rest\_Client expects
