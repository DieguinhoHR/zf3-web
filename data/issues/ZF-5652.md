### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = new Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http(array('ignoreNoFile' => true));
    $adapter->setDestination(Zend_Registry::get('config')->files)
    $adapter->addFilter('Rename', array('target' => Zend_Registry::get('config')->files.'note_'.$id,'overwrite' => true), 'note')
        ->addFilter('Rename', array('target' => Zend_Registry::get('config')->files.'terms_'.$id,'overwrite' => true), 'terms');


There is a note in manual Note that even though setting the same filter multiple times is allowed, doing so can lead to issues when using different options for the same filter.

It is a bug you cant add the same filter or validator diffrebt files with diffrent options , you cant manpulate multiple files with this

As you mentioned it is clearly described in the manual. So it is not a bug, it's a feature improvement.

And it duplicates an existing issue ZF-5126 where this improvement is described.
