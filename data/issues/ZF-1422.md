### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    date_default_timezone_set('Europe/London');
    
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->setWeekday(7);
    echo $date->getArpa(), PHP_EOL;  
    //Mon, 28 May 07 16:02:11 +0100  - Should be Sunday 27th


also the docblock states: "Specifying a weekday integer lower then 1, or greater than 7 will result in adding or subtracting the relevant number of weekdays to the current date of $this"

but

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date->setWeekday(0);
    //Zend_Date_Exception: invalid date (0) operand, weekday expected in /home/sites/library/Zend/Date.php on line 1406

Fixed the problem with WEEKDAY\_DIGIT within SVN 3902

Whoever wrote the API Docblock was wrong... weekday was never intend to support more than the actual week... for this purpose setDay should be used. This is also corrected.
