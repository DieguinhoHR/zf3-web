ZF-9814: Zend\_Db\_Table doesn't scale to i5/OS
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-05-06T09:23:05.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-10-21T11:41:42.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The query in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2::describeTable() for i5/OS runs very slow. Though we have over 20 million distinct column names on the machine I'm using. That's not uncommon for IBM i servers since they are so (overly?) database-integrated.

I'm closing this as not an issue. To prevent the describe table query being needed repeatedly, you may either use a meta-data cache, or hardcode the columns for each table into your Zend\_Db\_Table definition.

I was able to improve performance significantly by removing the 4 calls to the scalar function UPPER() and the use of SELECT DISTINCT.

Unfortunately, this loses case-folding (case-insensitive) nature of Zend\_Db\_Table, since SQL is case-insensitive with identifiers. Seems ok as long as we enforce case-sensitivity in our code and database guidelines. We'd rather leverage Zend\_Db\_Table than not.

I'll inline the attached patch below:

        for AS/400 machines to have distinct columns numbering in the tens
        of millions.

Thanks for the quick reply. I'm not sure the caching would work because I should have said "never returns" instead of "very slow". So that really only leaves the option of hardcoding the meta data.

Could we keep this issue open to see if other people have the issue as well? It might take awhile. Those of us writing PHP for the i are likely few and far between. Thanks.

Metadata caching does work for me on i5. To reply to Aaron's comment about his script never returning, he may need to allow a larger timeout value in the script to allow time for the cache to be written (the first time through).

Even though metadata caching for Zend\_Db\_Table does work for me on i5, and speeds up subsequent queries, I will avoid Zend\_Db\_Table when I can. I always fear that a real user will be the one to experience that slow first time through, as the cache is being written, causing a time-out for the unlucky user. I know that I can carefully make sure the cache is there before users hit the site, but I'd rather avoid even the possibility if I can.

That said, this technique does work, but if you use it on a production site, make sure all cached metadata is there before any users arrive.

With Aaron proposed "fix" my queries went from ~85sec to < 2sec

I also added caching in my boostrap and now queries are almost instantaneous.
