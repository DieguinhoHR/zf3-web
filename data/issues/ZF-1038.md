### Description

The methods, insert, update, and delete in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract do not quote table or column identifiers or support Zend\_Db\_Expr as values.

This makes the usefulness of these methods limited to very simple cases only, and potentially unsafe if the user assumes they work in a similar manner to methods of Zend\_Db\_Select.

I propose that the table name and columns are quoted using quoteIdentifier(), and allow values supplied to insert()/update() to be Zend\_Db\_Expr.

I've already implemented this and can commit if there are no objections.

Yes I agree, this has been intended for some time. Now that the quoteIdentifer() method splits on '.' this will not conflict with people's use of schema.table, etc.

It will benefit Zend\_Db\_Table implicitly because that class uses the adapter's insert/update/delete method.

I'll assign this issue to you and you can implement the change. Please make sure the unit tests continue to work, and let's talk about new unit tests that would be necessary to validate this change.

Please do not try to apply any logic to the plain query() method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Just apply quoting logic to the SQL generated within the insert()/update()/delete() methods.

This may also fix the following issues: ZF-139, ZF-627, ZF-956.
