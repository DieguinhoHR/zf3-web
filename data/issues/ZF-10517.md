### Description

There's a small bug in Zend\_Filter\_Word\_SeparatorToCamelCase class... When working with strings which contain unicode characters, unexpected results will occur. For example, if you have this string as a input value: _test šuma_, expected result would be _TestŠuma_, but _Testšuma_ is returned instead! That's because strtoupper() function is utilized instead of mb\_strtoupper(), for making that next-to-separator character upper-cased. Here's a part of the code which is problematic:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //... rest of the code
    if (self::isUnicodeSupportEnabled()) {
        parent::setMatchPattern(array('#('.$pregQuotedSeparator.')(\p{L}{1})#e','#(^\p{Ll}{1})#e'));
        parent::setReplacement(array("strtoupper('\\2')","strtoupper('\\1')"));
    }
    //... rest of the code


So, those strtoupper() calls should be replaced with mb\_strtoupper(), but that might cause some problems as mbstring is not default PHP extension, meaning that it is not enabled by default.

I've found this bug in ZF v1.10.8, so i believe it exists in previous releases, too.
