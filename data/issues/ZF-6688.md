### Description

Zend\_Validate doesn't extend Zend\_Validate\_Abstract, so for example this [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.html#zend.validate.introduction.translation) won't work.

As you can read in the manual, the translation is done by the validator itself. The container class has no connection to the validators (no callback) so it can not affect it.

Change from bug to improvement as the manual is correct and Zend\_Validate itself is no validator.

Abstract is the base class for validators and not for the container class.

I would argue that Zend\_Validate should not extend Zend\_Validate\_Abstract, as it is meant for creating validation chains and does not offer any concrete validation of its own.

I looked again into this issue.

Zend\_Validate itself does not validate itself. It is a container for validation where you can attach concrete validators.

As translation must be done by the validator itself (think of values which are integrated into the translated message), there is no need of translation for Zend\_Validate itself.

When you need translation for multiple validators set default translation for the abstract class or one of the used validators.

There is no change if you are using validation chain (isValid) or static validation (is). For both you have to attach a concrete validator.

Therefor closing this issue as won't fix. When you are missing a concrete feature feel free to add a new issue describing what's missing.
