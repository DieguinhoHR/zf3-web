ZF2-321: Label are not well-formed

### Description

If we are using the method explained in the documentation :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
            $company = $form->get('company');
            echo $formLabel->openTag($company) . $company->getAttribute('label');
            echo $this->formInput($company);
            echo $this->formElementErrors($company);
            echo $formLabel->closeTag();
        ?>


This generates the following HTML :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    "Nom de l'entreprise"
    


However it appears that this syntax for implicit label is not working, and clicking on the text doesn't make the input field active. It looks like when implicit labels are used (input inside label), the for attribute has to be removed.

Actually... you can simply do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $formLabel->openTag()


to create an empty label tag. If you want to provide attributes -- say, a class, you can provide an array of them:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $formLabel->openTag(array('class' => 'text-input'))


or:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $formLabel->openTag($element->getAttributes()) // probably not a great idea


I'll update the docs to use the empty tag notation.
