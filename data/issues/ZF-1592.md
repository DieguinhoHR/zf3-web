### Description

The unit tests for Gdata\_Calendar\_Extension classes currently only check to make sure that _empty_ instances have no extension attributes or elements. They should also check to make sure that normal instances (created using the existing element sample data files) have no extension attributes or elements.

Fixed in my build for tests in tests/Zend/Gdata/Calender.

Waiting for ZF-1593 to be resolved so this fix can be applied to tests in tests/Zend/Gdata.
