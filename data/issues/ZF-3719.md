### Description

Instances of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select do not work with Zend\_Paginator unless you specify a from clause (which is redundant for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select).

 <?php // Does not work $table = new MyTable(); $select = $table->select(); $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select); // Throws exception "No table has been specified for the FROM clause" // This works $table = new MyTable(); $select = $table->select() ->from($table); // Required by Zend\_Paginator $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select); // Works ?>

Paginate can't use a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select until that object knows which table its supposed to use. This is actually a duplicate of [](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3239)<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3239>.

=Doesn't work= $player = new Player(); $select = $player->select()->order('lastname DESC'); //object still doesn't know what table its going to use $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select);

=Works= $player = new Player(); $select = $player->select()->order('lastname DESC'); $select->\_\_toString(); //hack to force the object to set its table! $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select);

Since 1.9 there has been a feature in place that allowed select() to be called on a table with that will load the from part into the object.

Please see [here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.qry.rows.set.refine.example), and the api doc [here](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Db/Table/Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.html#methodselect)

I think it might fix this problem.
