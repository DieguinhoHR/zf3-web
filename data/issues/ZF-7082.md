ZF-7082: Zend\_Search\_Lucene::create() requires an absolute path
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-22T04:06:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:40.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

See: <http://issues.ez.no/IssueView.php?Id=15085>:

Pass a relative path to Zend\_Search\_Lucene::create(), which is the location of the Lucene index. During shutdown the destructor of a class in Zend Lucene will try to write out the index if it was modified. Since PHP resets the current working directory to / on some SAPIs (e.g. apache) writing the index will fail because the relative path now points to a different location. Thus Zend Lucene throws an Exception without a stack frame because it took place during shutdown.

This is more of a question back at you, but would it make sense to say that since you are using relative patche, one might also consider using chdir() in your project to point to your project or application directory (basically the root of what you consider to be the base directory?)

Is current working directory something that is honored in all file access functions in PHP regardless of SAPI?
