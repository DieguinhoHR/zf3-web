### Description

Currently, when adding Editor plugins via the addPlugin() method of Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor, you have to manually do the dojo()->requireModule() statements that correspond to the plugin module. In most cases, the plugin will correspond to dijit.\_editor.plugins., and thus we can generate the dojo.require statement automatically.

However, most plugins are builtin in the editor (such as bold, italic, etc.), and does not require a dojo.require call; unfortunately the kick-ass buttons like LinkDialog are implemented as external plugins. I'll try to write a patch today.

This is a patch for Zend\_Dojo as included in 1.7.5. Beautiful editor commands included: createLink, fontName, fontSize, formatBlock, foreColor, hiliteColor. Specify it in plugins to include in editor: $this->addElement('Editor', 'richtext', array( plugins => array('bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'createLink', 'foreColor', 'hiliteColor') )); Hope to see this in next minor version (1.7.6 I think).

Patch looks good -- but if you could also provide unit tests, it will make it that much easier for me to apply. :)

BTW, since it adds new functionality, it cannot be released until the next minor release, 1.8.0 (1.7.6 would be the next _mini_ release, and is happening on Monday).

Patch for EditorTest.php that make it fail in 1.7.5 and not fail in 1.7.5 after applying zf-4461.patch. Good.. 1.8 will be fine.. :)

New patch against 1.8 that adds also insertImage plugin. I recommend the inclusion in this branch.

Patch applied against trunk and 1.9 release branch; I added a unit test to verify the behavior as well.
