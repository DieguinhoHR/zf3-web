### Description

The demo code for Zend\_Gdata\_Blogger needs to be updated to explicitly specify a GOOGLE account type instead of a HOSTED\_OR\_GOOGLE account type during authentication.

Users who have a Google Apps account will be unable to authenticate to Blogger using the demo until this is fixed.
