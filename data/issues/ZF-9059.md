You need to modify your error handler to do several things. First, register it for E\_WARNING and above only. Second, do some filtering on your error messages to look for errors in Zend/Loader.php.

We use fopen() for checking if a file is readable as it allows us to search on the include\_path without manually iterating over it; this is a more performant operation. Unfortunately, it also means we need to suppress warnings on fopen() in the case it cannot find the file so that we can return a boolean value and ensure no warnings are emitted when display\_errors is enabled.
