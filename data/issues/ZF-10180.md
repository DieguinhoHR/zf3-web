ZF-10180: Add Default Page Range As Static Property
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-07-19T07:58:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-07-20T10:28:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): 
 Reporter:  James Stuart (jstuart)  Assignee:  Ramon Henrique Ornelas (ramon)  Tags: - Zend\_Paginator
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-9174](/issues/browse/ZF-9174)
 
 Attachments: - [paginator.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/13221/paginator.patch)
 
### Description

It would be helpful to have default page range be available as a static property on Zend\_Paginator. There is already a static property for default item count per page. At the moment, to maintain consistent pagination controls, the page range must be set on each individual instance of Zend\_Pagintator.

Patch against 1.10.6 to follow.
