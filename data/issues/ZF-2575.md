### Description

Bug posted by Vladas Diržys on public mailing list.

{quote} I think there is an error in documentation.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.cookies.html)

Example 17.22. and forward uses: $cookie = Zend\_Http\_Client('foo=two+words; ....);

but it should be: $cookie = Zend\_Http\_Cookie('foo=two+words; ....); {quote}

I suppose this is not the only one error.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cookie = Zend_Http_Client('foo=two+words; domain=.example.com; path=/somedir; secure;');


should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cookie = Zend_Http_Client::fromString('foo=two+words; domain=.example.com; path=/somedir; secure;');


and the same for the other examples where the cookie is created directly from the raw header.

I attach a patch for both typo and ::fromString issues.

Hi Thomas, I'm able to do this (I have SVN access and HTTP Cookies is a field I have enough knowledge to feel comfortable to made a change), I just wanted to take some time because I created the patch at office in a while and I wanted to double check it at home since it was a change to the main manual. :)
