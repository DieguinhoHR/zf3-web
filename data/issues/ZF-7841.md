### Description

Mail sent with Zend\_Mail shows up as sent to undisclosed-recipients, if Zend\_Mail method addTo($email, $name) is fed with empty $name or $name equals $email.

I have changed the function \_formatAddress in Zend\_Mail class to resolve this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _formatAddress($email, $name)
        {
            if ($name && $name!='') { 
                    $encodedName = $this->_encodeHeader($name);
            } else {
                    $name = $email;
                    $encodedName = $this->_encodeHeader($email);
            }
            if ($encodedName === $name && strpos($name, ',') !== false) {
                  $format = '"%s" <%s>';
            } else {
                    $format = '%s <%s>';
            }
            return sprintf($format, $encodedName, $email);
         
           
        }

I think your mail client may not follow RFC sadly.

The <%s> part is not required when the name is not specified or the name is equal to the address.
