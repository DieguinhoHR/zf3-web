### Description

hi

if you want to get the mail adress from a sender you only get the name but not the email ->getHeader('from');  
 delivers only the name from a receiving email and not the email adress!

The getHeader() method returns the header field as it appears in the original mail message.

This should be in one of two formats: "email@domain.com" or "Joe Bloggs [email@domain.com](mailto:email@domain.com)".

If you directly output the latter (name ) as HTML, the email address won't be visible since browsers interpret it as a tag.

In short, not a bug.
