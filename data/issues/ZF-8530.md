### Description

Zend Tool could easily integrate with PHPUnit for Project based testing. Currently zf create project creates some testing related resources, but they are not used.

1. Remove application/ and library/ distinction they dont pair with how PHPUnit works
2. Add a folder tests in each module, i.e. "modules/blog/tests", "modules/guestbook/tests".
3. Add two phpunit.xml one called unittest.xml, one functional.xml in the APP\_ROOT/tests/ mainfolder, they both configure bootstrapFile="" a specific unit-test bootstrap file.
4. Add a AllFunctionalTests TestSuite in APP\_ROOT/tests which detects all tests in folders and subfolders of all module tests/ folders (functionality is in phpunit already via Glob or something.)
5. Add a AllTests File which includes the AllFunctionalTests
6. Add a Bootstrap File that somehow gathers all autoloader specific resources (is that possible Matthew?!)

Big advantages: \* Functional tests reside in the module they belong too, yet they are aggregated by a specific TestSuite mechanism. \* We use PHPUnit functionality to gather the unittests, so we don't need to rely on our own additional mechanism (KISS!)

The following commands are now available:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    zf run test
    zf run test.(functional|unit) 
    zf create test.functional
