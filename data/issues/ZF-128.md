### Description

On the page <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Home>, tab "Project Summary", click anywhere on the green histogram bar. This will yield a Java error.

It also displays a bunch of information that could be useful to less innocent people.

This is a bug in JIRA, reported at <http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-10499>

It is reportedly fixed in JIRA 3.6.3. We are currently running JIRA 3.6.2. When we upgrade next, this issue should be resolved for us.

This is not an issue with Zend Framework.
