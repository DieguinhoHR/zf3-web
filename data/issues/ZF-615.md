### Description

Say I want to dispatch a request to ExampleController::whateverAction() from the bootstrap.

I request this page: <http://localhost/>

Here is the relevant code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();
    $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $controller->setControllerDirectory($controllerDirectory)
               ->setBaseUrl('/')
               ->setRouter($router);
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http();
    $request->setControllerName('example')
            ->setActionName('whatever');
    $controller->dispatch($request);


I would expect that the code in whateverAction() is called, but both RewriteRouter and Router ignore this. RewriteRouter sends the request to IndexController::indexAction() instead, while Router fails to send it anywhere.

It seems to me that if the controller has been set via setControllerName() then they should treat that as gospel and ignore whatever the current URI happens to be, unless the controller doesn't exist of course. It should then look for an action name set via setActionName() and use the default if one doesn't exist.

Now, this works in both Router and RewriteRouter if I slightly change the code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http('<a href="http://localhost/example/whatever">http://localhost/example/whatever</a>');


Because Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http uses Zend\_Uri to parse the URI, it requires a full URI ('http://...') instead of just '/example/whatever'. This is a hassle if you don't want to pass in $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] every time.

I should also point out that Router and RewriteRouter handle a subsequent $controller->dispatch() call differently. Router acts as if a blank Request object has been set, while RewriteRouter acts as one might expect, dispatching the same request twice.

Request\_Http is a holder for user submitted values (POST, GET, etc). So the setControllerName and setActionName works like normal parameters passed thru the URL - these are setting the values for the controller and action whatever the controller and action keys (names) are (with defaults being 'controller' and 'action'). You probably don't want you users to be able to override the router by specifically crafted URIs like:

[http://localhost/archive/2006/â€¦](http://localhost/archive/2006?controller=bogus&action=other)

With a route of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Z_C_R_Route('archive/:year', 
       array('controller' => 'archive', 'action' => 'show'));


Or even with a basic router.

Assigning to Matthew, lead on Zend\_Controller family.

A developer programmatically setting the controller and action doesn't mean that visitors should be able to override the controller and action, though. The order of precedence in Request\_Http is programmatically set values -> GET -> POST. It seems that it would just be a matter of checking if values are already set, and if not, parse the route instead like it normally does.

This weekend I began working on (and largely finished) a request-based scheduler, and requests are added to tasks by directly instantiating and populating Request objects (HTTP, of course, but it needs to work as CLI as well). This API may change at some point (I want it to be as flexible as possible), but this change makes it easier to manually create Request objects and gives them a common API for setting controllers and actions if in the future there's a Request\_Cli.

I've fixed the basic router, Zend\_Controller\_Router to do the right thing here -- the problem was that it was setting the controller with an empty value, due to the fact that the explode was returning an empty string.

As for the RewriteRouter, I've looked at it, and I have to side with Martel on this one. The default route in the RewriteRouter sets defaults for the index and action that should be used if no matches are found. If you want to change that, try this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_http();
    $request->setControllerName('example')
            ->setActionName('whatever');
    
    $router = new Zend_Controller_RewriteRouter();
    $router->removeDefaultRoutes();
    $router->addRoute('default', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(':controller/:action'));


The above works exactly as you request.

Of course, it didn't occur to me that RewriteRouter was only for HTTP requests, so it might be enough that this is changed in Zend\_Controller\_Router. That would allow a Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Cli object to work correctly in multi-controller CLI applications, since controller and action names would have to be manually set.

To be more clear about what I am trying to do, say you are doing the following in the bootstrap:

1. Do normal bootstrap-related things (importing configuration settings, setting up database connections, etc.)
2. Dispatch several different 'maintenance' requests (for example, pruning old message board threads in a database)
3. Dispatch main request (i.e., the visitor's request)

Now, obviously #2 would be bad if not for the fact that it is governed by scheduling rules (e.g., only do this once a month at 3am).

In the scheduler itself, it could set the original router to a variable, update the controller router to the default, dispatch its requests, then change the controller router back to the one originally set.

That seems like a good solution. Thanks, Matthew.

Actually it would be better to define this route as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router->addRoute('default', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(':controller/:action/*'), array('action' => 'index'));


Without a default for the action it would be matched only with both controller and action are set in the URL. And URL of "http://localhost/archive/" would result in IndexController::indexAction since RewriteRouter skips the route and dispatcher sets defaults to index/index.

Default action should probably be read from the dispatcher's getDefaultAction() but that's another story.

Martel -- I had the same thought last night about the rewrite router default route, only I don't think we even need to set a default for the action, as that 's handled in the dispatcher. I'll update it later.

RewriteRouter default route updated in revision 2110, resolving issue.

Matthew, I have added a test case for the issue I'm talking about - testDefaultRouteMatchedWithControllerOnly. I'm fixing RewriteRouter along with that addition. Take a look there. If you won't supply default for the action, the route won't be matched and even a single parameter won't be returned.

Martel -- I had just run into that and fixed it... and then discovered you had already! Thanks!
