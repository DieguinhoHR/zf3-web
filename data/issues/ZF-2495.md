### Description

In the Zend\_Mime\_Part class on the line 145 is this call:

return Zend\_Mime::encode($this->\_content, $this->encoding, $EOL);

But Zend\_Mime::encode() doesn't have 3 parameters!!!

I think that this is huge bugs whitch cause, that Zend\_Mime::encode() don't use right end line characters.

I will send patch.
