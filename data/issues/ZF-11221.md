### Description

Hello,

i wanna set a custom attribute to a label, but that is not possible.

Example (is a little bit different, because of my abstraction):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $macLockedComment = new Form_Element_Textarea('macLockedComment');
    $macLockedComment->setAttrib('style', 'display: none');
    
    // <-- this is NOT possible
    $macLockedComment->getLabel()->setAttrib('style', 'display: none'); 
    
    $this->addFieldset($macLockedComment, 'mainData');


Nice would be a fluent interface like for the whole form element. Or a simple method for setting attributes to the label.

{quote} $macLockedComment->getLabel()->setAttrib('style', 'display: none'); {quote} Very bad idea! The method "getLabel" returns the content of the label.

[API-Doc: Zend\_Form\_Element::getLabel()](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Form/Element/Zend_Form_Element.html#getLabel)

You can use the decorator:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->getElement('foo')->getDecorator('label')->setOption('style', 'display: none;');


This is not a workaround, this is the normal behaviour!

This is not a bug!

I know that this is the normal behaviour.

This line should have been only a suggestion for implementing it.

Because the label itself is a own object, there should be a possibility to change it over the object, not the decorator - IMO

But thanks for the solution.

{quote} Because the label itself is a own object, there should be a possibility to change it over the object, not the decorator - IMO {quote} All elements from Zend\_Form represents objects with which a user can interact. This is not an invention or an idea from the Zend Framework. It corresponds to the W3C HTML standard. These special elements are called "controls":

<a href="">www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.1</a>" rel="nofollow">HTML4: 17 Forms - 17.1 Introduction to forms <a href="">www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.2</a>" rel="nofollow">HTML4: 17 Forms - 17.2 Controls

Control types are:

- buttons
- checkboxes
- radio buttons
- menus
- text input
- file select
- hidden controls
- object controls

A label element is used to specify labels for controls, but itself it is not a control!

<a href="">www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.9</a>" rel="nofollow">HTML4: 17 Forms - 17.9 Labels

I see no reason why Zend\_Form deviate from the HTML standard. (Also HTML5 brings no change here.)
