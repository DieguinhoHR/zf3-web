### Description

There is a slight problem when using ErrorHandler plugin and the ViewRenderer action helper.

When in action controller I do : $this->render('someview') and someview.phtml contains something like :

{quote}html code ... <?php echo $this->render('nonexistantview'); ?> html code ... {quote}

errorController gets launched which is correct behaviour BUT... when my error controller launches another view i get something like :

{quote} html code which was rendered until exception occured... the error View html code {quote}

im not sure if that is intender behaviour, i tried clearing response body etc. but i would expect only the error view to be rendered. I could not find any way to surpress data output of the orginal view.

This issue required two changes, one to the dispatcher, and one to the documentation.

In the dispatcher, I now catch exceptions from action controllers. If caught, it then checks the output buffer level against that present before dispatching the action, and it closes the buffers as necessary.

In the documentation, I also added a section explaining how to clear the response body if so desired.

Revisions committed in r5336.
