### Description

Allowing NTLM Authentication through SOAP and HTTP Clients for accessing Microsoft Style server with NT Lan Manager Authentication.

This has been done outside Zend. See here. [http://rabaix.net/articles/2008/â€¦](http://rabaix.net/articles/2008/3/13/using-soap-php-with-ntlm-authentication)

NTLM Authentication has to be implemented either using stream wrappers and curl (like it's done in the link in the description) or at SOAP extension level.

Using stream wrappers may have several side effects, so it's not planned to implement this feature in nearest future.
