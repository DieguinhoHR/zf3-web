### Description

_OS:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Darwin calista.local 8.10.1 Darwin Kernel Version 8.10.1: Wed May 23 16:33:00 PDT 2007; root:xnu-792.22.5~1/RELEASE_I386 i386 i386


SVN Revision: trunk

PHP:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP 5.2.4 (cli) (built: Oct 12 2007 14:44:33) 
    Copyright (c) 1997-2007 The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2007 Zend Technologies

Locale: en\_us

Test Code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Currency.php';
    $c = new Zend_Currency('en_US');
    echo $c->toCurrency(1000);


Result Expected: $ 1,000.00

BC Math Result: $ 1,000.00 No BC Math Result: $ 1,000.

The last 2 digits seem to get left off when you don't have BCMath enabled

Please change your file with the added one (Zend/Locale/Math/PhpMath.php) and give us response if this solves the problems with your environment.

Some reworks of the locale math helper class.

Integrated and solved with SVN 6652.
