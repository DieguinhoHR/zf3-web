ZF-10528: Zend Mail not setting return path

### Description

I've been having problems setting the return path of each email sent out. When setting the from address this overrides any changes to the return path. It seems the return path is still being set as on one of my mail servers one email had two return path headers.

In the meantime I have reverted back to version 10.8.4 which doesn't seem to have the same problem.

I'm going to track back where the headers are being set and I'll release a patch if I can find the source of the problem.

I assume you are using the SMTP transport? If so this has been resolved in ZF-8988 and the fix will appear in 1.11.1 release. Please reopen if this remains an issue.
