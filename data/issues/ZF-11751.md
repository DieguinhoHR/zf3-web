### Description

When i try to validate this email: dorotabaran@.pl.eu the validator tells me that it is invalid. That ok.

But it uses in this case an regular expression $\_validIdns[EU][6]

/^[\\x{002d}0-9a-zἀ-ἇἐ-ἕἠ-ἧἰ-ἷὀ-ὅὐ-ὗὠ-ὧὰ-ώᾀ-ᾇᾐ-ᾗᾠ-ᾧᾰ-ᾴᾶᾷῂῃῄῆῇῐ-ΐῖῗῠ-ῧῲῳῴῶῷ]{1,63}$/iu

thisone fails with an error that is masked with @, but written into our error-log.

I tried this regular expression and get the error:

preg\_match(): Compilation failed: range out of order in character class at offset 70

For validate a email do use class Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress. Your example is really a invalid email dorotabaran@.pl.eu

The correct could be dorotabaran@pl.eu

@Raphael: Your comment has nothing to do with the described error

Fixed in ZF2 with [GH-447](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/447)
