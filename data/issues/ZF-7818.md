### Description

Trying to draw an image with the Zend\_Pdf component ends up with the error 'JPG support is not configured properly.' The Problem is a improvement in PHP 5.3.0. In the file Zend/Pdf/Resource/Image/Jpeg.php you can find the following if statement on line 60/61:

$gd\_options = gd\_info(); if (!$gd\_options['JPG Support'] ) {

With the version 5.3.0 of PHP the "JPG Support" attribute has been renamed to "JPEG Support". <http://de.php.net/manual/de/function.gd-info.php>
