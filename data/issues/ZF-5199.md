ZF-5199: Zend\_Db\_Select should make use of Zend\_Db\_Table instances in from() and join() clauses

### Description

Look at Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select from() method :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function from($name, $cols = self::SQL_WILDCARD, $schema = null)
    {
    if ($name instanceof Zend_Db_Table_Abstract) {
                $info = $name->info();
                $name = $info[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::NAME];
                if (isset($info[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::SCHEMA])) {
                    $schema = $info[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::SCHEMA];
                }
            }
    // ...


That is nice, and I wonder why that has'nt been implemented in Zend\_Db\_Select class. Same for join() : Why cant we use a Zend\_Db\_Table instance in it ?

Use case asked :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->select()->from($aTable)->join($anotherTable) ...
    // $db is a Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
    // $aTable and $anotherTable are both Zend_Db_Table_Abstract objects

Why should Zend\_Db\_Select be aware of anything Zend\_Db\_Table? Wouldnt this introduce a level of unwanted coupling? Isnt this what Z\_D\_T\_Select is for?

@Ralph Schindler:

Here's why I vote for this issue. I have a table "Foo" for which I have created a subclass of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract called FooTable. I want to select a single value from a single column of "Foo", but Zend\_Db\_Table does not have a fetchOne() method, whereas Zend\_Db\_Adapter does. So I use Zend\_Db\_Adapter for the query. However, I want my FooTable class to completely encapsulate the database table, so that if I decide to change the name of the table from "Foo" to "BetterFoo", I only have to make a change in one place.

Instead of doing this:

$select = $db\_adapter->select()->from("Foo", ...); $scalar\_val = $db\_adapter->fetchOne($select);

I want to do this:

$foo\_table = new FooTable(); $select = $db\_adapter->select()->from($foo\_table, ...); $scalar\_val = $db\_adapter->fetchOne($select);

Comments welcome!

@Ian:

Not a valid reason for Zend\_Db\_Select to need extra code to need be aware of Zend\_Db\_Table.

take a look at the docs here [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.advanced.usage)

You can already retrieve specific columns with Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new MyTable();
    $table->select()->from($table, array('my_column'))->fetchRow();


If you really want the same behavior as Zend\_Db\_Select#fetchOne() (that is, return a single value as a result) then you can do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new MyTable();
    $select = $table->select()->from($table, array('my_column'));
    $result = $table->getAdapter()->fetchOne($select);

@Marc Hodgins:

Your second code snippet addresses my concern quite well. I didn't realize you could pass a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select to Zend\_Db\_Adapter->fetchOne(). (Of course, now that I look more closely at the API docs, I see that Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select inherits from Zend\_Db\_Select, so I guess I could have figured this out on my own.)

Thanks for the feedback/lesson. Your (and Ralph's) point about keeping Zend\_Db\_Select unaware of Zend\_Db\_Table is a good one, so I'll "unvote" this issue.
