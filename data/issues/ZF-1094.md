### Description

This may lead into a possible bug in the registry however with slight usage modifications it works as expected. the page for the specific documentation I am referring to is: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.registry.html#zend.registry.using.array-object)

the sample code that is given in the Zend\_Registry documenation is as follows:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php
    // in your application bootstrap:
    $registry = new Zend_Registry(array(), ArrayObject::ARRAY_AS_PROPS)
    Zend_Registry::setInstance($registry);
    
    // elsewhere in your application:
    $registry = Zend_Registry::get();
    
    $registry->index = $value;
    
    var_dump($registry->index);
    ?>


when running this code from the bootstrap file, I get several errors including: - Warning: Missing argument 1 for Zend\_Registry::get() - Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Exception' with message 'No entry is registered for key '

obviously an index needs to be specified to the get() method.

If the line "$registry = Zend\_Registry::get();" is removed from the above code, there are not only no errors or exceptions thrown, but the registry also works as expected. In short, it may be a good idea to remove that line from the documentations example code to make it read something like:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php
    $registry = new Zend_Registry(array(), ArrayObject::ARRAY_AS_PROPS);
    Zend_Registry::setInstance($registry);
    
    Zend_Registry::set('index', 'some value');
    
    var_dump($registry->index);
    ?>
