### Description

In the isValid function of Zend\_Validate\_Between has the if statements reversed.

This is how it is now: public function isValid($value) { $this->\_setValue($value);

 
        if ($this->_inclusive) {
            if ($this->_min > $value || $value > $this->_max) {
                $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN);
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if ($this->_min >= $value || $value >= $this->_max) {
                $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN_STRICT);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }


and this is how it should be: public function isValid($value) { $this->\_setValue($value);

 
        if ($this->_inclusive) {
            if ($this->_min >= $value || $value >= $this->_max) {
                $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN);
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if ($this->_min > $value || $value > $this->_max) {
                $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN_STRICT);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }


$this->\_inclusive by default is true. So if true, that means by definition of the word, that it should also check the boundaries (>=). Exclusive means don't check the boundaries just the values in between.

Why should an error be thrown when the border is 2 and the value is also at 2 when "inclusive border value" has been set? I don't get the clue why to add false behaviour?

Did you really look at the results? Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    MIN = 2
    MAX = 4
    VALUE = 2
    INC = TRUE
    
    Original:
    2(min) > 2(val) => false, 2(val) >= 4(max) => false, result true as expected
    
    Your change:
    2(min) >= 2(val) => true, result false... bogus as value equals minimum and you return false even if set that border value is inclusive
    
    
    MIN = 2
    MAX = 4
    VALUE = 2
    INC = FALSE
    
    Original:
    2(min) >= 2(val) => true, result false as expected
    
    Your change:
    2(min) > 2(val) => false, 2(val) > 4(max) => false, result true... bogus as 2 touches the border and inc is false
