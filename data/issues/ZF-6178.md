### Description

When requesting ids through the getIds() method, and trying to remove some of them with remove(), the cache prefix is applied to the id, even though getIds() gives the ids with the prefix already attached at the front. This means that the remove will always fail because the id is invalid.

Tried this with the File backend, but suspect other backends to fail as well.
