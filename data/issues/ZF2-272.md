### Description

I suggest removing the EventManager dependency from the cache component. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I also think it could be optional without harming too much.

Use Case:

I'm not using the full stack framework, I'm instead pulling in components from various places. From what I understand, this is one of the intended uses, and why ZF2 is broken down into more isolated components.

I'm using Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher quite heavily (as a choice). I'm using Doctrine2, which requires Doctrine\\Common\\EventManager I'm wanting to use Zend\\Cache, which requires a 3rd event system: Zend\\EventManager.

Seeing a third event system is a little much and hard to justify. In a perfect world, it'd be nice to see it standardized so we could pass the same one around (if there was a standardized EventManagement / Event interface across the community), but I'd be very happy if it just became optional instead.

Thanks!

Hi Adrian

the complete plugin structure is implemented on top of the Zend\\EventManager component. It's "currenty" not possible to make it compatible the Synfony's EventDispatcher or Doctrine's EventManager.

But as sayed the plugin system is based on it the adapter interface doesn't depents on it.

That means: - you are free to write your own Adapter without the plugin system. - the event manager will only be used internally and you can write a proxy redirecting triggered events from the one triggered by Zend\\Cache\\Storage\\Adapter\\AbstractAdapter to your used event system.

NOTE: Currently the AdapterOptions and the Capabilities assumes the usage of the EventManager. That will be fixed with <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1098>
