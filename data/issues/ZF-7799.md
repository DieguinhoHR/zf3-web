ZF-7799: Zend\_Mail Blank line above all emails sent

### Description

When Zend\_Mail sends an email, there is one too many blank lines between the headers and the body. Most email clients seem to ignore this, but Gmail shows the blank line.

As far as I can tell, Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract::\_prepareHeaders() always puts a new line after the headers, then Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail::\_sendMail() passes this straight to the mail() function. Putting trim() in either function solves it for me, but I have not tested other transports.

Confirmed on outlook 2007, it also shows the additional blank line.

I have checked this issue and it appears to be a Sendmail Transport specific issue.

I will add a patch and unittest and apply that tonight when i have my SVN account credentials with me ;)
