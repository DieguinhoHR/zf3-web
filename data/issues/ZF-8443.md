### Description

Informix-querys with Zend\_DB\_Adapter\_Ibm\_Pdo fail with SQL-error due to standardly quoted field names. Should be the possibility to set $\_autoQuoteIdentifiers = false if Servertyp is IDS (Informix Dynamic Server).

I am a collegue of Gunnar Fratzke. We discussed this topic and I think this is not a bug.

The error occured because our Informix installation is kind of special and does not accept quoted field names.

We found as solution to disable autoQuoteIdentifiers in XML Config:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      hostname0

It's effectively the goal of this option. Closed as not an issue.
