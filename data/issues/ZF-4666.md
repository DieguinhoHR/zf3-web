### Description

I am tracing out the XML that Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client is building up so this is before we even hit the server and this is where I see the values stripped.

Trace report:

This array contains original form value with no modification.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    ( 
        [name] => 
        [location] => UK:ABR:ABRWEST 
        [description] => D sseldorf 
        [category] => Geography 
        [Image] => UK_ABR_ABRWEST.gif 
        [savelevel] => savelevel 
    ) 


This array is post htmlentities convert.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array 
    ( 
        [name] => 
        [location] => UK:ABR:ABRWEST 
        [description] => DÃ¼sseldorf 
        [category] => Geography 
        [Image] => UK_ABR_ABRWEST.gif 
        [savelevel] => savelevel 
    ) 


This is the Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client dump and the description field is blank.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
    Forms.ProcessZoneDetailsnamelocationUK:ABR:ABRWESTdescriptioncategoryGeographyImageUK_ABR_ABRWEST.gifsavelevelsavelevel

This is another dump using a description with no unusual characters and description value is filled.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array 
    ( 
        [name] => 
        [location] => UK:ABR:ABRWEST 
        [description] => Dusseldorf 
        [category] => Geography 
        [Image] => UK_ABR_ABRWEST.gif 
        [savelevel] => savelevel 
    ) 


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array 
    ( 
        [name] => 
        [location] => UK:ABR:ABRWEST 
        [description] => Dusseldorf 
        [category] => Geography 
        [Image] => UK_ABR_ABRWEST.gif 
        [savelevel] => savelevel

Can you please test against current trunk? A change was recently made to use the set encoding when creating the response, and may correct this issue.

Hi,

This issue is still unresolved. I am now using ZF 1.7.1

A search of Google and this is not the only XML-RPC library that has suffered from this issue.

e.g.

<http://www.openlaszlo.org/jira/browse/LPP-2565>
