### Description

Add support for explicit namespace.name => function/method mapping.

Similar in nature to:

[http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/â€¦](http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/basic-server-construction.php)

Essentially, expected api:

$server->addMethod($functionName, $functionMethodCallback);

if ($this) was passed in $functionmethodCallback, the server SHOULD NOT attempt to clone or recreate the object, instead it should map the call the to already passed in object. This will be useful when embedding an XMLRPC server inside a controllers action.

Addionally, if a valid callback is presented as strings, an object should be created.

For more info, contact me if need be.

Tentatively scheduling for 1.1.0. It requires changes to Zend\_Server\_Reflection, as well as to each server class.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

A new component, Zend\_Server\_Definition, was added to allow better, more performant caching ability in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server (and the JSON-RPC server). This component also achieves the goal of this request -- you can define your own Zend\_Server\_Method\_Definition objects, attach them to the Zend\_Server\_Definition, and pass this to loadFunctions(). This allows for fully customizable server definitions.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
