### Description

The Romanian currency identifier has been changed on 2006 from ROL to RON due to denomination.

I guess we need to add to XML's (ro.xml) a new entry:

 
            <currency type="RON">
                <symbol>lei</symbol>
            </currency>


And to the rest same thing

The underlaying data is from UNICODE.ORG (CLDR Project). It is not allowed to change the data and give it as download to users for the ZF Project.

Any problem within the CLDR Data itself should be written to unicode and not to ZF. <http://www.unicode.org/cldr>

As the data for CLDR is always changing, every few months a new version is avaiable. As soon as 1.5 is released we will integrate it into ZF.
