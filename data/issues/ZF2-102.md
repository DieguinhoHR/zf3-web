### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    D:\ZF2\tests>phpunit --verbose Zend
    PHP Warning:  date_default_timezone_get(): It is not safe to rely on the system'
    s timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the
    date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and
    you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone iden
    tifier. We selected 'Europe/Paris' for '1.0/no DST' instead in D:\ZF2\tests
    \Zend\Cache\TestCommonBackend.php on line 54
