### Description

Hi,

I am actually not sure if this is a bug or simply a gap in the manual. I tried to set the visibility and event status of a google calendar entry. This is what I've tried so far:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $event = $service->newEventEntry ();
    [...]
    // set title, content, reminder, etc. of the new event
    [...]
    $event->visibility = $service->newVisibility ( array('Visibility' => 'private' ));
    $event->eventstatus = $service->newEventStatus ( array('EventStatus' => 'tentative' ));


Beside that, I've also tried...

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $event->visibility = $service->newVisibility ( 'private' );
    $event->eventstatus = $service->newEventStatus ( 'tentative' );
    $event->visibility = $service->newVisibility ( array('visibility' => 'private' ));
    $event->eventstatus = $service->newEventStatus ( array('eventstatus' => 'tentative' ));
    $event->visibility = $service->newVisibility ( array('private' ));
    $event->eventstatus = $service->newEventStatus ( array('tentative' ));


...to set the event status and visibility. No matter what I try, the event is always being created without the specified visibility or event status.

Regards, Christian

Hi,
