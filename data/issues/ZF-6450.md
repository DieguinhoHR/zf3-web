ZF-6450: Automatic scanning problem with linux due to default ignore option

### Description

The problem relies in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter

I am using the following call to instantiate my Zend\_Translate: $translate = new Zend\_Translate('gettext', 'Joobsbox/Languages/main', $conf->general->locale, array('scan' => Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_FILENAME));

The specified path contains multiple files named $locale.mo (example: en.mo, fr.mo etc)

When used on Windows, XAMPP Lite it works like a charm. When used on Linux, during the scan of the directory, it skips them because of the code at line 152 in Zend/Translate/Adapter.php : if (strpos($directory, DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR . $this->\_options['ignore']) !== false) { // ignore files matching first characters from option 'ignore' and all files below continue; }

Having commented this line, it worked. The explanation is that because of my host (Dreamhost) the language files have the following path: /home/.thug/joobs/<>/joobsbox-php/Joobsbox/Languages/main

So the default ignore option "." actually returns 5 in this case, so it skips all the files.

I'm sorry, but this is not a issue. The "ignore" option was added to allow users to deny the searching of hidden directories.

As most file systems use "." as char for hidden directories, like SVN or Windows, the decission was to use it as default.

You have 2 documented ways to solve this... \* Disable the ignore option completly \* or simply define your own ignore which allows the needed directory structure to pass
