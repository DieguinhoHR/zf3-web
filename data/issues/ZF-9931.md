ZF-9931: Patch to fix a little bug introduced in r19527 (Manually register the 'resourceLoader' if not already set)

### Description

In Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Boostrap constructor this code was added at r19527

{quote} if ($application->hasOption('resourceloader')) { $this->setOptions(array( 'resourceloader' => $application->getOption('resourceloader') )); } $this->getResourceLoader(); {quote}

But the if statement needs to test if, even after the calling the constructor, the option is NOT set... {quote} if (!$application->hasOption('resourceloader')) { {quote} ...then we do it manually.

Finally, I think it's a bug so I have changed the prioprity to Minor, the issue type to Bug and added some more text in the description.

Tried your patch and got fatal error

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Catchable fatal error:
    Argument 1 passed to Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap::setResourceLoader()
    must be an instance of Zend_Loader_Autoloader_Resource, null given


I think that it's testing if the application has option resourceloader to be set for the bootstrap. If the application does not have this option there is nothing to set so skip over.

Marking as not an issue.
