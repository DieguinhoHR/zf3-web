### Description

Checked against version 1.9.0b1 and 1.8.4

/Zend/Json/Server/Request.php setId

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_id = (string) $name;


should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!is_numeric($name)) {
                    # todo: throw exception
                $this->_id = (string) $name;
            } else {
                $this->_id = $name;
            }


Based on jsonRPC spec [http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-1-2-proposal?pli=1) "This id can be used to correlate a Response with its Request. The server MUST reply with the same value."

So if the request was a string it should return a string, if the request was an int it should return an int
