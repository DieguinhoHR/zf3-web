### Description

First, let me say that I presume this is a problem with the documentation rather than the code.

In section 6.1 in the manual, we're told that "without any arguments, constructing an instance returns an object in the default locale with the current date." Example 6.2 shows us just that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
       require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
       $date = new Zend_Date();
       // Output of the current timestamp
       print $date;
    ?>


This doesn't work. The first argument is actually required (currently). Again, I presume it's a documentation issue, but I'm not sure.

And, for those that may not be sure, the static method, Zend\_Date::now(), will probably suffice for most situations. :-)

Thanks.

The default behaviour of date objects is always that if no value is given, the actual timestamp should be used.

See date('Ymd'); for example or the new date object from php.

So we also have to do standard behaviour. Which means that our constructor has also to allow loosing this parameter.

The following examples work: new Zend\_Date(); new Zend\_Date('ja'); Zend\_Date::now();

Fixed with SVN 3131 but only for I18N branch.
