ZF-1779: Undefined variable: response in HTTP request error handling code

### Description

I've gotten this twice now. I'm not sure what the error is that's causing this because I don't have a dump of the exception, but it should be investigated.

The error I'm getting is:

{quote}Notice: Undefined variable: response in .../library/Zend/Gdata/App.php on line 409

Fatal error: Call to a member function getBody() on a non-object in .../library/Zend/Gdata/Gapps.php on line 133{quote}

This is inside of post(). My guess is that something is causing the HTTP request to fail before generating a response.

At the very least, this could be fixed by initializing $response to null before calling Zend\_Http\_Client::post().

Trevor, this is a really old ticket. Is this still something you can reproduce and if so can you provide a failing test case?
