ZF-2543: 'controller' parameter shouldn't appear in URI

### Description

I created a new route (I was using the standard one) like this:

$router->addRoute( 'families', new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('families/:action/\*', array('module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'categories', 'action' => 'index')) );

And it worked BUT now it generates URIs like:

/families/edit/controller/categories/id/4

I can't understand why it's including 'controller' parameter.

Scheduling for next mini release; Martel, let me know if you cannot do this for 1.5.3.

I have created a test showing current expected route behaviour. As you see, it doesn't include controller in the URL. Closing.

If it's not what you meant, please modify the test to show what you have in mind. I'll reopen the issue then.
