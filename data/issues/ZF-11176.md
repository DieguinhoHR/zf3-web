### Description

Currently, in SQLite, foreign keys are disabled and enabling them requires a query to the database before any other query which may be constrained by a foreign key.

Since Zend\_Db\_Adapter allows for lazy loading of the database connection, it would allow for a directive in the configuration to enable foreign key constraints at the time of connection, thus ensuring the query to enable the constraints is called once and prior to any other queries.

As, pointed out by Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme) in <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10473>, disabling foreign keys is not good practice and thus the option to enable foreign keys in the adapter, should be limited to simply enabling foreign keys and not disabling. If needed, for what ever reason these constraints can still be disabled by querying the database.
