### Description

Looks like my bug report within comments of [ZF-5372] have been unheard, so I chose to open a new bug report for it. The situation is that [ZF-5372] was demoted as a non-bug but rather a design choice. But this is a different issue which I'm not sure it should be treated together with [ZF-5372]. Further details and patch can be seen at [[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5372?focusedCommentId=27666#action_27666)].

Thanks.

When will it be fixed? Nearly one year has passed!

This issue is a duplicate of ZF-3309. Discussion and remediation of the failure of joinUsing to respect table aliases is being handled from there.
