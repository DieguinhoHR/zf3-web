For problems with Zend Server (not Zend Framework), you can try this forum: <http://forums.zend.com/viewforum.php?f=44>

And for the ZF issues, please ask on the mailing list or IRC; these are not issues with the framework, but with your configuration, and folks on the list will be able to help you.

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'not an issue' don't need a fix version.
