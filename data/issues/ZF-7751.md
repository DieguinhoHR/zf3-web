ZF-7751: Add support for extended fault codes
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-09-02T03:31:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:06.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently when an exception with the code, e.g. 123 is thrown, it's converted to the Receiver fault code, since SOAP allows only a set of base faults: (Receiver, Sender, Server, MustUnderstand, VersionMismatch, DataEncodingUnknown).

However, SOAP also supports extending those base faults with your own codes. By using the . (dot) as a separator.

It would be nice if the server can support this standard notation.

Note: The challenge, which I think should be tackled in a separate issue once this is done, is to how to convert exception codes (Integers) to an extended fault. One way which we currently use is to throw My\_Soap\_Fault instead of SoapFault, and My\_Soap\_Fault is has a set of rules which it uses to convert an exception code, e.g. 123 to Sender.123, but 789 to Receiver.789.
