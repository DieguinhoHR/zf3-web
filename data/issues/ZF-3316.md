### Description

There is a n error located here : [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.adapter-notes.pdo-sqlite) abour PDO\_SQLite configuration

it says : To connect to an SQLite2 database, specify 'dsnprefix'=>'sqlite2' in the array of parameters when creating an instance of the Pdo\_Sqlite Adapter.

But if you look @ the source code in Db/Adapter/Pdo/Sqlite.php there is no config params like dsnprefix

code comment say : \* sqlite2 => (boolean) PDO\_SQLITE defaults to SQLite 3. For compatibility \* with an older SQLite 2 database, set this to TRUE.

so the config parameters is sqlite2 ( true|false) not dsnprefix
