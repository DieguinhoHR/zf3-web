### Description

Zend\_Json\_Encoder does not support encoding of UTF8 characters.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Json_Encoder::encode('Отладочный')


yields

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "Отладочный"


instead of the following which is generated with json\_encode() which does support UTF8 characters

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439"
