### Description

It would be useful to have access to the total count of the model within the partialLoop, as we do with the current position in the loop (partialCounter). This would allow you to do stuff like echo "item $this->partialCounter of $this->totalCount" as well as some HTML styling which requires a different class for the final

 in an . To implement, add code like: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial 74 if (isset($this->partialTotalCount)) { 75 $view->partialTotalCount= $this->partialTotalCount; 76 } Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartiaLoop: 89 $this->partialCount = count($model);
