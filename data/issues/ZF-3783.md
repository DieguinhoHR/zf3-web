ZF-3783: SubControllers in default module create invalid helper prefix

### Description

Currently, when using sub controllers in the default module, a helper path based on the leading path segment is created, instead of using the default. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    application/
        controllers/
            Admin/
                FooController.php
        views/
            helpers/
                SomeHelper.php


application/views/helpers/SomeHelper.php would contain the class Zend\_View\_Helper\_SomeHelper. If an action in Admin\_FooController is invoked and the view calls the someHelper() helper, it will attempt to resolve it to Admin\_View\_Helper\_SomeHelper and not find it.

This is still broken. I just checked revision 10525.

If you feel it is still broken, then I need a reproduce case. This should include the minimal amount of application structure necessary to reproduce the issue. I will re-open the issue once you have posted a reproduce case.

This is minimum setup for recreate of bug. Zip includes bootstrap and module Admin, View Helper and view scripts.

Unfortunately, you're using so many non-standard options, it's difficult to track down the issue.The combination of (a) not specifying a default module name (b) using non-standard paths in the ViewRenderer, and (c) not utilizing the error handler plugin is not helping unmask the problem. I'm attaching a tarball that _does_ show the issue, however, using default settings for most cases.

Simplified example. Navigate to /admin/index/test to see the issue.
