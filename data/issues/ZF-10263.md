ZF-10263: Unable to use startMvc() in a subclass of Zend\_Layout due to use of 'self' keyword
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-08-04T11:03:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-14T00:24:01.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - Next Major Release ()

### Description

Test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    class MyLayout extends Zend_Layout
    {
    }
    
    $layout = MyLayout::startMvc();
    
    echo get_class($layout);


Expected output: MyLayout

Actual output: Zend\_Layout

This is due to the use of the 'self' keyword in startMvc() which statically binds to the Zend\_Layout class, irrespective of any subclasses. More info: <http://bugs.php.net/30934>

Here's a patch, but it only works on PHP 5.3+ due to the use of get\_called\_class(). <http://pastie.org/1075598>

You can actually override the behavior within versions of PHP prior to 5.3; you just need to copy and paste the methods "getMvcInstance()" and "startMvc()" into your subclass. Once you have, however, all calls to either My\_Layout::getMvcInstance() or Zend\_Layout::getMvcInstance() will return a My\_Layout object as long as you started the session using My\_Layout.

I've blogged about this type of extension previously: [http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/â€¦](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/135-Extending-Singletons.html)

In the meantime, we cannot make changes such as you suggest until 2.0, so I'm marking that as the fix version.

Will no be fixed in ZF1. No longer an issue with ZF2
