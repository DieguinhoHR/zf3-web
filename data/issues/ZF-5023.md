ZF-5023: Allow PEAR naming conventions for controller classes.

### Description

Allow PEAR naming conventions by default for Controllers.

For instance instead of:

- Application 
  - - Controllers
    - - - IndexController.php
      - IndexController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action

We should be allowed: - Application - - Controller - - - Index.php + Application\_Controller\_Index extends Zend\_Controller\_Action

Just a suggestion?

This can be accomplished already by creating your own dispatcher. Please look at the API docs for Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface/Abstract/Standard to get an idea of how to accomplish this.
