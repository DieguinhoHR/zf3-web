### Description

As I suggested already in ZF-8011. Please don't modify code from programmer in ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_JQuery\_Container::addJavascript().

 
    *  Why should PHP class fix JavaScript code which a programmer wrote ? He could make much more mistakes then to forget ; in last line or to enter too many spaces.
    * Programmer could not put ; or } with a reason.
    * This processing is taking unnecessary CPU on each request.
    * It is confusing to the JavaScript programmer that his code got changed.
    * Zend_View_Helper_HeadScript helper does not do such changes to javascript code


Please remove following lines in ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_JQuery\_Container::addJavascript():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $js = trim($js);
    if (!in_array(substr($js, -1), array(';', '}'))) {
        $js .= ';';
    }
