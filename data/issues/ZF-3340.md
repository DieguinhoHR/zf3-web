ZF-3340: PHP 5.2.6 RecursiveDirectoryIterator changes break Zend\_Translate scan directory

### Description

In PHP 5.2.6, the output of RecursiveDirectoryIterator's \_\_toString when using KEY\_AS\_PATHNAME changed in such a way that Zend\_Translate is no longer able to use the directory scanning method. You can see the change by running the following script:

<?php $iterator = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator('/some/directory', RecursiveDirectoryIterator::KEY\_AS\_PATHNAME);

foreach($iterator as $item) { echo (string) $item . "\\n"; }

On 5.2.5, only the filename is output, but on 5.2.6, the path and filename are output.

The obvious fix is to stop relying on the \_\_toString() method and use the getFilename() method.

Fixed in trunk.

I hate it when PHP changes how things work without any notification. They should also use unit testing. :-)
