ZF-8770: Zend\_Application\_Resource\_View doesn't use static helper broker

### Description

Zend\_Application\_Resource\_View directly instantiates Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer rather than using the helper broker so the options passed in through Zend\_Application aren't actually kept. To fix this, it should be as simple as changing:

Zend/Application/Resource/View.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $viewRenderer = new Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_ViewRenderer();


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $viewRenderer = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('viewRenderer');

Never mind.

Ooh, those are the easy issues. :D

Now this one does look worth investigating (to me), so why did you resolve it with 'never mind'?

Had to reopen issue in order to change component and assignee. Leaving open just for a while (until I found out if the issue is legit, or why it was a Nvm).
