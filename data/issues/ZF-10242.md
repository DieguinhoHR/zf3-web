### Description

to be able to do

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $contacts = $gdata->getFeed($contactsQuery);
    $total = count($contacts);


Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Feed needs to be implementing Countable interface. It already implements Iterator and ArrayAccess.

Now the only way is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $contacts = $gdata->getFeed($contactsQuery);
    $total = $contacts->count();

I consider a improvement and not a bug.

It is technically an improvement, but it leads to bugs (because of the wrong expectations) and I'm almost sure that it was supposed to be so, just somebody accidentally missed 'Countable'.

Fixed with r22880.
