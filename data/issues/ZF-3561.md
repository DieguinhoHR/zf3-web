### Description

I am trying to implement a solution that ensures that any given request never takes longer than a certain number of seconds. In the current implementation however it is only possible to set a timeout for the initial connect, but not for the time it takes for the server to actually return the entire request.

In PEAR::HTTP\_Request they provide a listener solution for this (which also enables download progress bars): [http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/pear/â€¦](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/pear/HTTP_Request/Request/Listener.php?view=markup)
