### Description

Discussed with Thomas Wiedner regarding the where() that used to implode an array of values for use in "IN (...)" inside a SQL but broke in 1.0.2+ where they are imploding only the first array element (for the single placeholder):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Giving an array as input would result in each single placeholder to be replaced.
    
    where("price > ? and price <= ?", array(2, 10));
    becomes
    "where (price > 2 and price <= 10)"
    
    This is the reason why the automatic imploding does not work anymore.
    
    Principially there are several ways:
    You could for example do the following:
    
    $array = array(2,10,14,20);
    $addwhere = "";
    for($i = 1; $i < count($array); ++$i) {
       $addwhere .= ", ?";
    }
    
    $where = "price IN (?". $addwhere.")";
    $db->where($where, $array);
    
    In my eyes it would be better to have a own "IN" function avaiable for such clauses. I am actually also working on a BEWTEEN function which adds between to be avaiable.
    
    So eighter you use a the codesnippet I gave you or you add a new issue for creating a "IN" function which handles the IN within the where clause.


The old code used to be generic and would apply to both - a normal where clause with a boolean operator or an IN operator because it used to implode the array into a list of values but the new enhancements need IN-operators handled differently using arrays and multiple placeholders. I guess having a separate in() function for such expressions is more ideal and desired at the component level.

Thanks!

Unassigned as original additional where methodology was not accepted.

Actually the where clause has been reworked and supports the array - in syntax as before. So there is no need for an explicit "in" method as the standard where can be used without problems.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->where("column IN (?)", array(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7));
