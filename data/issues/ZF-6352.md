ZF-6352: Zend\_Cache::save() encoding problem
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-04-20T01:43:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-05-01T00:32:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_Cache::start() to save a paginator object, encoding of stored db query result gets broken (originally UTF-8).

if (!$this->view->frontPageArticles = $this->\_cache->load('frontPageArticles')) { $content = new CMS\_Model\_Content(); $this->view->frontPageArticles = $content->getFrontpageContent($this->\_params['page']); //gets Zend\_Paginator object $this->\_cache->save($this->view->frontPageArticles,'frontPageArticles');  
 }

When the last line of code is commented (and cache purged), everything is ok (chars like ěščř... are displayed correctly).

ZF 1.8

please provide a little piece of code to reproduce the problem because there is already a unit test about UTF8 into cache records and there is no problem about it

I close this issue because I think that you have an HTTP header problem or something like that. With default configuration, Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page does not save the "content-type" http header (but there are some options to do that) and IMHO your problem is here.

If I'm wrong, please reopen this issue with a little piece of code to reproduce your UTF8 problem.

Regards

Well, as you can see here: <http://frontend.pctuning.cz/> , there isn't a problem with whole page but only with the content touched by Zend\_Cache (the main article, which is, I think, clear).

The code:

1) Bootstrap:

$cache = Zend\_Cache::factory( 'Core', 'File', array( 'lifetime' => (15\*60), 'automatic\_serialization' => true, 'caching' => CACHE\_ENABLED ), array( 'cache\_dir' => '../store/cache/' ) ); Zend\_Registry::set('MainCache',$cache);

2) Controller:

private $\_cache;

 
    public function init()
    {
        $this->_params = $this->getRequest()->getUserParams();
        $this->_cache = Zend_Registry::get('MainCache');
    }
    
    public function indexAction()
    {
    
        if (!$this->view->frontPageArticles = $this->_cache->load('frontPageArticles'))
        {
            $content = new CMS_DbTable_Content();
            $this->view->frontPageArticles = $content->getFrontpageContent($this->_params['page']);
            $this->_cache->save($this->view->frontPageArticles,'frontPageArticles');                
        } 
    }


3) CMS\_DbTable\_Content

public function getFrontpageContent($page = 0) {

 
            $select = $this->select();
            $select->setIntegrityCheck(false);
    
            $select->from('content')
                    ->joinInner(
                        'content_frontpage',
                        'content_frontpage.content_id = content.id',
                        array()
                    )
                    ->order('content.created DESC')
                    ->where('content.state = 1');
    
                    $paginator = new Zend_Paginator(new Zend_Paginator_Adapter_DbTableSelect($select));
                    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(15);
                    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);
    
            return $paginator;
    
        }


So as you can see, I do not cache whole page but only the returned paginator object - if I'm right, the query is proccessed after calling getCurrentItems(), so I do not really cache any data from database, so that's more weird that the data I get after calling getCurrentItems are broken.

And I did not forget to call set names utf-8 :-)

I don't know. Your code is too complex. I can't reproduce this on my linux box.

Can you try a unit test : - you save UTF8 chars into a cache record - you read this cache record

then you compare these two strings

I can confirm this issue. If you save a Zend\_Paginator object in the cache (I only tested file cache), the result that is loaded from the cache has messed up UTF-8 encoded strings.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $frontendOptions = array(
       'caching' => true,
       'lifetime' => 7200, 
       'automatic_serialization' => true
    );
    
    $backendOptions = array(
        'cache_dir' => 'cache/' 
    );
    
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    
    //Zend_Db_Table_Select object
    $select = $this->select();
    
    $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($select );
    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(10);
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber(1);
    
    $cache->save($paginator, 'a_cache_id');
    
    $cachedPaginator = $cache->load('a_cache_id');


The UTF-8 chars in $paginator are fine, in $cachedPaginator they are messed up.

I suppose this is a Zend\_Paginator or a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select or a serialize() issue.

Can you try in your configuration to store UTF8 chars (with automatic\_serialization = false) and without other objects (only UTF8 chars !) and to retrieve them from cache ?

thanks

after reading <http://fr.php.net/unserialize> comments about utf8

I think it's a unserialize() issue

please do the little test I propose in my last comment

and do it also with automatic\_serialization = true

I did some more testing and it seems to have to do with serialization, probably the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select and not the Zend\_Paginator. I only tested with Zend\_Paginator using a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select though.

This is strange:

Apparently serializing a Zend\_Paginator object that includes a result of a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select breaks the UTF-8.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $paginatorObject = serialize($paginatorObject );    
    $paginatorObject = unserialize($paginatorObject );
    
    //broken UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
        var_dump($result);
    }


Now the funny part. If we iterate over the paginator result right before serializing it, the UTF-8 will NOT be broken!

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    //itareate to preserve UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
    }   
    
    $paginatorObject = serialize($paginatorObject );    
    $paginatorObject = unserialize($paginatorObject );
    
    //working UTF-8
    foreach ($paginatorObject as $result) {
        var_dump($result);
    }


Basically this is my dirty quick fix for now. Right before I save the paginator object in the cache, I iterate over it once.

So, it is not a Zend\_Cache issue.

Maybe open a new one for Zend\_Paginator ?

Maybe, try with the latest version of PHP before
