### Description

The framework standard is that the first letter of an acronym is capitalized and all subsequent letters are lowercase. See Zend\_Acl, Zend\_Http, Zend\_Json, Zend\_Pdf, Zend\_Uri, Zend\_XmlRpc, and even Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite. Therefore, Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_APC should be Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Apc instead.
