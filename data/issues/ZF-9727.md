ZF-9727: Form and accents do not work after 1.9.6 version

### Description

Hello,

I think there is a bug, after 1.9.6. version, with Form and accents.

I put the Zend folder (all the framework) in the /library folder of my project. Or I add the path until this Zend folder to the set\_include\_path() function.

In both case, the result is the same.

When there is an accent in a word, the whole word is not displayed. This bug concerns all elements : the Title, Select element, in the value of a Submit button, etc. Every time an accent is in a word, the whole word does not appear.

When I try with a version after the 1.9.6., the bug is always here. If I try with 1.9.6 version or previous, this bug does not exist.

Hi,

I think I found the problem.

Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 115:

private $\_encoding = 'UTF-8';

I changed the value for: private $\_encoding = 'ISO-8859-1';

And now it works correctly. All accents are back.

But I work with the charset ISO-8859-1:

If I change the charset for UTF-8 I have to modify again the line 115 to the value 'UTF-8'.

It seems that the encoding is not modified dynamically in the file Abstract.php when it changed from the layout manually.

This was called out in the README.txt for 1.9.7, as well as in the public release announcements and an additional security announcement. Due to security issues with inconsistencies in encoding across components, we updated all components to use UTF-8 by default, while making it possible to configure encoding on encoding-aware components.

For the view object, you can do this with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->setEncoding('ISO-8859-1');


or from your application.ini:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.encoding = "ISO-8859-1"

OK thanks a lot Matthew.

It works perfectly.
