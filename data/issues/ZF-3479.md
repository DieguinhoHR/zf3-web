ZF-3479: Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Pop3: Wrong parsing of termination octet in multiline responses

### Description

_What steps will reproduce the problem?_ Fetch a message from a POP3 server where the email-body contains a single line with a dot ("."). For example (sent by the groups.google.com-Google Maps API):

Looking for example - Can this be done? - 2 new
-----------------------------------------------

I have a google map on a web page. I would like for the user to enter in a= =20 state and hit submit. Using AJAX, I want to be able to access a database on= =20 the server, select all the addresses in that state and return them so they c= an be displayed on the Google map. I was wondering if I have to do this using a= . NET user control since I - Mon, Jun 16 2008 1:14 pm=20 2 messages , 2 authors [http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-API/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-API/t/928e1d733e1a5c85?hl=3Den)

_What is the expected output?_ The class will read the message from the server until the termination octet (wrapped in CRLF: "\\r\\n.\\r\\n") occurs.

_What do you see instead?_ The class will read the message and return only the contents until the single line with the dot "." appears. Apparently, it is not parsing the termination octet as returned by the server correctly and assumes that any line in a message containing only a dot "." represents a termination octet.

_Can you provide a fix for this problem?_ In line 188 in Zend/mail/Protocol/Pop3.php, replace

[code] while ($line && trim($line) != '.') { [/code]

with

[code] while ($line && $line != ".\\r\\n") { [/code]

After rereading the RFC, the proposed patch is not correct or won't fix the problem. The trim should only remove \\r and \\n, but it's used to avoid problems with non-conforming servers (like ones that terminate lines with only \\n).

Now the problem is, that a valid message with a single dot in a line would still have ".\\r\\n" and that's the same as the line with the termination octet. The server should send "..\\r\\n" (and Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Pop3 should remove the first dot), but it seems like your POP3 server isn't careful enough.

The termination octet is now handled correctly ("..\\r\\n" becomes ".\\r\\n" in the message body).

The question remains, which wrong RFC violation we should support in addition. IMO wrong newlines are more common and therefor supporting "\\n" or and other combination of "\\r" and "\\n" more important, than a server, that does not escape a line with a single dot correctly. I leave this task open for comments.

Nico, did you change the code in ZF 1.6.\*? Because a diff to 1.5.2 does not give me any changes...

Hi,

This bug still exists in the 1.6 branch (revision 12162).

In my instance, the subject line wraps and has a single '.' on the end - which after the trim gets interpreted as part of the POP3 protocol.

i.e. This is what I see when I telnet into the cyrus pop3 server and fetch the problem message :

RETR 1 +OK Message follows Return-Path: [postmaster@xxxxxxxx.co.uk](mailto:postmaster@xxxxxxxx.co.uk) Received: from xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.com ([unix socket]) by xxxxx.xxxxx.com (Cyrus v2.3.7-Invoca-RPM-2.3.7-2.el5) with LMTPA; Tue, 04 Nov 2008 05:27:46 +0000 X-Sieve: CMU Sieve 2.3 Received: from xxxxx.xxxxx.com (xxxxxx.xxxxxxx.com [xx.xx.xx.xx]) by xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.com (Postfix) with ESMTP id 7474029D92 for [return@xxxx.xxx](mailto:return@xxxx.xxx); Tue, 4 Nov 2008 05:27:46 +0000 (GMT) Received: from surfcontrol.xxxxxx.local (xx.xxx.xxx.xx) by xxxx.xxxx.xxx (PowerMTA(TM) v3.5r9) id h1vel40mav0j for [return@xxxx.com](mailto:return@xxxx.com); Tue, 4 Nov 2008 05:27:46 +0000 (envelope-from [postmaster@xxxxxxxxxxx.xx](mailto:postmaster@xxxxxxxxxxx.xx)) Date: Tue, 04 Nov 2008 05:29:16 +0000 From: [postmaster@xxxxxx.co.uk](mailto:postmaster@xxxxxx.co.uk) To: [return@xxxx.com](mailto:return@xxxx.com) Subject: AutoNotify: Payday loans on call 24 hours a day.

Note, the single full stop/period which is on the line AFTER the subject: - and it is indented correctly.

When trying to parse the above, the class fails with an unhelpful message of 'cannot retrieve message' - and ends up thinking 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed;' is the response to the previous command.....

hmm, well the original message is indented correctly; clearly posting here gets mangled.

 To: [return@xxxxx.com](mailto:return@xxxxx.com) Subject: AutoNotify: Payday loans on call 24 hours a day. Between 80 and 750 . Content-Type: multipart/mixed;

(final attempt to get it rendering properly)

Thorsten: yes it was fixed in trunk

David: That's a server problem. I've this message in my INBOX file: {quote} From next-message@example.com Mon Jan 00 00:00:00 0000 To: to@example.com Subject: Dot Test . Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2000 01:00:00 +0000 From: from@example.com X-UID: 7 Status: RO

Before the dot . is after the dot {quote}

With dovecot I get: {quote} RETR 7 +OK 139 octets To: to@example.com Subject: Dot Test .. Date: Sun, 01 Jan 2000 01:00:00 +0000 From: from@example.com

Before the dot .. is after the dot . {quote}

Maybe you could post your message source with all chars printed, including \\r and \\n - at least the snippet from your last comment.

We were using qmail and ran into the same problem ... but I can verify with version 1.8.1 it is working properly
