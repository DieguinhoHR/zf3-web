ZF-9790: allow to attach a formatter from .ini configuration and do not hardcode formatter class in Log\_Writer class

### Description

It would be great if we could attach a formatter directly through application.ini file AND without having to subclass a writer either.

Currently we can define the following entries for Zend\_Log:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.log.stream.writerName = "Stream"
    resources.log.stream.writerParams.stream = APPLICATION_PATH "/../logs/app.log"
    resources.log.stream.writerNamespace = "Library_Log_Writer"
    resources.log.stream.filterName = "Priority"
    resources.log.stream.filterParams.priority = Zend_Log::WARN
    
    // It would be great if we could add something like:
    resources.log.stream.formatterName = "MyFormaterName"
    resources.log.stream.formatterNamespace = "My_Formater_Namespace"


This would improve logging customization a lot and make it easier. It would be absolutely necessary to remove currently hardcoded formatter classes within Writer classes.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $this->_formatter = new Zend_Log_Formatter_Simple();


=> currently, to attach your own formatter, you have to create your own subclass of Writter\_Stream... Not very flexible...

Not sure if is really necessary to extend a Writer. Just setting a Formatter to the current Writer doesn't does the trick?

Here's a patch against 1.10.4 that simply duplicates the way writers and filters are generated as application resources.

I tested only:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    resources.log.db.formatterName = "Simple"
    resources.log.db.formatterParams.format = '%timestamp%: %message%'


Not the testing of Namespace.

Benoit, thanks for taking this on.

Perhaps, this should be added to the existing tests for Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Log?

Benoit -- patch looks good, but I also think Aaron's point is valid. Once the Log resource test is added, feel free to merge to the 1.11 release branch.

 

 

Posted by Benoît Durand (intiilapa) on 2011-01-23T01:16:18.000+0000

I have committed the unit test of Aaron in the trunk r23642. And, I added documentation in r23675.

Documentation appears as:

filterParams -> format

but you must to use:

formatterParams -> format

I'm using tag [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.11.7/library/Zend). this setting in application.ini just gets ignored: resources.log.stream.formatterNamespace = "Model\_Log\_Formatter"

the reason for it is that Zend\_Log calls this on line 225: $formatter = $this->\_constructFromConfig('formatter', $config, $this->\_defaultFormatterNamespace);

has this fix not been included in release yet ?

What fix are you talking about?

 

 

Posted by Peter Culak (fr0z3nk0) on 2011-09-15T08:56:25.000+0000

fix which would allow to set a namespace from through config file. the patch attached above doesn't allow that as it does: protected function \_constructFormatterFromConfig($config) + { + $formatter = $this->\_constructFromConfig('formatter', $config, $this->\_defaultFormatterNamespace);

$this->\_defaultFormatterNamespace should probably pick up formatterNamespace from config first and if not set then use default one.

This feature is added since version 1.11.3. Would you have a sample of a configuration that does not work?

You make a misreading of the source code. You should read the _getClassName_ method: a default namespace is used only if the configuration does not provide to complete the short name.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // line 295
            $namespace = $defaultNamespace;
            if (isset($config[ $type . 'Namespace' ])) {
                $namespace = $config[ $type . 'Namespace' ];
            }
    
            $fullClassName = $namespace . '_' . $className;


You should open a new issue as bug to discuss if there really is a bug on this feature.

you're right, it works fine. I was extending formatter and i didn't overload factory method so it was returning wrong class.

thanx for your time ;)
