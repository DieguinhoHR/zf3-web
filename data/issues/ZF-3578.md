### Description

In the \_\_construct() of Zend\_Config\_Xml, the function simplexml\_load\_file() is used for loading the xml file. But there is not checked if loading of the file was successfull, which causes multiple PHP warning to be thrown.

It would be nice/better to just throw an Exception when loading of the XML file was not-successfull. Something like the following would do the job:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = @simplexml_load_file($filename);
    if (false === $config) {
        throw new Zend_Config_Exception('File could not be loaded');
    }
