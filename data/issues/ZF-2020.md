This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

The problem seems to still persist in version 1.9.5.

Is there a fix available somewhere or is someone working on this already?

I wanted to do this during some BHD's, so we're basically waiting for the next BHD.

I haven't dug into it myself. Feel free however to take over this issue, I just felt like resolving a couple of \_pdf issues ;) I think chances are that it's somewhere in zend\_pdf\_color, but I'm absolutely not sure about that.

Has this been fixed, or is there any work around?

Any ideas here?
