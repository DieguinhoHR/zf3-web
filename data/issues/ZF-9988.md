ZF-9988: Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Action: switch view-included does not work properly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Type of the third argument 'viewIncluded' passed to the function 'create' in the class 'Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Action' is string, not bool. This makes the switch view-included useless.

The problem here was being caused by the while-statement on line 472 of Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console\_ArgumentParser class

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    while (($wordOnTop = array_shift($this->_argumentsWorking))){
        //...
    }


There was the possibility of $wordOnTop being == 0 which would break out the while loop i.e zf create action actionName 0 moduleName

Just change to seems to fix things

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    while (($wordOnTop = array_shift($this->_argumentsWorking)) !== false){
        //...
    }


I've attached a patch

I made several tests with Rod fix. You have also to update Action.php Otherwise you will have a fatal error.

With both fixes it is working fine, but default value. That is you must specify 1 on the command line if you want the view to be generated.

Pay attention, these fixes cause the default value to be 0 = no action/view/etc. creation

I think I found the solution. In ArgumentParser.php, apply this fix:
