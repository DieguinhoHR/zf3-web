### Description

When using the sample code in the documentation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ec2_instance = new Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2_Instance('aws_key',
                                                         'aws_secret_key');
    $return = $ec2_instance->describe();


to return a list of instances, I got no results. But I was indeed running an instance. After searching I found the solution here: [http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/…](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1927) . I successfully managed to list my european instances when changing the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    const EC2_ENDPOINT = 'ec2.amazonaws.com';


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    const EC2_ENDPOINT = 'eu-west-1.ec2.amazonaws.com';


I suggest adding a setEndpoint / setRegion method to the Ec2 classes.

I will work on this and get something in 1.8.1

I missed 1.8.1 due to time contraints with my RL job. I'm working on this tonight so it will be in 1.8.2

This was fixed with [r15647](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=15647)
