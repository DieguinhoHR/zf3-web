ZF-7226: Mysqli Adapter doesn't use all mysqli\_real\_connect parameters
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

<a href="">www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-connect.php</a>" rel="nofollow">mysqli\_real\_connect() function has 8 parameters but Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli only uses 6 of them, letting down the $socket and $flags params.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $_isConnected = @mysqli_real_connect(
                $this->_connection,
                $this->_config['host'],
                $this->_config['username'],
                $this->_config['password'],
                $this->_config['dbname'],
                $port
            );


This blocks the user to use flags like MYSQLI\_CLIENT\_COMPRESS and MYSQLI\_CLIENT\_SSL.
