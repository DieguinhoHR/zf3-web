ZF-8635: Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract: Duplicate methods for getParam() and getParams()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Improvement Created: 2009-12-26T11:03:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:36.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The getParam() and getParams() have duplicate methods called getUserParam() and getUserParams(), respectively. Looking at their definition, they do the same exact thing, which almost the same exact code defined twice. If anything, the getUser\* methods should just be aliases, if not removed altogether. It would help to reduce the overall code complexity, and alleviate any confusion for users (i.e., why are there two sets of methods that imply different results, but do the same things?)

They're identical in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract but differ in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http where getParams() is overridden and takes $\_GET and $\_POST into account.

I would be okay with updating the code documentation to make this subtle distinction clearer to less-experienced devs. :)

Updated priority to trivial, and changed issue type to documentation improvement.
