ZF-4842: Zend\_Exception thrown with Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase and code coverage

### Description

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase cannot be used with PHPUnit's code coverage feature.

I'm using Zend\_Framework 1.6.2 and PHPUnit 3.3.3.

Regrettably, PHPUnit\_Util\_Report\_Node\_File attempts to override a property called \_\_liHtml on line 300. This triggers a Zend\_Exception on line 71 of Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase.

It seems that either PHPUnit needs to be cleaner about its use of class properties, or Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase needs to check more than just the property name to see if the property being overridden is truly non-public. In this case, PHPUnit is violating Zend Framework naming conventions, but aside from that, the "Overloading of non-public properties is prohibited" exception is actually incorrect, since the property _is_ public, but does not follow the ZF convention.
