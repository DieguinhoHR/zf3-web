### Description

Currently there is no way to override the default view helper class prefix ("Zend\_") when using Conventional Modular Directory Structure with Zend\_Controller\_Action::initView().

You can always override initView() to allow specifying a different class prefix. Additionally, I've added the ability to pass a class prefix to each of addBasePath() and setBasePath(); when using these, pass the base prefix, minus the '\_Helper' and '\_Filter' portions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Sets helper prefixes to Module_Helper and filter prefixes to Module_Filter:
    $view->addBasePath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../views', 'Module');


Additionally, initView() only initializes the view object if the action controller view property is not already set. So, you may at any point prior to calling initView() initialize the view yourself:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function init()
    {
        $this->view = new Zend_View(
            'basePath' => dirname(__FILE__) . '/../views',
            'basePathPrefix' => 'Module_View'
        );
    }


Finally, you can always specify the base path and prefix yourself anytime after the view has been initialized:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function indexAction()
    {
        $this->initView();
        $this->view->addBasePath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../views', 'Module_View');
        $this->render();
    }


This effectively overwrites the previously set paths and associates the class prefix to use.

I am working on a view action helper that would simplify this somewhat, but there's no need to do so at this point in the action controller as there are already methods to override it.
