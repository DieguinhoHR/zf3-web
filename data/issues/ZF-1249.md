ZF-1249: Incorrect default parameter value in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql::lastInsertId()
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-04-11T13:43:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.3 (05/May/07)

### Description

In a previous revision, the default value for the $primaryKey parameter was 'id'. It appears that this has inadvertently been changed to 'null' in the current revision. This only affects Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql; the Abstract adapter class, and other concrete adapters, still have the value 'id' as the default for this parameter.

This is causing a lot of breakage in my code, and it's just a quick, one-line change to fix it. The attached patch implements the fix.

I don't agree that the best default is "id", for several reasons.

There are two solutions:

- Naming the primary key column explicitly.
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    lastInsertId($table, $pk)


- Name the sequence explicitly:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    lastSequenceId("{$table}_{$pk}_seq")


The name "id" is not a good choice for a default because it's not a recommended practice to use "id" is the name of the primary key column in database tables.
