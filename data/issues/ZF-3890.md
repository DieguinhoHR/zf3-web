### Description

The php manuel means the following on function fgetcsv: Note: Locale setting is taken into account by this function. If LANG is e.g. en\_US.UTF-8, files in one-byte encoding are read wrong by this function.

To fix this problem a new option (e.g. encoding) is needed and before fgetcsv will call you have to change the locale encoding to the given encoding if this option is set. After reading the csv file reset the locale configuration.

This issue can not be fixed due to a PHP problem. We can not set the locale as we then would loose our locale-awareness.

We added a note describing the problem. Have to wait until PHP 6 for a fix. :-(
