### Description

The Makefile for the documentation directories is not built to clean up everything, which really slows down the process of recompiling the HTML docs sometimes.

For example, entities.ent is not cleaned - and it should.

Also, it would be nice to also add a 'make distclean' option that also cleans the config files.

Resolved in revision 4165. That puts it in ZF 0.9.1 beta release.
