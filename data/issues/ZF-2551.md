ZF-2551: Posiibility to add cusomized DisplagGroup

### Description

Maybe I am wrong, but it seems that there is no way to extend Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup and then add it to Zend\_Form. Currently the addDisplayGroup() instantiates Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup. It might be helpful to add the possibility to pass the prefix and the path where the extended class can be found as optional arguments of addDisplayGroup() or as additional keys of $options array. The other way could be using Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader class and setting custom DisplayGroups location during Zend\_Form instantiation exactly as for custom Element classes.

This is partially possible now in current trunk. It does not include any possibility of using the PluginLoader functionality, but you can specify a class to use for a display group either globally for the given form, or for an individual group:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // all display groups:
    $form->setDefaultDisplayGroupClass('My_Custom_DisplayGroup');
    
    // single display group:
    $form->addDisplayGroup(array('foo', 'bar'), 'foobar', array('displayGroupClass' => 'My_Custom_DisplayGroup'));


Both examples require that the class has either been loaded already or that it uses standard ZF naming conventions.

I will likely add additional capabilities for adding display groups in the future, including adding concrete display group instances and the ability to specify paths to display groups via a PluginLoader, so I will leave this ticket open to track that.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
