### Description

This patch: <http://temp.dklab.ru/Memcached.php.patch.txt> adds the support of $weights parameter to memcached backend.

Documentation at [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://php.net/manual/en/function.memcache-addserver.php) says: weight Number of buckets to create for this server which in turn control its probability of it being selected. The probability is relative to the total weight of all servers.

This is quite useful in heavy-loaded projects. Note that DEFAULT\_WEIGHT = 1 is brought from PHP memcache extension source code and correct.

Could you please apply it in a next ZF release?

Solved in SVN r13367. I add not only the weight, but also timeout, retry\_interval and status. I assumed the value of timeout to be 5 seconds.
