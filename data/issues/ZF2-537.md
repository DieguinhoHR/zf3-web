### Description

Zend Framework 2.0 is said to be based on PHP 5.3. But I found that it is using PHP 5.4 feature 'traits' in the file: `zf2/library/Zend/EventManager/ProvidesEvents.php`. Is it a mistake or should we expect more such PHP 5.4 related features, which is not usable in PHP version 5.3?

This is not an issue, as this one is not _using_ traits, but is a trait itself to be used within your PHP 5.4 application. It does not break anything when you don't use it.

Saji -- we're providing some forwards-compatible features for 5.4. However, internally, we are not using them within the framework; they are merely there for the convenience of those who are using 5.4 for their applications. We will be providing a number of traits going forward, but, as noted, not consuming them directly within the framework.

Ben, and Matthew, Thanks for the clarifications.
