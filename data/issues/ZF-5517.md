I find that Zend\_Validate\_File\_\* don't support 'messages'options element but Zend\_Validate\_\* do. I think this can be improved.

What do you mean with 'messages' option? There is no 'messages' option as the messages in all validators are actually static.

This may be changed in future but we have no timeframe for it.

Closing issue due to no response from the reporter.

Note: All file filters are extended the same way as all other validators like Between, Int and so on. So they will support the same features like all other validators.
