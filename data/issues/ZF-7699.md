If you would like to see such a feature, I strongly urge you to create a proposal in the wiki detailing the API. As it is, this is much too big a feature to track in the issue tracker alone, and requires a separate component proposal.

Marking as "won't fix" as no other resolution really fits it. This does not mean we will not accept a Sphinx component, but merely that it is beyond the scope of the issue tracker.
