### Description

If you have a chain of custom routes there is no way for the specific routes to know whether they are the last route in the chain or not during matching. We do some validation in custom routes in the chain, but this should only be done if the route doing the validation is the last in the chain.

This can be fixed with a small change to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain::match():

$res = $route->match($match, true);

can be changed to:

$res = $route->match($match, true, ($key == $numRoutes - 1));

where $numRoutes is count($this->\_routes).

Routes wanting to use this information can expand the signature to match() in the custom route classes.

I have commit rights and have a working copy with attached tests and can commit if the feature is accepted.
