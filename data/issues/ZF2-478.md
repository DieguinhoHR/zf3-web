### Description

According to [Form Quick Start](http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/modules/zend.form.quick-start.html) it is recommended to create fieldset with common elements such as submit button, csrf elements, etc. But doing so yields an error Uncaught exception 'Zend\\Session\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException' with message 'Name passed to container is invalid; must consist of alphanumerics, backslashes and underscores only'
