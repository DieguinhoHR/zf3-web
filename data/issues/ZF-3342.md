### Description

Documentaion should display for example "available since ZendFramework version X.Y.Z" for newly added features. It would be helpful for people who doesn't download ZF on every build. On hosted enviroment, one can't bother the admin to update every minor release and it causes confusion and disappointment when feature is not available in whichever release.

We'll be versioning the documentation soon, but only by minor release. This should be fine, since there will be no new features in between minor releases. Hosting admins will have to update the documentation, or they can simply link to our hosted docs.

@Wil

Hi,

I believe this issue has been addressing the thing I'm still missing today. In [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.coding-style.html) there is a requirement for PHPDoc @since attribute to files and classes (I'd love to see @since for public methods as well), but I can't manage to find any @since specified in the code.

And yes, I'm reading your hosted docs, and there is also no clue since when a File|Class|Method has been available. I still prefer to read the latest version and be up-to-date with the latest features, with comfort of knowing that if for any reasons I'm stuck with ZF 1.7.6 on a single project I can't count on e.g. Zend\_Navigation, without having to read release notes for all versions.

Cheers v.

The point is not, that I don't see in documentation since when it's there because it out of date, Will. The point is there is NO CHANCE of finding this information other then comparing versions of documentation/source and finding the one where the feature first appears.
