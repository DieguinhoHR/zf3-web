ZF-2432: Zend\_Validate validators do not all set messages
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-01-14T13:11:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T16:25:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

A number of Zend\_Validate concrete validators do not currently set the $\_messages array on a failed isValid() call, which means that if you call getMessages() after a failed validation, it may return an empty result. This is problematic when using a validator chain (such as Zend\_Validate, or the new Zend\_Form component), as the results of getMessages() becomes unpredictable.

Validators known to be missing this functionality include: \* Digits \* Alnum

Additionally, it would be useful to have the returned array use the error code for the key, such that getMessages() would return array( CODE => ).

Would you please provide some test data from which I can reproduce the behavior of getMessages() returning an empty array for each of the above listed classes? Thanks! :)

I haven't been able to reproduce the described problem with getMessages() not returning validation failure messages for either listed class, but I have added unit tests to cover the case for some basic input.

I am making the change that getMessages() returns an array such that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    assert($validator->getErrors() === array_keys($validator->getMessages()));


This allows us to deprecate the superfluous getErrors() method from the validation interface.

Resolving as cannot reproduce, having committed [SVN r7450](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=7450).
