### Description

This is a very strange issue I've been experiencing. For some reason the value of Submit buttons is not available to PHP when using Firefox (tested with Mac version 2.0.0.13 or PC version 1.5.0.10).

To recreate build a form such as:

Output result on postback with print\_r($\_POST)

You will notice the submit button does not return a value.

I can't completely issolate that this is Zend framework but I've tried the same code on a different server. I've also built a standard non-zend php page and do not witness this behavior.

I should have stated that this is using the Zend MVC framework.

This is not a Zend Framework issue; please file a report with the browser vendor.
