It took me 20 tries to get the CAPTCHA right so I could sign up for this bug tracker. Not kidding. TWENTY TRIES. Please use a CAPTCHA method that doesn't blur all the text into meaningless black blobs.

I vote for figlet, that one is much more readable and still perfectly secure.

I'll need to push this upstream to Atlassian; the captcha for the issue tracker is part of JIRA.
