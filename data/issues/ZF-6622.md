Hm, looking at the documentation, it should actually be === false.

Well that won't work either since the value taken from memory is just a '0', == false will do the trick

Ah yeah, sorry, was confused for a moment, but we are writing "1" into the semaphore, so we should check for that if I'm not wrong.
