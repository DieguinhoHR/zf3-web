ZF-2061: Add a seal() method to Zend\_Config
--------------------------------------------

### Description

I tried to use the new merge() method, but had the problem, that our main config object was read-only. Adding allowModifications to the Zend\_Config constructor was easy, but now it's also writable outside of our front-controller. It would be nice if Zend\_Config could be sealed (setting Zend\_Config::\_allowModifications to false) after the init phase.

I like the idea of post-construction configurability, but I would instead recommend the solution to be adding a setAllowModifications(boolean $enabled) method or similar, though maybe there is better name for $enabled.

setAllowModifications() implies that a Zend\_Config object can be made writable at will.

Maybe something like setReadOnly() so that it's a one-way operation ?

I also think disallowing modifications should be one-way as it's something you'd do to enforce code standards. The name (seal() or setReadOnly()) doesn't matter to me.

If I understand correctly, this is trivially accomplished by extending Zend\_Config:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyConfig extends Zend_Config
    {
        public function seal()
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
            return $this;
        }
    }


Considering the above comments and the fact that it could also be harmful to allow only seal()/setReadOnly() - many people would have the opposite problem (needing write access to a locked object) - it would seem that this is best done in userland instead of bloating the framework component with possibly problematic functionality.

It's not that easy because you need to apply the change recursively. And that's currently not possible because \_\_construct() and \_\_set() use new Zend\_Config instead of new self and therefor all childs won't have a seal method.

Yes, of course, I missed that. What would the implementation look like, now that I committed [SVN r6767](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6767)?

Hi Nico,

Does Darby's change in SVN r6767 allow you to solve your problem if you write the userland class :

 
    <pre class="highlight">class MyConfig extends Zend_Config
    {
        public function seal()
        {
            $this->_allowModifications = false;
            return $this;
        }
    }

I'd like to resolve this issue one way or another if possible.

Choices are:

1. Resolve as "Won't Fix" or "Not an Issue" and users will have to create a user-land class.
2. Add a setReadOnly() function to Zend\_Config.

Personally, I'm tending towards (2) as merging multiple config files into a single Zend\_Config doesn't strike me as that unusual a use-case and with merge() we are implicitly endorsing this use-case anyway. May as well tidy up after ourselves!

Thoughts?

Added setReadOnly() in [svn 6967](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6967) on the trunk and [svn 6968](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6968) on the release-1.0 branch.
