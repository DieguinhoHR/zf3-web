### Description

When I upgraded to Zend 1.8, a new issue arose. The call to inet\_pton() in line 62 fails when attempting to validate "localhost". I know the error is suppressed and I can set my error handler to ignore it, but it still seems like it would be a common error to incur. It seems like it would be a better solution to avoid the error entirely since "localhost" should be regarded as valid
