### Description

"Zend\_Measure::" should be removed from constant definitions to be consistent with other ZF components constant definitions.

Constant definitions should not contain the name of the class prefixing the value of string constants containing a value the same as the name of the class.

This brakes existing code/API for detection of the type which is actual optional.

Is this a whished behaviour ?

Ok... reworked this and changed all constant contents. Unit tests approve but changes were not rethought in detail because of the release 0.7.

Docu needs to be rewritten on this change !
