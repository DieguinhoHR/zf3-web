### Description

i love the way zend\_view does it's magic, but for me, it's missing the biggest magical trick. i would like to be able to create a form object, and to define i want 2 text objects with limits and ascii ranges and then just send this object and the target action to zend\_view to brake it down for me to elements, and then, when i get the data back, to have automatic validation of the form's data and in case of an error to render me a new form and so on. this will save so much repetative coding for me it would be a killer feature. and i guess it would be extendable to ajax-like includes and other dynamic dhtml would be implementable via models and so on. what do you think?

There are several proposals in process that would address this:

- [Zend\_FilterChain and Zend\_Validator](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_FilterChain+Zend_Validator+-+Christopher+Thompson)
- [Zend\_Form](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3596)
- [Zend\_Form\_Controller](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Form_Controller+Proposal+-+Simon+Mundy)

This is not a simple feature addition, and should go through the proposal process. If you would like to help contribute, please contact the authors of these proposals and see how you can help.
