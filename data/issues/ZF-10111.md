ZF-10111: MimeType fails to validate more than one files from form
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

1. I transmit two files from the form:
2. FileInfo gets an array of two elements: array(2) { ["files\_0\_"] => array(11) { ["name"] => ... ["type"] => ... } ["files\_1\_"] => array(11) { ["name"] => ... ["type"] => ... } }
3. Validator Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType fail to validate second file with the message: Message: No property exists by the name '\_finfo'
4. The reason is the 'unset($this->\_finfo);' operator in line 347 of isValid() function. Class validates first file, then kills '\_finfo' variable and fails to pass second. If I comment this line, validation pass both files.

And another thing about this issue... For each pass code above the line 347 reopens mimefile. Why don't to use one created in constructor?

Please give some code to reproduce your problem.

There is no unset within Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType on that lines or near them. isValid is unset-free.

Closing as duplicate. Issue seems to be fixed by another issue as there is no unset()
