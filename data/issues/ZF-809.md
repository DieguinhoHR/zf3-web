### Description

The dispatcher methods \_getController(), \_getAction(), and \_getDefaultController() methods are currently protected making it impossible to use them in plugins (where they could be used to verify that a controller and action pair are dispatchable, or test for the controller class and modify it based on ACLs). Making them public would provide more flexibility, as well as make test coverage easier.
