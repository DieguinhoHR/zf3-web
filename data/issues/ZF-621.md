### Description

Unit test code coverage reporting breaks after I run tests/Zend/Cache/FileBackendTest.php.

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File class performs a chdir() to the cache directory in the \_clean() function, but it does not restore the working directory to its previous location after it does its work. So relative pathnames used in the PHP application are inaccessible.

This issue manifests in unit testing when we try to generate the code coverage report, specifying a relative path to the directory containing the report HTML files. For example:

phpunit --report "html" AllTests.php

All tests following the run of FileBackendTest.php get errors, because they are not able to open files in the relative path to the report directory.

I'm able to work around this issue by specifying an absolute pathname for the report output directory. So I'm downgrading this issue from Blocker to Major.

But phpunit fails when using an output directory containing spaces in the name, even if I quote the command-line argument. So this is still pretty inconvenient.

I just commited into SVN a modification of the clean() method of the file backend (without chdir)

can you try it ?
