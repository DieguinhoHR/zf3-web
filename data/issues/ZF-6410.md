### Description

DomQuery doesn't seem to be working properly for HTML fragments where the body tag is not present...

<?php require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload();

$path = 'body'; $content = '

No Body Tag
===========

';

$constraint = new Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Constraint\_DomQuery($path);

var\_dump ( $constraint->evaluate($content, 'assertNotQuery') );

//expected output : bool(true) //actual output: bool(false)

This is actually a problem with how the DOM extension works when importing HTML documents. For some reason, DOMDocument::loadHTML() creates a BODY element if none is found. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do about this.

Issue is upstream in the PHP DOM extension; closing as "won't fix"
