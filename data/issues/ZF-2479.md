### Description

For some of the info under a form is required multilangual text.

Let's name just select case (male / female) or for submit buttons text (Submit over english but diff name for other languages)...

So must be a easy way to do multilanguage side for this.

This is stated also on today's talks over fw-mvc.

This should be for config based forms.

This doesn't seems to work for submit buttons.
