### Description

count() method returns overall number of documents including deleted documents.

So it's possible to get real number of documents only after full index optimization. It's necessary to have method for retrieving number of non-deleted documents.

Done.

$index->numDocs() may be used to retrieve number of non-deleted documents. $index->maxDoc() returns one greater than the largest possible document number (synonym for $index->count()).
