### Description

In the documentation (documentation/manual/en/module\_specs tree) chapter: 12.7.1. Controllers, something similar to the following can be added:

12.7.1.4 Custom Plugins Registration

The partial configuration below shows how to register custom plugins with the PluginLoader in the module configuration file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array(
       'di' => array(
            'instance' => array(
                'Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginLoader' => array(
                    'parameters' => array(
                        'map' => array(
                            'custom' => 'SomeCustomModule\CustomPlugin',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
       ),
    );
