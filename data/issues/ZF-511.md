### Description

The framework standard is that the first letter of an acronym is capitalized and all subsequent letters are lowercase. See Zend\_Acl, Zend\_Http, Zend\_Json, Zend\_Pdf, Zend\_Uri, Zend\_XmlRpc, Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite, etc. Therefore, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_MySQLi should be Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli.
