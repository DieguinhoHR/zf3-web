### Description

Mssql.php

line 74:

$dsn = 'mssql' . ':' . implode(';', $dsn);

Please use better commented version from line 73: $dsn = $this->\_pdoType . ':' . implode(';', $dsn);

Otherwise, since for some platphorms pdoType is in fact dblib instead of mssql we need to re-work entire function.

If you replacing with format from line 73 will work with just a simple replacement of protected $\_pdoType = 'mssql';
