### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscovery documentation was merged into one 'sect1' section.

So it was necessary to update manual.xml.in files to keep them in a consistent state (otherwise it broke build for the languages which didn't have Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscovery documentation translated).

That, in turn, required French documentation section for Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscovery to be merged.

It made 'fr/module\_specssZend\_Soap\_AutoDiscovery.xml' file newer than 'en/module\_specssZend\_Soap\_AutoDiscovery.xml' so it's not presented by the [Documentation status](http://framework.zend.com/manual/status) page as 'need to be translated".

This issue is created to check if French Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscovery documentation needs update.
