### Description

I have disabled the usage of different parameters in cache key generation $frontendOptions = array( 'lifetime' => 60 \* 60 \* 3, 'default\_options' => array( 'cache' => true, 'cache\_with\_get\_variables' => false, 'cache\_with\_post\_variables' => false, 'cache\_with\_session\_variables' => false, 'cache\_with\_files\_variables' => false, 'cache\_with\_cookie\_variables' => false, 'make\_id\_with\_get\_variables' => false, 'make\_id\_with\_post\_variables' => false, 'make\_id\_with\_session\_variables' => false, 'make\_id\_with\_files\_variables' => false, 'make\_id\_with\_cookie\_variables' => false ), 'regexps' => array( '/public/secure' => array( 'cache' => false ) ) );

but in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page.\_makePartialId when for example if cache\_with\_XXX and make\_id\_with\_XXX are false but the variable has value, for example, I have some cookies set than the following code in the mentioned method

if (count($var) > 0) { return false; }

returns false which disables the cache

is it a correct behavior? I supposed that when they are disabled, I should be able to cache any way, shouldn't I?

This is a correct behavior.

If you set cache\_with\_XXX\_variable to false the cache is disabled if this global variable is set.
