### Description

This is maybe related to ZF-9606.

It seems to be impossible to read and write terms of documents when run under linux 32bit.

I've got a script to create a lucene index and a lucene search functionality within my website. During development on a Win 7, 64bit machine everything works fine. However when I try to search something on my production system, which is linux 32bit, nothing is ever returned. When I rebuild the index on that machine the documents get added fine, but without any terms whatsoever. I checked that with Luke (Java Lucene Index Toolbox).

I applied the patch from ZF-9606, but that didn't help. The results are the same as before.

Can you please provide some information about each system? (ie: OS ver (dist+kernel), PHP ver, etc) Thanks!
