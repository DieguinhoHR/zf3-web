### Description

Hi,

since PHP 5.4 an E\_NOTICE is thrown in Zend\_Validate\_Abstract on line 233 (and 268) because of this cast when $value is an array: ````

Could be please also say if this is going to be fixed in ZF 1.x or maybe only 2.x ?

Thanks in advance Rene

Hi,

I don't want to bump this, but altough the related issue is marked as fixed, this issue has not been solved yet. The mentioned array-to-string cast is still being performed.

Greetings Rene
