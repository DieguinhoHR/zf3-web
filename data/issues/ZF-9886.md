### Description

If to specify connection option Zend\_Db::CASE\_FOLDING => CASE\_LOWER, it doesn't affect the query result. Statement remains returning upper-cased field names. Seems to be that case folding is just forgotten to be implemented.

See [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.0.0RC1/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Oracle.php), line 317: "// @todo: make use of adapter->foldCase()".
