Started checking what is the problem

I suspect a regression in Zend\_Cache, but I don't have much to back that assertion yet.

Yes, it seems that Zend\_Cache::$availableBackends was removed (same also for Zend\_Cache::$availableFrontends) in [SVN r9056](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Cache.php?r1=9056&r2=8851). These should be restored and marked as @deprecated. The next major release would be the next opportunity to actually remove these from the class.

Fixed with [SVN r9196](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=9196).
