### Description

Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface is missing the documentation for count() as of Rev12071. In Rev10200 it was:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Returns the total number of rows in the collection.
         *
         * @return integer
         */
        //public function count();

The interface is not told to redifine extended methods.

Count() is not actually in the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface source code

I realize that count() isn't actually defined, but the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Interface extends Countable, so any class implementing the Interface has to have a count() function.

The earlier versions of this file had the code above, which is in fact all commented out, but serves as a useful reminder to someone creating a class to implement the interface, that it needs have a count() function as well as getItems().
