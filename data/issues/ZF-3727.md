If you're trying to provide a custom count query, don't forget to add the zend\_paginator\_row\_count column in the columns part of the query. There's a constant for this in the DbSelect adapter class. Also, the adapter adds the limit and offset parts automatically, so there's no need to do that yourself. I'm closing this as Not an Issue. Please provide some more details if you do think this is a bug :)

I think that the offset part is not needed in counting rows. Selecting rows count with offset part will always return null if offset is greater than 0 Ex: select count(\*) from bugs LIMIT 10 OFFSET 30

Here are my actual examples:

This code throws the exception

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               $bugsTable        = new Bugs();
                $bugsRowset    = $bugsTable->find(1234);
                $bug1234          = $bugsRowset->current();
                
                $productsTable = new Products();
                $productsRowset   = $bug1234->findManyToManyRowset('Products', 'BugsProducts', null, null, $select = $productsTable->select()->limitPage(2, 10));
                
                $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($select)->
                                        setCurrentPageNumber(2)
                                            ->setItemCountPerPage(10);


The code works fine after I clear the offset limit part of the select

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $bugsTable        = new Bugs();
                $bugsRowset       = $bugsTable->find(1234);
                $bug1234          = $bugsRowset->current();
                
                $productsTable = new Products();
                $productsRowset   = $bug1234->findManyToManyRowset('Products', 'BugsProducts', null, null, $select = $productsTable->select()->limitPage(2, 10));
                
                $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($select->reset(Zend_Db_Select::LIMIT_OFFSET))->
                                        setCurrentPageNumber(2)
                                            ->setItemCountPerPage(10);
