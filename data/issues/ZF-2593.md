### Description

Revision: 7826 Class: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File Methods: \_fileGetContents, \_filePutContents Lines: 660, 668, 681, 683

In both methods flock() function is given parameters $f and $fp (??) that are nowhere declared, my guess they should be $file.

error-suppresion operator @ is successfully used to hide this error.

Here's what i get now:

Debug Warning: \\home...\\lib\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\File.php line 660 - flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, string given Debug Warning: \\home...\\lib\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\File.php line 668 - flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, string given Debug Warning: \\home...\\lib\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\File.php line 681 - flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, string given Debug Warning: \\home...\\lib\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\File.php line 683 - flock() expects parameter 1 to be resource, string given

I guess you'll have to fopen it

Also, maybe when testing, remove @ to see errors :)

Somehow cache file with size 0 was created, and when it was attempted to be read by \_fileGetContents it gave an error in $result = fread($f, $fsize); - apparently fread can't have $fsize==0
