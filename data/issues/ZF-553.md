### Description

Since Zend\_Db\_Select allows for GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to be used and Zend\_Db\_Table->\_fetch() just hands values over to Zend\_Db\_Select I think all these options should be given.

This will change function definitions for: Zend\_Db\_Table->\_fetch() Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchAll() Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchRow()

The coding itself is easy (sorry, I don't have patch software at the moment), of course. Mainly this gets added to Zend\_Db\_Table->\_fetch():

 
    <pre class="literal">
    // the GROUP BY clause
    $group = (array) $group;
    foreach ($group as $val) {
        $select->group($val);
    }
    
    // the HAVING clause
    $having = (array) $having;
    foreach ($having as $val) {
        $select->having($val);
    }


Then the calls to this function from Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchAll() and Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchRow() have to be changed, as well as the function declarations of all these functions. Even though this will break code I would like the function parameters to be in the same order as in Zend\_Db\_Select...

Cheers,

Axel

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

This feature enhancement is not compatible with the Table Data Gateway pattern.

The solution when writing special queries is to write a Select query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new MyTable();
    
    $select = $table->getAdapter()->select();
    $select->group(...);
    $select->having(...);
    $stmt = $select->query();
