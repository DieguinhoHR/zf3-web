ZF-11240: Zend\_Form + Session + create\_function

### Description

Zend\_Form cannot be stored in session and reused later, because Zend\_Form\_Element loadDeafult decorators is using:

$getId = create\_function('$decorator', 'return $decorator->getElement()->getId() . "-element";');

and anonymous lambda functions cannot be stored in session, on next render of form fetched from session we will see the following code:

It would be also good to use call\_user\_func instead of $val['callback']($this); as it wont accept static methods of a class to be passed (in Zend\_Form\_Element\_HtmlTag)

This also breaks serializing forms for caching etc. Maybe implement \_\_sleep().

A possible workaround has been provided. Zend\_Form itself is not designed to be ported around via sessions - you should transport the data instead and populate a new instance on the other end.
