### Description

Problem was originally reported by Graeme Merrall in [FW-General mailing list](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/21251):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. I'm trying to sort my search results by an alternate field named 'publication\_time'.

$results = $index->find($query, 'publication\_time', SORT\_NUMERIC, SORT\_DESC);

However, I get an error when I do. This error occurs both in 0.8.0 and the latest snapshot (20070310-3855).

Error is:

Notice: Undefined offset: 4 in /usr/local/php5/lib/ZendFramework-20070310-3855/library/Zend/Search/Lucene.php on line 585

Warning: array\_multisort() [function.array-multisort]: Argument #3 is expected to be an array or a sort flag in /usr/local/php5/lib/ZendFramework-20070310-3855/library/Zend/Search/Lucene.php on line 608

When I poke around in the code, it seems that the $sortArgs array passed to array\_multisort has had SORT\_NUMERIC set empty.

Is this a bug or have I missed something?

Cheers,

Graeme
