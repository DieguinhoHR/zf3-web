### Description

I know PHP5.3 hasn't even entered RC stage, but I wanted to start using late static binding.

Certain keywords have been added to PHP5.3, for example goto.

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector uses goto as a method name and so causes a parse error "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T\_GOTO, expecting T\_STRING"

I've attached a proposed patch to fix the problem.

It would still support backwards compatibility by using \_\_call to catch any calls to the goto method, and then calls the new method gotoAction.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.
