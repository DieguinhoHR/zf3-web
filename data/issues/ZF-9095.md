ZF-9095: Defaultencoding for Mails should be Zend\_Mime::ENCODING\_BASE64

### Description

The documentation says "The default behavior of Zend\_Mail is to assume the attachment is a binary object (application/octet-stream), that it should be transferred with base64 encoding, and that it is handled as an attachment." [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.attachments.html)]

But this isn't the case.

I think it is not an issue , because default value of 2nd and 4th parameter in createAttachment() are Zend\_Mime::TYPE\_OCTETSTREAM and Zend\_Mime::ENCODING\_BASE64 .
