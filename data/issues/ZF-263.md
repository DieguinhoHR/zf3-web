What you're asking for is to add a functionality to make Zend\_Log rotate logs, or add functionality to read splitted logs in a "rolling" form?

to make Zend\_Log rotate logs

This is really something that in most cases is deligated to the server to handle.

Rotating of logs at the application level of a web application would cause a large delay for the user that happened to hit the site and get "stuck" with the rotation action.

logrotate is a good example of handling this at the server level

Hi, I'm developing software under Linux, I know logrotate

but my software will be deployed to multiplatform... (esp windows and linux) It will be necessary to let php rotate the log, just like log4php

Reopening issue, however I don't think it should be part of "core" Zend\_Log but instead split off into a seperate Zend\_Log\_Manager type class. This way those who need this functionality can use it but no overhead is added for those that don't

Creating a new component or tool for managing log files is not related to the Zend\_Log component. I'm closing this issue as "Incomplete" because that is what we have done for JIRA issues that really should be presented in the form of a proposal on our wiki.
