### Description

Usage of oci\_bind\_array\_by\_name function not implemented in _\_bindParam()_ method. When $parameter is array, function _oci\_bind\_array\_by\_name_ should be called (not oci\_bind\_by\_name).

I think that oci\_bind\_array\_by\_name can only be used with the stored procedures and therefore is not useful for the nosrmal select/delete/update statements. Current implementation is correct and that should not be noted as an issue.
