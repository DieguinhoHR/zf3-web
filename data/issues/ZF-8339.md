### Description

The autoloader needs to be updated to follow the guidelines outlined by the PHP Interoperability Group, per the following page: [http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards/web/psr-0-final-proposal)

This will also provide us with an autoloader capable of loading code using actual PHP namespaces, though we will likely wait to push full support until we have a better idea of how the resource autoloader will work in 2.0.

@Matthew,

This was implemented in 1.10 (for the basic autoloader at least) -- shouldn't this ticket be closed?
