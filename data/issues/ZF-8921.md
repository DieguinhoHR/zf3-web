ZF-8921: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row: Creating a row and deleting it does not work

### Description

In a UnitTest an (invoice) row object is begin created and deleted shortly after that.

$invoiceobj = new Invoice(); $invoice = $invoiceobj->createRow($data); $invoice->save(); ... $invoice->delete();

This however does not work - the resulting query: DELETE FROM `invoices` WHERE (id = '`invoices`.`id` = 21'); does not delete the line.

The workaround: $object->getTable()->delete($object->id); works well - the row is being removed.
