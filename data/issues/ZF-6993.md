### Description

Currently, type conversion in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client is broken, it doesn't work for all types and yields strange results sometimes. The attached patch fixes the behavior and allows us to convert to every type.

Patch to fix type conversion behavior

Better patch including a unit test to verify the behavior. The idea is, that if there is a server signature, we _always_ try to convert the given arguments before passing them to the server. This means I can call a remote method like - printNumber(int num)

with 1. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::call('printNumber', '3') 2. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::call('printNumber', 3) 3. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::call('printNumber', 3.0) 4. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::call('printNumber', array('3')) 5. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client::call('printNumber', array(3))

etc.pp. you get the idea. Current behavior is, that we get an signature missmatch, because our use case 1) will pass '3' as a string to the server.
