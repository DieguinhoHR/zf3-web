### Description

Hector Virgen [writes @ fw-mvc](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Validate-consistancy-to14695555s16154.html):

If it's not too much to ask, can we have some consistency in the values for the constants in the Zend\_Validate classes?

Some of them have the class name in the constant value, while others don't.

For example, Zend\_Validate\_StringLength::TOO\_LONG is 'stringLengthTooLong', while Zend\_Validate\_Between::NOT\_BETWEEN is 'notBetween'.

This probably wouldn't be a big issue but when creating validators for Zend\_Filter\_Input I find myself having to reference the API often to find the actual constant value when creating custom error messages:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validators = array(
       'search'        => array(
       'presence'      => 'required',
       array('StringLength', 2, 96),
           'messages'      => array(
               array(
                   'stringLengthTooShort' =>
                       'Your search query must be at least %min% characters in length.',
                   'stringLengthTooLong' =>
                       'Your search query may not be greater than %max% characters in length.',
               )
           )
       )
    )


Thank you.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
