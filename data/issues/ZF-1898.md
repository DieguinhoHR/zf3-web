ZF-1898: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::toArray returns a reference to data instead of an array of data

### Description

Bill, I am noticing circular references when I try to return an array:

Ponder this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $thing = new ArrayObject($row->toArray(), ArrayObject::ARRAY_AS_PROPS);
    $thing->foo= 'bar';


Also adds foo = bar into the \_data of the $row.

Perhaps toArray() shoudl cast \_data to (Array) before returning it?

Yes, ArrayObject's constructor make a reference on the variable passed to it. Casting to array before returning, explicitly tells PHP to make a real copy (not a COW) of the returned array.

See the first comment at [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ArrayObject-construct.php)

I don't know if this sould be considered as a ZF issue, or a PHP issue, it's actually confused, as you can read in that bug report : <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42065>

I agree that toArray() should return a copy, rather than a reference to the object's properties. A change to a member of the returned value of toArray() that results in changes to the object data seems like unintended behavior.

Since this would be a slight BC break, however, and because I would like to hear Bill's comments on the issue, I remove 1.0.2 from fix version list.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

I cant reproduce on PHP5.2.5, seems to have been fixed in 5.2.4 but not tested :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $a = array('foo'=>'bar');
    $arrayobject = new ArrayObject($a,ArrayObject::ARRAY_AS_PROPS);
    $arrayobject->foo = 'foobar';
    assert($a['foo'] == 'foobar'); // fails on 5.2.5


if you pass a reference $arrayObject (&$a) , then assertion pass (and a logical call-time pass reference warning appears)

Please confirm, I have a patch for that issue (if necessary).

Actually, this behavior is not documented here:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.row.html#zend.db.table.row.read.to-array)

I think now this should be fixed for the next mini-release.

I confirm that this is a PHP issue that comes out in PHP <= 5.2.3 (fixed in 5.2.4) please refer to <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42065> for more informations.

So it needs to be patched, and won't BC anything

I'm on it.
