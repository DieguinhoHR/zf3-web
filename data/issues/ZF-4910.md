Hello, Benoit. [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.rest.client.html)

In 37.2.3. Request Arguments, I can expect as following. The string , "method=arg&arg1=value1&arg=value1&arg2=value2" is made from $client->arg('value1')->arg2('value2')->get() .

Do you mean a string , "method=arg&arg0=value1&arg=value1" should be made from $client->arg('value1')->get() ?

Hello!

Sorry I should have put more details

Currently $client->arg('value1')->get(); gives method=arg&arg1=value1 and it should be method=arg&arg0=value1 because of the way Zend\_Rest\_Server builds the arguments list.

The problem arise when the server-side method have the first argument of the function optional. When Zend\_Rest\_Server builds the arguments list used to call the function, the first argument's value becomes the default one (Zend/Rest/Server.php:167) and a second argument gets created because of arg1 passed in the query (Zend/Rest/Server.php:174). If the argument was named arg0 it would overwrite the default value.

I can send you a complete example if needed.

Ben

Hello, Benoit.

I think there may be problem in Zend\_Rest\_Server rather than Zend\_Rest\_Client.

Because the number of arguments should be started from 1.

cf. the item "Numeric index" of [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.rest.server.html)

Anyway, I will research more detail on handle() function of Zend\_Rest\_Server.

This would be a backwards compatibility breakage to change at this point. While cardinal numbers should have been used in the original implementation, they were not, and changing them at this point would break functionality for those using the server.

Hi, Matthew, thank You for Your judgement.
