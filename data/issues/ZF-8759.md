### Description

Currently Zend\_Auth::hasIdentity() with default Zend\_Auth\_Storage\_Session starts session even if session obviously doesn't exist (no COOKIE and session id param in request).

It causes session to start on each request, which is something you'd like to avoid in many cases. I propose first to check if Zend\_Session::sessionExists() in methods "isEmpty" and "read" of Zend\_Auth\_Storage\_Session and only then actually start the session.

Hello,

I agree with this improvement, Zend\_Auth::hasIdentity() shouldn't start a new session if it doesn't exists. However, I suggest to modify directly the method Zend\_Auth::hasIdentity() as below, because the session is created during the instanciation of the Zend\_Auth\_Storage\_Session, in the method Zend\_Auth::getStorage().

public function hasIdentity() { if (null !== $this->\_storage) { return !$this->getStorage()->isEmpty(); } return false; }

Regards, Emmanuel

I totally agree. It's neccessery with bigger projects. I have project, and there is about 1 million session files, and it's critical for server. And 90% of sessions are empty (only started by Zend\_Auth)...
