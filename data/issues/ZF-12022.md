### Description

In [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.navigation.containers.html) under "Example #4 Removing pages from a container", line 21 of the example is incorrect. It reads;

$page3 = $container->findOneByAction('Page 3');

'Page 3' is the label not the action. The Action is 'page3'. So it should read;

$page3 = $container->findOneByAction('page3');
