### Description

I think it is usefull get the timezone by the locale region or by the default region of a given language e.g: de\_DE => DE => Europe/Berlin de\_AT => AT => Europe/Vienna en => GB => Europe/London (using the default region or throw an Exception)

the information is stored in the file Zend/Locale/Data/supplementalData.xml

There are a few things to mention:

- The timezones are not standardized. Which means that they do not correspond with php's timezone database.
- The avaiable localized data for timezones is not complete. Several timezones are not filled within the multiple languages.
- Timezones differ between windows and unix or php. For example the windows timezone "africa\_central" is unknown in php.
- Localized/Normalized timezones will probably not work with Zend\_Date
- Giving the timezone for a locale could be problematic... for example the locale "en"... it would support about 20 different timezones... which to return ??
- Also what to return if there are different supported timezones... for example within "zh\_CN" or "ru\_RU"

ok it need a matching table to parse timezones to the right format.

for only a given locale it can throw an exception, but on a given country code it can return a list of available timezones for this country. Than the timezone can relatively well Concerts.

The possible and available information have been implemented within the new I18N core. See SVN-7357.
