ZF-9274: Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl connection timeout should be set during write instead of initialization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Since the correction was made to use CURLOPT\_CONNECTTIMEOUT the timeout setting is not persisting between requests using the same curl handle. This value needs to be set during the Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl::write() method instead of Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl::connect(). Here is a diff which makes the appropriate change for version 1.10.2
