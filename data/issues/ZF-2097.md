    <pre class="highlight">

        'host'     => '127.0.0.1',
        'username' => 'webuser',
        'password' => 'xxxxxxxx',
        'dbname'   => 'test'
    ));
    
    $userName = 'jo';
    $password = 'xyzzy';
    
    $stmt = $db->prepare('CALL authenticate_user(?, ?)');
    $stmt->bindParam(1, $userName);
    $stmt->bindParam(2, $password);
    $stmt->execute();
    $result = $stmt->fetch();


The bindParam statements call \_bindParam in Zend/Db/Statement/Mysqli.php, which have nothing more than a 'return true;' statement. It does not appear the Mysqli bind\_param function is implemented - is this correct?? If so does anyone have any workarounds for using stored procedures in MySql 5.1??

Using the PDO\_MYSQL driver does not help as it has a problem calling 2 stored procedures back-to-back (throws the 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active.' error, which has been discussed before)... {quote}

Zend\_Db\_Statement\_MysqliTest tests bound parameters with regular queries but not with stored procedures.

Also check to see where else these tests should appear.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

There appears to be major issues with the Mysqli adapter - the Pdo\_Mysql has been resolved. Leaving open until next major version to see if any core PHP issues are related to this.
