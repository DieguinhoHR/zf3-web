### Description

There is a inconsistency in case-sensitivity between the autoloading of helpers and their retrieval from PriorityStack.

e.g. If a helper is called "Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_SideBar", but is defined in a file called "Sidebar.php" (upper case "B" vs. lower case "b"), Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader will load the class o.k. because class\_exists is case insensitive. However, Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker\_PriorityStack's \_\_get method will not find the helper as it uses array\_key\_exists (which is case sensitive) to query its internal array of helpers.

The above scenario results in a fatal error.

Not sure this is really an issue. It's documented that loading helpers are case sensitive with a lowercase first letter.

It is (or was, in 1.7 at least) an issue because the framework is generating a fatal error rather than handling the problem gracefully. Either throw an error at the time the plugin is loaded or explicitly check for this situation in \_\_get and raise an exception there.
