This feature can not be so hard to fix!

imap\_rfc822\_parse\_adrlist alternative ;)

Hi, Thomas.

This issue is still alive?

As far as I know there is still no way of doing this without using imap\_rfc822\_parse\_adrlist.

Please do correct me if I am mistaken

What has this to do with Zend\_Mime?

Isnt that more an issue for Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap?

I can't see the value besides being an alternative for an already existing function in PHP core/extensions.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.zendcomponents.html) as you can see there Zend\_Mail does not rely on any php extensions and thats how its supposed to be!

I guess it would fit into the Zend\_Mail or the Zend\_Mime. since it is also interessting for Pop and other protocols someone would have to say where it belongs

This is not critical.

Sorry, this method can't handel some correct address like: "Huber, Hans" [hans.huber@domain.com](mailto:hans.huber@domain.com)

But I would love to see this function in Zend\_Mail!
