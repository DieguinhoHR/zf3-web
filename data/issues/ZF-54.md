----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-20T01:08:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.1 (23/Mar/07)

### Description

Apparently, there is not adequate error-handling in the db component (Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract?). If MySQL is not running, the query() method throws an uncaught PDOException that is not a very graceful way to give up the ghost! The controlling method should be incorporated with the error-handling logic.

This was resolved in ZF-1031, in revision 4202. Thus it was included in ZF 0.9.1.
