### Description

Currently, once plugins are registered with the front controller, there's no way to retrieve them. As a result, if you no longer have the plugin object in scope, you cannot unregister it.

To correct these issues, I propose:

- Add an accessor to retrieve all plugins
- Add an accessor to retrieve plugins my class name; would return either a single object or array of objects
- Alter unregisterPlugin() to accept an optional class name; it would then unregister all plugins of that class.
