### Description

Hello there!

As far as i understand, the Zend Framework should be an Enterprise-Framework, that is controlled by the Company Zend. Enterprise means huge PHP5-Application, that may have todo a lot of DB-Querys and a lot of calculations from DB and PHP site. And a lot of those DB Querys may return the same result and may take a lot of time over-and-over. And for this "Problem" i wanna make a suggestion:

A new method should be added like '$db->enableCache(true/false);'. In case the flag is off ( by default ), the Class is working like the current System. But in case the Cache is enabled, it should be handled in an different way. All select-Query results should be automaticaly stored ( serialized ) in an local file on the server ( file destination maybe can be set in the attribute to enable the cache). In case an result was found in the file, return this result, in case not, query the DB and store the results and return them to the user. In case an UPDATED/INSERT/DELETE/etc. Query is executed, the cache results, that are now out-of-date with this query, should be removed too and than on the server. Such a system can performa an Application a lot.

Maybe you guys also find a way to make the Cache System workable on Application, that use Mirror-Servers/Multiple-Databases for the same application, so cache is up-to-date with all of them. Of course, the end-user ( the developer ), shouldn't notice anything or shouldn't have todo more, then enabling the Cache. The Class should completly autohandle it.

I think this suggestion would be very usfull. Thomas

What would this offer beyond the query caches already included with many RDBMS?

This trades the query cache system in a RDBMS for a different caching system (e.g. local file-based, or memcache).

With the use of MVC, there are other abstractions to consider caching, including logical models constructed from processing data retrieved from the DB.

Cache expiration becomes problematic. When to expire what data in the cache?

If all DB commits pass through the cache system logic first, then the cache can mark items "dirty". If not, then we need some other approach, such as TTL (time-to-live) which result in "imperfect" results (stale data returned by the cache).

You can simply check it based on the table name. For caching on localy file, you can use a permanent SQLite Connection.

Here an example script ( this is an extension for the PEAR::DB Class ) that i wrote some time ago: [[http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php/â€¦](http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=357)] [[http://schulermanager.at/pear/DB\_cache\_pgsql.phps](http://schulermanager.at/pear/DB_cache_pgsql.phps)]

You can use the same system/idea here.

I think something of this size and complexity should follow the [normal proposal process](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home).

Well, as far as i know, the proposal is for creating new addongs/Core modul. But this shouldn't be an addon or so on. It should be integreated into the Zend\_Db class. Or do you think, its better to create a new class for this also, like: Zend\_Db\_Cache? In my opinion, its not nessesary to create a new Proporsal, but if needed ( for managment issues/structure ), i can register as a Programmer and take care of this proporsal.

So, how this is gonna handelt?

Please follow the normal proposal process for this new feature. Thanks.

The next steps would be to [submit a CLA](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement), and then make a post to fw-general to discuss this with the community.

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

We will not implement a client-side cache as part of the Zend\_Db component.

Most RDBMS products implement a server-side result set cache already.
