### Description

When I receive data in Firebug, I have some spaces or endline. See images. We could have a cleaning in Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug, method queryEnd:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $profile = $this->getQueryProfile($queryId);
    
    $cleanQuery = preg_replace('/\\s+/', ' ', $profile->getQuery());
    
    $this->_totalElapsedTime += $profile->getElapsedSecs();
    
    $this->_message->addRow(array(round($profile->getElapsedSecs(),5),
                                          $cleanQuery,
                                          ($params=$profile->getQueryParams())?$params:null));


instead of

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $profile = $this->getQueryProfile($queryId);
            
    $this->_totalElapsedTime += $profile->getElapsedSecs();
            
    $this->_message->addRow(array(round($profile->getElapsedSecs(),5),
                                          $profile->getQuery(),
                                          ($params=$profile->getQueryParams())?$params:null));

Good idea. I'll add that.

Beware that spaces can be part of query, e.g.

````

It would be bad to remove those spaces in such cases as it "modifies" the query.

That's a good point. Part of the purpose of the Firebug integration is to show exactly what is passed to the DB, so changing the query at all may be misleading. It may be better to offer two views in Firebug. A "raw" and a "beautified" view that will also do syntax highlighting.

Does anyone know of an open-source javascript library to parse an SQL query and present it formatted?
