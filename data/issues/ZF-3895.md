ZF-3895: Db Select Limit should throw exception on $count=0

### Description

The limit function of Zend\_Db\_Select works the other way round than the Mysqls Limit statement (for example $select->limit(30, 0) translates to LIMIT 0,30). For convenience users it should be considered to throw an Exception on usage of $select->limit(0, 30) to show miss-usage.

Currently using limit(0,30) leads to the limit statement to be left out completly in assembling which can easily be overseen.

would this generate valid SQL synatx against any other DBMS (is it only breaking mysql)?
