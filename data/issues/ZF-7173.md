### Description

This constant should be listed along with the others in both these pages, otherwise one has to dig into the code to figure out how to translate or set a message for the basic format validation.

The reason this new constant hasn't been documented yet is because it's not in the 1.8 branch, and will be available when 1.9 is released (I think).
