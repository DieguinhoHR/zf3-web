### Description

I've had my own URL helper in 0.2. After upgrading to 0.6, which has a URL helper built-in, the built-in helper is always loaded first.

{panel:title=From the documentation} In fact, you can "stack" paths using the addHelperPath() method. As you add paths to the stack, Zend\_View will look at the most-recently-added path for the requested helper class. This allows you to add to (or even override) the initial distribution of helpers with your own custom helpers. {panel}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->addHelperPath('/path/to/helpers', 'Zend_View_Helper');


In Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_addPath(), new paths are added to the beginning of the array but in Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() they are reversed before iteration. This way it is actually FIFO.

If I remove array\_reverse() in foreach, everything is OK.
