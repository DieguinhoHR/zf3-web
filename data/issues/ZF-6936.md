### Description

Our machine has the pcre binary compiled without Unicode support (thanks, Red Hat), and when running unit tests some Zend\_Filter\_Word ones fail. The failures are the same as those detailed in #ZF-2484. I traced the problems to the fallback regular expression in SeparatorToCamelCase.php. A patch is below.

Just to note: Attaching lowercased "a-z" to the preg-pattern has no effect on unicode.

But it seems as this would break the separator as it would allow "smallcase" when "Smallcase" should be used.

Notice the match pattern a few lines up that includes \\p{L}{1}. That is the match pattern that is used when Unicode is enabled. When it is disabled, it falls back to the pattern I changed (thus why this problem doesn't manifest for most people who run the tests). Allowing lowercase letters in the match pattern means that we can match a string like Camel-cased-words and convert it to CamelCasedWords. This is the intent of the code, and is what the Unicode-enabled version does with \\p{L}{1}, which matches a Unicode 'letter'.

Already fixed in past with r16188
