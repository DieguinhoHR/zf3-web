### Description

Class doc-block needs to be changed. Currently states as description "Encrypts a given string." but the class does nothing of the sort. Similar to ZF-7451 just filed.

Well, the issue occurs in two different classes so I thought it better to log separate issue for each class. One is for NormalizedToLocalized.php and the other is for LocalizedToNormalized.php.
