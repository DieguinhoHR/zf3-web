ZF-7457: Dojo ComboBox default value does not appear when no options are added
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-08-03T11:03:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:40.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The value of a ComboBox is lost if it does not have any options added. A ComboBox is rendered as a select form element, and the decorator removes the value attribute. This is fine when there are options and an option matches the value. But in a ComboBox with no options the value should be preserved in the input tag. This is important to keep because the ComboBox's options may be filled later with a datastore.

The following should make a ComboBox with "test" as its value.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Dojo_Form();
    $combo = $form->createElement('ComboBox', 'combo');
    $combo->setValue('Test');
    $form->addElement($combo);
