### Description

Hello

Not sure if this is a bug or pre-determined behavior however, in a view when calling;

echo $this->baseUrl();

without passing any params you would expect it to return the sites base url such as <www.mysite.com>.

However if on another page of the site, calling the above line returns the current page you are on. If however you then pass;

$this->baseUrl('');

You get the correct site base url address.

Just wondering if this is a bug or is implemented like this for a reason?

Thanks

Closing as a non-issue.

This is the expected behaviour for the baseurl view helper. for the server url, there is the serverUrl view helper.

Please direct support requests to either #zftalk on irc (freenode) or to the zf-general mailing list.
