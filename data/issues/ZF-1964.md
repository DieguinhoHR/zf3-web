This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Unassigning Zend\_Pdf issues currently assigned to me pending decision on ZF 2.0 release timeframe and potential contribution of comprehensive changeset.

Hi, i made this method to be added to Zend\_Pdf to check if a file is a valid PDF:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
        /**
         * Reads a file in binay and checks (translated for better legible to hexadecimal) the first 4 values
         * If the file is a valid PDF, in hex should be "25 50 44 46" (in ASCII should be  "%PDF")
         *
         * @param string $file
         * @return boolean
         */
    
        public function isValid($file)
        {
    
            require_once 'Zend/Pdf/Exception.php';
    
            $handle = fopen($file, 'r');
    
            if ($handle) {
    
                foreach (unpack('C*', fgets($handle, 5)) as $dec)
                {
                    $tmp = dechex($dec);
                    $this->hex[] .= strtoupper(str_repeat('0', 2 - strlen($tmp)) . $tmp);
                }
    
    
            } else {
                throw new Zend_Pdf_Exception("Can not open '$file' file for read.");
            }
    
    
            if(implode($this->hex) == '25504446'){
    
                return true;
    
            } else {
    
                return false;
            }
    
        }

i saw this method is not needed because zf always check this on construct method (so forget about my method):

on Library/Zend/Parser.php (lines 393-397)

$pdfVersionComment = $this->\_stringParser->readComment(); if (substr($pdfVersionComment, 0, 5) != '%PDF-') { require\_once 'Zend/Pdf/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Pdf\_Exception('File is not a PDF.'); }
