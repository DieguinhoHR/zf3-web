### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $currency = new Zend_Currency("zh_TW");
    echo $currency->toCurrency(1000, "Latn", "zh_CN")."\n";


It will still display by zh\_TW format rather than zh\_CN.

Maybe you can go into details and describe where your problem is related to ???

You created a currency from locale "zh\_TW" with it's number formating rules and it's currency names & signs. Then you changed the output to be Latin script and number formating from zh\_CN.

Both locales define the same number formating rules.

Sorry, but I don't see your problem... Maybe you can describe what you expect to be the output.

I thought it will change the currency symbol either ?

Not this way... Once you created an currency you can not change the currency representation just with an locale.

You need to create a new currency with the expected locale or you can override the currency representation per hand with the setFormat parameters.

But toCurrency can not change the representation of the currency, only how the numbers are formatted.

Closing issue...

Problems related due to incorrect parameter handling.
