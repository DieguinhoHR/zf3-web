ZF-2700: Zend\_Validate\_Float might error with localeconv
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-21T08:03:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T16:25:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

in Zend\_Validate\_Float de lines (64-65):

$valueFiltered = str\_replace($locale['decimal\_point'], '.', $valueString); $valueFiltered = str\_replace($locale['thousands\_sep'], '', $valueFiltered);

should be replaced by :

$valueFiltered = str\_replace( array( $locale['decimal\_point'], $locale['thousands\_sep']), array( '.', '' ), $valueString );

Otherwise for example the dutch locale : 1.000.000,00 would transform to 100000000 instead of 1000000.00

Not quite right... the solution is simpler.

I don't know why this code was duplicated because it exists already in Zend\_Locale. But to get the right normalised value you have first to delete the thousand seperators and at last change the decimal point.

Or you could simply use Zend\_Locale\_Math::normalize();

I changed the two lines and it should now work with the existing solution and without any new feature.

Fixed with SVN-8714
