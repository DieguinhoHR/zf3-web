### Description

Hi,

I have assigned to this ticket major priority, because in ZF Dijit form elements doesn't exist any element, with the same functionality as is classic tag with .

There is dijit.ComboBox and dijit.FilteringSelect, but to this element can user enter and write text and doesn't exist any possibility to disable this behavior.

So for the users, which are using Dijit forms is necessary to have something like classic select tag and only one choice is .

dojox.form.DropDownSelect form element will be in 1.4 deprecated, because it will be removed to the dijit.form.DropDownSelect namespace.

I'm very lacking this form element in Dojo's forms.
