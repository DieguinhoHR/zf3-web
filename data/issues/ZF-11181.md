### Description

Mail Protocol Imap append() supports a date parameter which sets the date on the message that is appended.  
 This is not currently carried through to the Storage Imap class, so messageAppend() appends the message as though it arrived at the time it was appended instead of the time sent.

A quick fix is to simply allow appendMessage() to accept an optional date that it then passes along to append().

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    public function appendMessage($message, $folder = null, $flags = null, $date = null)
        {
            if ($folder === null) {
                $folder = $this->_currentFolder;
            }
    
            if ($flags === null) {
                $flags = array(Zend_Mail_Storage::FLAG_SEEN);
            }
    
            // TODO: handle class instances for $message
            if (!$this->_protocol->append($folder, $message, $flags, $date)) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Mail/Storage/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Mail_Storage_Exception('cannot create message, please check if the folder exists and your flags');
            }
        }


An alternate solution would be to take the date directly from the message, but that seems less helpful.
