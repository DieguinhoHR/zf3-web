### Description

This option 'ignoreConstants' is working in Zend\_Config\_Yaml and Zend\_Config\_Json, but Zend\_Config\_Ini. So here is a small patch for Zend\_Config\_Ini:

Hi Jace,

Thanks for the patch to contribute to ZF, but I notice that you don't appear to have a CLA on file, if you do, you should get in touch with Ralph Schindler and ask him to assign you the correct groups so that you can attach patches as an attachment rather than inline, otherwise, you should sign the cla ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)) and return it before contributing code, otherwise your contributions may go unused!

Jace -- As Kim indicated, we don't have a CLA on file, so we cannot apply this patch. Additionally, there may be a good reason for not having the "ignoreConstants" flag in the INI config. It was introduced for JSON and YAML as we actually needed to do some special parsing in order to detect and replace constant values, and the flag would eliminate the need for that parsing in the interest of performance. INI, however, does the constant interpolation natively. In fact, the options you suggest in the patch are specific to PHP versions >= 5.3.0, and passing the additional argument may cause breakage in versions prior to that. If we were to incorporate this functionality in ZF1, we should probably do a check for the PHP version first -- and determine whether we might want to try and natively support such functionality in PHP 5.2.X.

Aslo, be aware that INI\_SCANNER\_RAW is also buggy. See <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-0-3-released>.
