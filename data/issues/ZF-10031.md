### Description

The constructor attempts to login to the IMAP connection, and if it fails, then tries to throw an exception. That works fine.

What fails is that when the PHP process ends, the destructor for the IMAP protocol object is called, which calls its own logout() method. Since you're not actually logged in, this leads to a thrown exception, which PHP doesn't like (exceptions in destructors are bad). This is the source of the segfault you're seeing.

Reproduced only in PHP 5.3.2. Code in PHP 5.2 works fine.
