### Description

Zend Search Lucene doesn't seem to search in keyword fields with the find method ?

To reproduce :

$index = Zend\_Search\_Lucene::create('testing'); $lucene\_doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document(); $lucene\_doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Keyword('\_id', 'doc1')); $index->addDocument($lucene\_doc); $index->commit();

$hits = $index->find('doc1');

echo count($hits)." result(s)\\n"; // echoes "0 result(s)"

I have a slightly different problem. When I index with keyword, I can do a search but it's case sensitive. The others (text, unStored) works fine (case insensitive).

I'm sorry, ignore my message above. I was using 1.9.3PL where it happened, it seems to be working fine when I upgraded to 1.9.5.

My bad! It is still happening. Was looking at the wrong file just now. Terribly sorry for the unnecessary post above.

This issue is very old. It would be difficult, at this late stage in ZFv1's lifecycle, to fix this adequately without introducing a backwards-compatibilty break.
