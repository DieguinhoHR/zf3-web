### Description

Regarding this email: [http://nabble.com/Help-with-Zend\_Xmlrpc\_Value-tf37â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Help-with-Zend_Xmlrpc_Value-tf3776546s16154.html#a10678821)

The current date format used inside your class files is: 2007-05-18T22:31:31+02:00

However, the XML-RPC implementation of the ISO8601 requires this: 20070518T22:31:31

Omitt all dashes and TZ. I know this is misleading, since PHP's date('c', $foo) prints "another" ISO8601 date.

But if you look at the <a href="">www.xmlrpc.com/spec</a>" rel="nofollow">spec, you see the above examples - let alone all implementations of XML-RPC (in PHP, Python, Java, etc.) which I have checked over the last two days all format the date according to the spec and not as returned by date('c', $foo).

Connected. Because it doesn't work. The type is always a string, but needs to be of dateTime.iso8601.
