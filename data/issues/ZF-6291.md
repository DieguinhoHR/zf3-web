ZF-6291: Zend\_Cache::factory() denies creation of Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels backend on Linux

### Description

Due to its name sanitation in Zend\_Cache::\_normalizeName() Zend\_Cache::factory() does not allow the creation of a Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels backend on Linux systems (case-sensitive filenames) as Zend\_Cache::\_normalizeName() normalizes the string "TwoLevels" into "Twolevels" resulting in an include of "Zend/Cache/Backend/Twolevels.php" which fails on case-sensitive operating systems.

The currect hack is to set $customBackendNaming to true and use "Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels" as the $backendName.

The fix should be no problem because the strtolower()-call in line 219 of Zend/Cache.php is not really necessary - although I suspect that this change will break backwards-compatibility.

as said in the online manual for ZendPlatform or ZendServer backend, you have to add a separator in the backend name (for example "Two Levels" instead of "TwoLevels")

so I change the issue into a documentation improvement (it's not explicitly said for this this particular backend)

Thanks Fabien.

Even if this is mentioned in the documentation, I'll consider this a "dirty" hack just to circumvent the real problem with the strtolower(). I actually can not think of a use-case where this strtolower() will be of any benefit at all besides compensating for sloppy coding. If I didn't break BC, I wouldn't see any problem removing this function-call.

I use "Two\_Levels" as backend name for Zend\_Cache::factory(). All works fine.

Is this only document issue now? if so, I can add an example how to use into the document. :-) But if needs modify code, sadly ,I could not. :-(

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'Two Levels');

Currently I'd say we could live with an explicit remark in the manual.

Generally I think this is rather a code-issue. I'd be nice if you could at least change the manual to include an appropriate remark.

Hi, Stefan, thank You for comment.

I added the example to document at SVN r 17717, so I change the issue type from the Docs: Improvement to bug.

Hi, Stefan.

I tried step by step debugging over Zend\_Cache\_Backend class.

If we would use words that contains space mark or another mark like as ""Two Levels", I find we could get TwoLevels.php.

So, I close it as solved in next mini release, Docs:problem.
