### Description

I would like to suggest to create and supply within Zend\_Validate an UTF-8 validator. This validator should asserts the data passed is valid UTF-8 string.

Invalid user-supplied UTF-8 strings could results to a major security issues. Please, take a look into [http://code.google.com/docreader/…](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=doctype&s=doctype&t=ArticleMalformedUtf8) for additional information.

Thank you.

The provided usecase should be fixed by this proposal: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Filter_Html+-+Thomas+Weidner)

Closing as "needs proposal"
