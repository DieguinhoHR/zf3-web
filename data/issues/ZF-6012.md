### Description

The fix for this bug has created another one.

See <http://pastie.org/414375>

The Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client contructor should override the value of the Zend\_Http\_Client URI instead of current behavior, which ignores the value passed in constructor if an http client is passed to the constructor with a URI set.

This specific behavior is expected. If you need a different endpoint, instantiate a new XML/RPC client object.
