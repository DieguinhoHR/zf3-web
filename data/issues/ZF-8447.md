### Description

Every validate class doesn't load Zend\_Config class before use this to translate to array.

this is an example from Zend\_Validate\_Date

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($options instanceof Zend_Config) {
        $options = $options->toArray();
    }


this is a solution for that, i have ready used this in Zend\_Valida\_Isbn (in incubator)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (is_object($options)) {
        /**
         * @see Zend_Config
         */
        require_once 'Zend/Config.php';
        if ($options instanceof Zend_Config) {
            $options = $options->toArray();
        }
    }

A class does not need to be loaded in order for instanceof (or typehinting, for that matter) to work. It's absolutely unnecessary to call require\_once on classes referenced via instanceof.
