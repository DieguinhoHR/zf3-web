### Description

Try to parse (using Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap::\_decodeLine() ) the following line "\* STATUS blurdybloop (MESSAGES 231 UNSEEN 0)", in the result you'll miss last "0" token. It's because of incorrect parsing of tokens in the following code fragment (file Zend/Mail/Protocol/Imap.php)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    // only add if token had more than just closing braces
                    if ($token) {
                        $tokens[] = $token;
                    }


In input line above last token is "0" but expression "if ($token) {" treat it as numeric 0 and hence as a FALSE value. So instead of adding string "0" code ignores it.

Sergei, I think following code, do you think? If "(some strings 0 )" would be passed, it seems to work fine.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (rtrim($token) != '') {
        $tokens[] = rtrim($token);
    }

Yes, it looks fine for me.
