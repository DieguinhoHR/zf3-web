### Description

Zend\_Application phpSettings setting "phpSettings.date.timezone" should be mentioned here:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.html#zend.date.setdefaulttimezone)

For example I can define timezone in my application.ini my declaring this setting as follows:

phpSettings.date.timezone = "Europe/Helsinki"

Change affected component to Zend\_Application. Timezone IS mentioned by Zend\_Date.

Which other component you are using side by side with Zend\_Date does not change the setting itself. These components are completly independent from each other.

PHP configuration settings should be mentioned within Zend\_Application because there are also other configuration settings beside timezone which should be done when using Zend\_Application.
