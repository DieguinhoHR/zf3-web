### Description

There is a simple query with one join:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from('foo', '*'); 
    $select->join('bar', 'foo.id = bar.id', '*'); 


It should produce sql query like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT foo.*, bar.* 
    FROM foo 
    JOIN bar ON foo.id = bar.id 


But it produces this sql query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT foo_1.*, bar_1.* 
    FROM foo foo_1
    JOIN bar bar_1 ON foo.id = bar.id 


It doesn't work, PDO throwns exception: "SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1109 Unknown table 'foo' in on clause"

This bug affects some other methods eg. Zend\_Db\_Select::where() and it is connected with correlations feature added on last commit.

One more bug with generation of query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $this->db
        ->select()
        ->from(array('nstree' => 't1'), array('left_key', 'right_key', 'id'))
        ->joinLeft(array('nstree' => 'j1'), 
            '(j1.right_key >= t1.right_key AND j1.left_key <= t1.left_key)', 
            "GROUP_CONCAT(d.uri_part ORDER BY j1.level ASC SEPARATOR '/') AS path")
        ->joinLeft(array('pages' => 'd'), '(j1.page_id = d.id)', 'uri_part');


should produce

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT
        t1.*,
        GROUP_CONCAT(d.uri_part ORDER BY j1.level ASC SEPARATOR '/') AS path,
        d.uri_part
    FROM nstree t1
    LEFT JOIN nstree j1 ON (j1.right_key >= t1.right_key AND j1.left_key <= t1.left_key)
    LEFT JOIN pages d ON (j1.page_id = d.id)


but produces

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT
        t1.*,
        j1.GROUP_CONCAT(d.uri_part ORDER BY j1.level ASC SEPARATOR '/') AS path,
        d.uri_part
    FROM nstree t1
    LEFT JOIN nstree j1 ON (j1.right_key >= t1.right_key AND j1.left_key <= t1.left_key)
    LEFT JOIN pages d ON (j1.page_id = d.id)


problem is in "j1." before "GROUP\_CONCAT"

Maybe this could help. I'm using this workaround to avoid adding correlation name to "custom" fields.

 
    <pre class="highlight">

I don't think it would be good to do that kind of pattern-matching on the column name. Column names that are quoted can contain parentheses as part of the identifier.

There are also other cases that should not be prepended with the correlation name that do not contain parens.

I am proposing a different solution for this issue. See ZF-900.

You can specify the correlation name. Correlation names can be identical to the physical table name. For example:

Sorry, I hit send too soon.

The issue at the top of this issue report is that the class generates correlation names, and these do not match the correlation names in your join condition.

You can specify the correlation name. Correlation names can be identical to the physical table name. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( array('foo' => 'foo'), '*'); 
    $select->join( array('bar' => 'bar'), 'foo.id = bar.id', '*');


The secondary issues reported above are different; they are related to adding expressions to the select-list that should not have correlation names prepended. Another workaround for this is the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $this->db
        ->select()
        ->from(array('nstree' => 't1'), array('left_key', 'right_key', 'id'))
        ->from( '', "GROUP_CONCAT(d.uri_part ORDER BY j1.level ASC SEPARATOR '/') AS path")
        ->joinLeft(array('nstree' => 'j1'), 
            '(j1.right_key >= t1.right_key AND j1.left_key <= t1.left_key)', array() )
        ->joinLeft(array('pages' => 'd'), '(j1.page_id = d.id)', 'uri_part');


Above you see that if you pass '' as the table name, it does not generate a correlation name but it does add the named column to the select-list. Also, you can specify an empty array() for the column list in the joinLeft() method, which will add no columns from j1to the select-list. Otherwise it defaults to '\*'.

I'm resolving this issue as "Not an Issue". I intend to enhance Zend\_Db\_Select more, but it will be recorded under different issues in JIRA.
