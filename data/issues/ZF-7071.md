ZF-7071: Zend\_Gdata\_Youtube online tests hard-code developer API key
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Unit Tests: Problem Created: 2009-06-21T14:43:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:58.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend\_Gdata\_YouTubeOnlineTests test suite occasionally hard codes the API client ID and developer key. This duplicates configuration directives in TestConfiguration.php.dist. Either the hardcoded keys should be removed, or the configuration directives should be removed.

If the configuration directives are removed, then the hard coded ID and key should be moved to a constant. (Right now, these strings are duplicated in multiple positions within the code.)
