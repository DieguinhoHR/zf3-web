ZF2-575: Can not check if table is read only in Sql\\Select
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-09-19T13:09:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T18:36:35.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If a table name is passed to Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Select object when creating it, the tableReadOnly property is set to true.

If one wants to check later on in the code if that property is set to true, it can't be done, as tableReadOnly is protected and Sql\\Select has no isTableReadOnly() or getTableReadOnly() methods.
