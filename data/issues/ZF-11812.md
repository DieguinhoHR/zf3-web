### Description

Hey ZF Team,

Think I have found a bug in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect.

Example of this would be passing an array say a list of 0 to 5 as the value on the select element.

$multiItems = array( 'def' => 'Please select..', '0' => '0', '1' => '1', '2' => '2', '3' => '3', '4' => '4', '5' => '5' );

If I then created an element like this:

 
        $this->addElement('select', 'selectElement', array(
            'label' => 'Number list',
            'multiOptions' => $multiItems,
            'disable' => array('-'),
        ));


Then the first item (with the value of hyphen '-') will be disabled but so will the item with the value of 0.

After a little investigation this seems to be with the Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect in the \_build method on line 172 of my version of the view helper you have:

if (in\_array($value, $disable)) { $opt .= ' disabled="disabled"'; }

If I change this to:

 
        if (in_array($value, $disable, true)) {
            $opt .= ' disabled="disabled"';
        }


So that the strict option is enabled then it fixes the problem.

Not sure if this is a bug or a feature that I haven't seen docs for.

Confirmed. This happens due to "oddities" in how in\_array handles zero values ([Details here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2476878/a-problem-about-in-array)). By default, in\_array uses a loose comparison (==), so if the array contains an integer zero value it will cause in\_array to convert the needle to integer before comparing. Converting a character to an integer makes it zero, so any string will match that zero:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    php> var_dump(0 == 'adam');
    bool(true)


Additional to what you have suggested, it's also necessary to use strval to convert both the needle and haystack values to string representations to get consistent matching. I've attached a fix, complete with unit test, to this issue. Could you please try it out and see if it meets your needs?

After 1.12 as not sure what the implications of this change are.
