ZF-8850: Make BBCode parser optionnaly use ext/bbcode from PHP

### Description

<http://www.php.net/bbcode> for more information

C code is always (very)better than PHP code. Other classes such as Zend\_Json use the C extension of PHP if detected. I think Zend\_Markup\_Parser\_Bbcode should do the same with ext/bbcode (which can be activated by a simple "pecl install bbcode"). ext/bbcode is marked as stable, more commits informations on its PECL page <http://pecl.php.net/package/bbcode>

For that purpose, perhaps Zend\_Markup\_Parser\_Bbcode should be refactored to use internal adapters throught a common interface

I disagree here. The extension does not fit in any way into Zend\_Markup (I think). Besides that, if people want to use this extension, they should do it without Zend\_Markup. Again: IMHO.

The bbcode extension is a complete tokenizer/parser/rendere solution, which is not suitable for Zend\_Markup, as the bbcode extension cannot be used to generate a token list. Also, your example with Zend\_Json is pretty bad. Zend\_Json was created, when there was no native JSON extension in PHP, and it currently only exists for backward compatibility. With Zend Framework 2.0, it will most likely be removed.

Okay, got it ;-)

Actually, Ben, your notes on Zend\_Json are not entirely true. There are a few features in Zend\_Json\_Encoder that simply are not present in ext/json, including full unicode support as well as the ability to encode JavaScript lambdas. Additionally, both the encoder and decoder offer flags for treating objects/assoc arrays differently -- again, something ext/json does not offer. As such, we likely won't be deprecating it in 2.0.
