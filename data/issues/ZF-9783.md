ZF-9783: Zend\_Date::\_getLocalizedToken incorrectly translates time format into date format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-05-01T09:02:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-01T10:30:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.5 (26/May/10)

### Description

In Zend/Date.php (version 1.10.4) lines 4910 to 4916, the formats for TIME\_LONG, TIME\_MEDIUM and TIME\_SHORT are incorrectly translated into a date format. The strings 'date' should be replaced by 'time'.

This bug is visible when trying to test a time input with Zend\_Date::isValid(), for example: Zend\_Date::isDate('16:00', Zend\_Date::TIME\_SHORT) returns false, should return true.

Fixed with r22071

Note that your patch does not work. Next time it would be great if you test that your change really works before proposing it.
