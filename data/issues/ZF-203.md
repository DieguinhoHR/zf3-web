### Description

My Windows dev box doesn't have sqlite enabled in php.ini.

When running the unit tests, they stop at line 35 of tests\\Zend\\Cache\\SqliteBackendTest : $this->\_instance = new Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite(array( 'cacheDBCompletePath' => $this->\_cacheDir . 'cache.db' ));

There is no error message given, the phpunit script just dies:

$ phpunit.bat AllTests.php  
 PHPUnit 2.3.6 by Sebastian Bergmann.

......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ......................................... ............................. ralle@robnb /c/wwwroot/php\_include/zf\_trunk/tests $

Personally, I would prefer that this test honoured TestConfiguration.php.dist's define 'TESTS\_ZEND\_DB\_ADAPTER\_PDO\_SQLITE\_ENABLED' or something similar.

The "no error message" should be fixed in SVN.

The configuration option is ready but I can't commit on the file TestConfiguration.php.dist. (see ZF-211)

Moved to 0.1.5 as it appears a fix was committed
