### Description

Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_FirebugTest fails to tearDown() correctly when you don't have the pecl PDO\_SQLITE extension installed.

"Fatal error: Call to a member function getConnection() on a non-object in .../release-1.9.2/tests/Zend/Db/Profiler/FirebugTest.php on line 104"

A fix would be to check to see if the PDO\_SQLITE extension is loaded at the top of the tearDown() function
