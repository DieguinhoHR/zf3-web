### Description

As per ValidatorChain every Validator is called with second param $context. But the interface doesn't expose this one. This limits custom validators to make use of this feature.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Declaration of Framework\Validator\Match::isValid() must be compatible with that of Zend\Validator\ValidatorInterface::isValid()
