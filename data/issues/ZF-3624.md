ZF-3624: float(10,8) is handled in wrong way

### Description

i'm using pdo\_mysql, instance a zend\_db\_table to get table metadata (with zend\_db\_table::info() method), the bug is that, if on the db, a column is a float(n,n), the info() method returns DATA\_TYPE = 'float(n,n)' instead of "float"

this was already solved for the "decimal" data type time ago

 

 

### Comments

the fix should be done in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql::describeTable() using something like the same code used for the "decimal" detection (line 160 for ZF 1.5.2)

if (preg\_match('/^decimal((\\d+),(\\d+))/', $row[$type], $matches)) { $row[$type] = 'decimal'; $precision = $matches[1]; $scale = $matches[2]; }

maybe replacing "decimal" with "float" would fix
