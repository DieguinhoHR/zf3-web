### Description

Hello,

I've an index with ~12400 documents created with Zend\_Search\_Lucene version 1.8.1. The documents have a header with some special fields and most of their text in their field "body". The index has no public access. Searching the index resulted in strange hits.

First of all I made an update to version 1.10.0, but the problem lasts:

+body:"pro hemiole" +body:frist --> 106 hits +body:pro +body:hemiole +body:frist --> 1 hit

Allowing the words "pro" and "hemiole" to occur in any order instead of one after the other should increase the number of hits or at least find the same number of documents, but it REDUCES the number of hits.

After that I optimized the index, but it got worse:

+body:"pro hemiole" +body:frist --> 106 hits +body:pro +body:hemiole +body:frist --> 0 hit

Optimizing the index influences the result in the wrong direction.

Do you have any suggestions? Need some additional questions answered?

Greetings Lutz
