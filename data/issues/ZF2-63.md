### Description

Can you add Zend\\Code as component?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ phpunit Zend/Code
    PHPUnit 3.5.10 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    
    ......F
    PHP Fatal error:  Class 'Zend\Code\Scanner\DerivedScanner\AggregateDirectoryScanner' not found in zf2/tests/Zend/Code/Scanner/DerivedScanner/DerivedClassScannerTest.php on line 16


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Declaration of Zend\Code\Scanner\AggregateDirectoryScanner::getClasses() should be compatible with that of Zend\Code\Scanner\DirectoryScanner::getClasses()
    
    zf2/library/Zend/Code/Scanner/AggregateDirectoryScanner.php:112
