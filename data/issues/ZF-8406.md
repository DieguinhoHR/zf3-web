### Description

Hallo,

I searched the code of Zend\_Form, why the following example code doesn't work.

Well I saw that an element of zend form is only created with an associative name. If you want create elements with the same name but a different index and these elements should be shown in html without an index in the name you can do it right now. Well I modified the Zend\_Form class but it is untested and I don't know what classes I also have to modify that it works fine but I think it is an approch for it.

example code:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    $inputs = array();
    
    for($i=0; $i < 3; $i++) {
    
    for($n=0; $n < 2; $n++) {
    
    $inputs[] = new Zend_Form_Element_TextBox("test" . $i,
                                        array("value" => "test123",
                                         "trim" => true,
                                         "isArray" => true));
    
    }
    }
    
    $this->addElements($inputs);
    
    $this->addElement("SubmitButton",
                "button",
                array("label" => "save"));
    


Normally 6 elements should displayed in html but only 3 are given. The "isArray" option even appends squared brackes but you really can't use them.

I also attached some files which modifications I did.

I hope this new functionality will be implemented next time.

This is not possible at the moment because you will add 3 times an Element with an equal name to the form which is not supported, because the Elements are held within an array in Zend\_Form with the name as associative key. So $form->order['test1'] overwrites the previous test1, and so on.
