ZF-326: SMTP transport is not prepending dots to lines beginning with a dot

### Description

Zend/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php does not insert a leading dot for every line that begins with a dot. I've quoted the RFC below.

See Section 4.5.2 of RFC 2821 - Before sending a line of mail text, the SMTP client checks the first character of the line. If it is a period, one additional period is inserted at the beginning of the line.

- When a line of mail text is received by the SMTP server, it checks the line. If the line is composed of a single period, it is treated as the end of mail indicator. If the first character is a period and there are other characters on the line, the first character is deleted.

A patch to conform to the RFC.

I've updated the priority to Major, as this still has the potential to mangle emails (e.g. broken images) in rare situations.

Further to this, I discovered that Matthew Leverton's patch still wasn't catching a few examples of lines where the leading character was a '.'. I traced it back to the fact that Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract defines a line end as '/r/n' whereas Zend\_Mime was using '/n' as a line end.

Substituting $this->EOL with Zend\_Mime::LINEEND did the trick - here's the diff (and will attach separately):-

Fixes erroneous detection of line endings

Scheduling for 0.7.0 release.

This issue has regressed. Simon's comments on 20 Sep still apply -- the "foreach(explode($this->EOL, $data) as $line) { " (now in Mail/Protocol/Smtp.php) is using self::EOL instead of Zend\_Mime::LINEEND.

Reopening on behalf of [~aren].

I'm not quite sure why this was re-opened - the updated patch applies to Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp, but for a long time now the handling of pre-prending the dot is carried out by Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp, and the code in data() definitely handles the 'dot' correctly.

 

 

Posted by Aren Sandersen (aren) on 2007-07-15T20:14:26.000+0000

Zend\_Mime's encodeQuotedPrintable() uses LINEND ("\\n") as the line-break sequence, but Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp's data() method is looking for self::EOL ("\\r\\n") as line-breaks. Since these don't match, newlines inserted as a result of quoted-printable encoding aren't detected properly and this issue happens.

Please re-open.

Further investigation of the issue by Aren Sandersen pointed to a logic error in Smtp components

Resolution committed in SVN revision 5724 - please test and confirm the issue is fixed.

 

 

Posted by Aren Sandersen (aren) on 2007-07-17T15:26:25.000+0000

Confirmed; my tests show the issue is fixed.

This also fixed my missing dot issue, but seemed to introduce a new issue. When I use setBodyHtml() and setBodyText() together to create the email, the resulting sent email only shows the text version with:

'Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable'

displayed at the top of the received email text. The text version of the email is shown, not the html as would be expected. In addition, long email text is mangled and interspersed with various line break characters.

Fix version after 1.0.1.

 

 

Posted by Simon Mundy (peptolab) on 2007-11-05T19:50:44.000+0000

Todd, can you please verify this behaviour occurs in release 1.0.2? If so, can you please attach new files to this issue with your code, the original message you are trying to send and - if possible - a dump of the resulting Zend\_Mail object just before it is sent.

No further evidence of bug exists

The issue is still partially present in versions 1.11.6 and 1.11.0. It seems that only Windows environments are affected. The problem is in PHP mail function. It is mentioned in the official PHP documentation at <http://php.net/mail> (caution text for "message" parameter).

Is it possible to alter the current Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp implementation, so it would consider this bug and the developer using Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp would not need to worry about it?
