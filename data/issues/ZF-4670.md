### Description

The biggest bottleneck of plugin loading is due to cases when the file is not found on the given paths; when it is not, an error is pushed onto the PHP error stack -- a very expensive operation that often takes up to 10 times as long as the actual include() call.

A file path cache should be added to Zend\_Loader::loadFile() to allow caching the success or failure of loading so that in subsequent requests for the given path/file combination, the method may return early if the combination will not resolve.

Original implementation led to performance degradation under normal use cases.
