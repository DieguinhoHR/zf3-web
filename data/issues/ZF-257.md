I was also thinking this might be a good feature to have. Or something like <a href="">www.cherrypy.org/wiki/Filters22</a>" rel="nofollow">CherryPy's filters, which is similar to the current plugin system, but able to be done on a per-controller basis.

The MVC implementation in 0.2.0's incubator (and current SVN) introduced pre/postDispatch() methods that are executed for every action. The stubs in the Zend\_Controller\_Action class do nothing by default, but you may have them do anything you desire when extending the class. Performing a \_forward() action in the preDispatch() method will skip execution of the current action.
