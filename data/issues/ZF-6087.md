### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight"> DASPRiD, am I right when saying that I can't set helper paths by using config files only?
    ....
     but atm I cannot set the helperpaths through a ini config?
     lemme lookup it quickly
     Freeaqingme, resources.view.helperpath = "Zym_View_Helper"
     it just supports a single helper path there
     also
     but, that doesn't allow me to add more than one path?
     Freeaqingme, resources.view.helperpathprefix = "Zym_View_Helper"
     Freeaqingme, resources.view.helperpath = "Zym/View/Helper"
     or such
     I c
     but that is only for one helper, it doesn't support multiple I guess?
     according to the zend_view_abstract constructor, nope
     you may tacle matthew
     so that resource would need to get patched a bit?
     to make it support multiple paths
     not the resource
     but zend_view
     why not the resource?
     because its not part of the resource to do so
     it should just pass the options to zend_view
     and zend_view should then handle it
     it should only get in the resource, when it would be a bc break for zend_view
     but it wouldnt :)
     create a sub-task, i c if i can create a patch for it today

Support has been added to Zend\_VIew's constructor to allow this now as of r14965. You can now pass view helper paths and filter paths as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.helperPath.Zym_View_Helper = "Zym/View/Helper"
    resources.view.filterPath.Zym_View_Filter = "Zym/View/Filter"


and, of course, add additional prefix/path combinations.
