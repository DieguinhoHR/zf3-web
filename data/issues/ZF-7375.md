### Description

Hi,

there is a bug in 1.9.0 b1 in the file: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File.php at line 958. In the function \_fileGetContents($file): There is used a variable called $mqr, but this variable is not declared before. In version 1.9.0a1 the variable is declared before with

 
        if (function_exists('get_magic_quotes_runtime')) {
            $mqr = @get_magic_quotes_runtime();
            @set_magic_quotes_runtime(0);
        }


Maybe you can fix it

get\_magic\_quotes/set\_magic\_quotes have been deprecated for some time, and we removed the calls to it in b1. However, as you note, we missed one; this has been corrected now on the trunk and 1.9 release branch.
