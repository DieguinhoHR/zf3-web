ZF-10561: Ability to utilize a Cache for a Session SaveHandler: Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_Cache
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-10-15T10:59:35.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-10-19T09:17:49.000+0000 Status: Postponed Fix version(s):

### Description

Utilizing a Cache as a session saveHandler is like having a saveHandler as a database except a bit more flexible.

The cache supports the Zend\_Cache\_Core frontend and any backend attached to it. This becomes extremely valuable for things like Memcache / Memcached. In a development environment we have even used APC.

Attached is a patch for this improvement that contains the SaveHandler support and tests.

The files are as follows: M tests/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/AllTests.php A tests/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/CacheTest.php A library/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/Cache.php

Usage:

Configuration INI File (for Zend\_Application): resources.session.saveHandler.class = Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_Cache

Bootstrap.php (for Zend\_Application):

 
    <pre class="literal">
        protected function _initSessionCache()
            $this->bootstrap('session');
            $opts = $this->getOptions();
            if ('Zend_Session_SaveHandler_Cache' == $opts['resources']['session']['saveHandler']['class']) {
                $cache = $this->bootstrap('cachemanager')
                              ->getResource('cachemanager')
                              ->getCache('memcached');
                Zend_Session::getSaveHandler()->setCache($cache);
            }
        }

Hi Mike

There a need of elaborate a propose, but already exists a porpose to this component [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Session_SaveHandler_Cache+-+Nick+Daugherty).

I have a code similar the this but propose only would accepted until final of August.

Also Zend\_Session in ZF2 has changes and Zend\_Cache is in phase refactoring.

Greetings Ramon

For the record: the SaveHandler functionality in ZF2 is not much changed, if at all, as it simply provides an interface for building a component that works with session\_set\_save\_handler.

Mike -- I'd forgotten about the cache savehandler, and that it was already accepted. Closing this issue, as it will be implemented for ZF2.
