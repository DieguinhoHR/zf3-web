ZF-311: Zend\_Filter::isPhone returns TRUE instead of passed value on success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-08-07T22:39:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

As the summary says, the function acts diffrent from what the docblock says. {quote}

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    /**
     * Returns value if it is a valid phone number format, FALSE
     * otherwise. The optional second argument indicates the country.
     * This method requires that the value consist of only digits.
    ...


The code is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    I suggest it be changed to:


if (!in\_array($areaCode, $areaCodes)) { return FALSE; }

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    and add:


to the end of the function.

This bug also applies to most(or all) of the Zend\_Filter::is\* functions.

Changing fix version to 0.9.0.

I fixed all of these comments. This issue affected all is\* methods, as the original design was changed.
