I don't see how you should get this output.

In both, branch 1.6 and trunk (1.7) the extension is detected by

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    substr($file['name'], strrpos($file['name'], '.') + 1);


in the isValid method. As you see the extension is the last rightest dot to the end. (str r pos). Both files are 5 weeks old and should be in 1.6 as also 1.7 Pre.

Not in 1.6.1.... but as I said... this bug was solved 5 weeks ago before 1.6.2 has been released. Maybe you are using 1.6.1 and not 1.6.2 ?

Yes you are right, I'm using 1.6.1.

Didn't find a ticket for it though.

Nevermind.
