ZF-5732: Missing request values from Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

We have HTTP request object but it doesn't contains the get, post, cookie, etc values. These getPost(), getCookie(), getServer(), getEnv(), etc.. functios only returns from the superglobals. So if we want to save these parameters, we cannot just save the request object included with all the request parameters, we have to save the object and save the request separately.

I agree. I also suggest ([just right here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_Controller+2.0)) that some Zend\_Filter\_Input should be shared with Request object to make paka-yoke filtering available.

getQuery() and others could then return a filtered memorised params from $\_GET and friends.
