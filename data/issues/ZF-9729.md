### Description

Same as ZF-7743 (It's actually not fixed. Feel free to close this as a dup and reopen ZF-7743.)

"i think Zend\_Tool can be improved in the following ways 1. upon module generation i think resources.frontController.moduleDirectory = APPLICATION\_PATH "/modules" should be added to application.ini"

Maybe also something that will make models for work per module. As of now modules' models are not accessible. Or it is not obvious how to access them.
