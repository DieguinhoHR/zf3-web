When running a search and calling getDocument() on the result set.

The following error is raised: Invalid argument supplied for foreach(), on line 682

Actually the problem is in the resources cleaning up. Index is closed when index object goes out of scope. QueryHit object uses delayed document retrieving to speed up searching.

Index should not be closed until index object itself _and_ all query hit objects go out of scope.
