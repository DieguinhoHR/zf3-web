ZF-733: Zend\_Service\_Rest will not accept URI's with query args
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-09T18:16:15.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-19T12:54:50.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend REST client doesn't will not work if you use query args in your URL. This can be traced back to Zend\_Uri\_Http.

Example of a REST request that will fail:

<http://www.example.com/users/1?foo=bar>

Once you remove the query arg, all is well.

My mistake -- I didn't read the documentation carefully. Please close this issue.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
