ZF2-517: GenericHeader should be able to parse header with empty value

### Description

I'm iterating over the emails in an inbox like this:

$mails = new Zend\\Mail\\Storage\\Pop3($pop3); foreach ($mails as $key => $mail) { // ... }

One of the emails has an empty header field "X-Spam-Flag:". This causes the following exception to be thrown:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\\Mail\\Header\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException' with message 'Header must match with the format "name: value"' in Zend/Mail/Header/GenericHeader.php:43

I've just found another email that does not separate the header name and value with ": " but with ":" (no whitespace).

I think GenericHeader::fromString should be less strict and just use

$parts = explode(':', $decodedLine, 2);

instead of

$parts = explode(': ', $decodedLine, 2);
