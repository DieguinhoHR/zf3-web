### Description

Zend\_Loader::loadFile method suppress errors in included user files. For example user action controllers.

Need to remove/replace following lines (remove @ - error control operator): if ($once) { $return = @include\_once $filename; } else { $return = @include $filename; }

Maybe Zend\_Loader should get an error handler that is set with set\_error\_handler and restored with restore\_error\_handler around the include that throws a Zend\_Loader\_Exception with the appropriate message, much like Zend\_Soap\_Server does error handling around the $soap->handle() call.

I just tried to find this issue in the bughuntday branch, but was unable to find this code snippet in Zend/Loader.php. Also the error-suppression issues in ZF seem to be under discussion at the moment, so I'm stopping my work on this issue for now.

The @operator is only used in the isReadable method, and it has it's reasons. Marked as irrelevant.
