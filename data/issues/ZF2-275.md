### Description

Assign on Zend\\Search because Zend\\Service is not available.

I would like add an options container (Zend\\Service\\Twitter\\SearchOptions) for Zend\\Service\\Twitter\\Search to complete options which are no present (result\_type for exemple) and add flexibility. Based container on Zend\\Stdlib\\Options.

Pull request in github.
