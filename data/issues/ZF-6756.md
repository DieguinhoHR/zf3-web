ZF-6756: PluginLoader does not exclusively lock the plugin cache file it writes too
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Under load and when using APC I get strange behavior. I think there should be some file locking to prevent concurrent write attempts and reads as the app builds up the cache. This is similar to the bugs ZF-5585 and another one which I forget.
