### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/147>

\_prepareRest in Zend\_Service\_Rest is defined as

final private function \_prepareRest($path, $query)

whereas restPost, restPut and restDelete of that class all call

$this->\_prepareRest($path);

I think the $query argument should be $query=null
