### Description

I have at least one PDF where when loaded by Zend\_PDF, Zend\_Memory\_Container\_Locked objects are pulled into the Document Type Dictionary properties array.

Array ( ... [SaveStreams] => Array ( [Q] => Zend\_Memory\_Container\_Locked Object ( [value] => Q )

 
            [q] => Zend_Memory_Container_Locked Object
                (
                    [value] =>  q 
                )
    
        )
    
    [Changes] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [Creator] => SPDF
                    [Producer] => SPDF
                    [ModDate] => D:20060401000353-05'00'
                    [CreationDate] => D:20060401000353-05'00'
                )
    
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [Version] => 3.0, SPDF Build Number 1085 for Linux 7, Application Build Date: May 15 2003
                    [ModDate] => D:20060401050353-00'00'
                    [Product] => AppendPro
                    [Vendor] => Appligent
                )
    
        )


... )

If you then modify the properties array, saving crashes with a fatal error.

Code sufficient to reproduce the error

PDF through which this bug is reproducible. It does have an atypical properties structure.

metadata output from adobe acrobat - may not be useful.

Interestingly, Adobe Acrobat ignores the array(s). This also may not be useful.

A work-around for this issue is to wipe the metadata and start over from scratch.

This is still a problem in 1.10.3

error message: PHP Catchable fatal error: Object of class Zend\_Memory\_Container\_Locked could not be converted to string in /www/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Pdf/Element.php on line 155
