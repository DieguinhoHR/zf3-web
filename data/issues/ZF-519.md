ZF-519: [Incubator] [Coding Standard] setParam() vs addParam()

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract (and therefore Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http) use setParam() to define values. Zend\_Controller\_Front, Zend\_Controller\_Router, Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter, and Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher use addParam() instead.

Since they all do the same thing, it would be best to pick one name for all of them.

I was going to argue with this, but got to thinking, and I'm proposing the following:

- setParam(): use to add a new parameter or overwrite an existing parameter
- getParam(): use to retrieve a single parameter
- setParams(): use to set multiple parameters at once; will overwrite parameters if they already exist, but won't affect parameters not in the array passed to it
- clearParams(): reset the parameter stack

I will start implementing this in the incubator in the repository.

oh, and:

- getParams(): use to retrieve entire list of parameters

I agree that this is the best solution. This is how I normally name things. Thanks
