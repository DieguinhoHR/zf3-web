### Description

The Adapter has a feature to check for rerouting if possible ie.

messageId = 'Foobar' and i want to translate into en\_GB but its not available in en\_GB i can configure route en\_GB -> de\_DE this doesnt works anymore because there is a case where the adapter try to check if not found also for the language itself (en\_GB -> en) this causes an issue where the routing mechanism doenst work anymore. I will provide a fix for this issue
