ZF-3495: addDate gives wrong result
-----------------------------------

### Description

require\_once 'Zend/Date.php';

$date = new Zend\_Date('23 jun 2008 14:00:27'); $date->addDate("0001-00-00", "YYYY-MM-dd"); echo $date;

Gives "22 jun 2009 14:00:27" while it should be "23 jun 2009 14:00:27"

I don't know what you'd expect when you add "Jannuary - 1" months and "First - 1" days.... I'd expect unexpected results.

You are giving a DATE not just a number... and a date "1 BC 0 month 0 day" is in real date 0 years, 12 months and 31 days", so what you are getting as result looks ok for me dependend on your input.

Iregular input in example. Result is correct depending on the input, the manual and the api.
