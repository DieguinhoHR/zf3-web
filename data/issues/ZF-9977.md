### Description

I get internal server error when try to execute query via Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql

$db = new Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql($config); $stmt = $db->query($sql);

if my $sql string is relatively small it works fine. but if $sql strin length is for example 36194 characters i get this weird "Internal server error" code 500

I checked it using plain PDO syntax and it worked fine so this pure Zend problem. It looks like problem is in Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo.

Could be the same problem as reported in ZF-8399.

I have not seen the query, but I am 99% sure this is related to the preg\_replace that Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract's quote method does as mentioned inside ZF-8399 and others.

If you feel this is not a duplicate, and can be reproduced with a very minimal reproduction script which is different than the one already described, please reopen.
