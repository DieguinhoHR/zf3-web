### Description

Suppose I want to use Zend\_Tool with another PHP framework / to do other stuff. I am unable to change the loader in a clean way, and end up having to use zf along with all the providers for the ZF, although I don't wanna use any.

Or am I missing something?

Apparently I was missing something. ENV var ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS can be used to specify the loader =P

Thanks for the great tool (no pun intended)

Apparently this is a "not an issue". Can we close it?
