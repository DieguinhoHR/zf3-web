ZF-2788: Add option to disable loading default decorators in Zend\_Form
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-03-03T14:18:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T16:25:31.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

Currently, decorators for the various Zend\_Form object are _always_ loaded; default decorators exist and are loaded by default. In some cases, you may not want this: \* If using Zend\_Form in models for input filtering, and allowing re-purposing the model for use with a web service \* When using Zend\_Form::setElementDecorators() (no need to load decorators twice!) To accomplish this, a new flag should exist, 'loadDefaultDecorators'; when true (the default), the default decorators will be loaded; otherwise, they will not. Additionally, the protected \_loadDefaultDecorators() method should be made public, to allow loading them on-demand.

Added new configuration flag, disableLoadDefaultDecorators. For instance:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form(array('disableLoadDefaultDecorators' => true));
    
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element('foo', array('disableLoadDefaultDecorators' => true));
    
    $form->addDisplayGroup(array('foo', 'bar'), 'foobar', array('disableLoadDefaultDecorators' => true));


Available in trunk and 1.5 release branch.
