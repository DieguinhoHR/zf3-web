### Description

There's a bug in the Zend\_Service\_Rest restPost method, it doesn't set the 2nd argument for the Zend\_Service\_Rest \_prepareRest method. This is what the original code looks like:

 
    final public function restPost($path, $data)
    {
       $this->_prepareRest($path);
       $this->_uri->queryArray($data);
       return self::getHttpClient()->post($data);
    }


$this->\_prepareRest($path) should actually be $this->\_prepareRest($path,$data);

In the same piece of code the $this->\_uri->queryArray() call causes a fatal error, because Zend\_Uri\_Http doesn't have such a method. It must be called with setQueryArray() and the return value should be capture in $data. Here's the correct code:

 
    final public function restPost($path, $data)
    {
       $this->_prepareRest($path);
       $data = this->_uri->setQueryArray($data);
       return self::getHttpClient()->post($data);
    }


The same situation also applies for the restPut() method!!
