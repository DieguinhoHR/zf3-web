### Description

This really took me hours to figure out. I tried to verify myself with OpenId and it was working fine on server A but not on server B while the script is the same, including PHP version (5.2.6). I debugged my \*ss of to find out why the verify function was failing me and it all came down to 1 small function: symlink.

This is the piece of code in Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer\_Storage\_File in the function addAssociation:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    if (function_exists('symlink')) {
        symlink($name1, $name2);
    } else {
        $f2 = @fopen($name2, 'w+');
        if ($f2) {
            fwrite($f2, $data);
            fclose($f2);
        }
    }


The symlink function does exist but it returns false and thus the assoc\_handle\_{hash} file isnt written to the filesystem which causes the getAssociationByHandle function to fail during the verification process. After removing the symlink part (so it would always use the fopen/frwite/fclose functions) everything was working like a charm. So, maybe its a good thing to add an extra check if the symlink function really worked.

What operating system do you use?

Im running CentOS5 with PHP5.2.6

Maybe important to know: im running suPHP and I've patched PHP with the wellknown Suhosin patch.

Same problem occurs on Windows (PHP 5.3.8 (cli) (built: Aug 23 2011 11:50:20)), because you need superuser priviledges to create symlinks.

```

Removing the symlink part fixes it for me. It looks like the symlink is only improvement, not requirement. I suggest removing it. It's not fatal error, but it emits a warning

Patch that removes the symlink logic from storage class

I'll try to look at it and compare OSX vs. Win but I'm not sure it will be ready for 1.12. as I'm pretty busy now :(
