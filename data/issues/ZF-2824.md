### Description

In current implementation when creating lets say SELECT element, we need to pass the options as 'val'=>'text', with that approache we face a problem when we want to assign integer value to option. With current zend\_config we would need to have in XML something like <1>type11>, this is illegal in xml - so we cant assign integer values to options, and i think that is the most common use case for select elements ( database normalization for inserting values etc. ).

I would suggest we have something that could accept a format like

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    array(1) {
      ["multiOptions"]=>
      array(3) {
        [0]=>
        array(2) {
          ["val"]=>
          string(1) "1"
          ["key"]=>
          string(2) "aa"
        }
        [1]=>
        array(2) {
          ["key"]=>
          string(1) "2"
          ["val"]=>
          string(4) "xxxx"
        }
        [2]=>
        array(2) {
          ["val"]=>
          string(3) "444"
          ["key"]=>
          string(4) "ssss"
        }
      }
    }


That way we can store our configuration in XML and generate options with text values as well.

Resolved in trunk and release-1.5 branch. You can now specify formats like the following in your config files:

- INI
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    [testing]
    options.first.key = "aa"
    options.first.value = 1
    options.second.value = "xxxx"
    options.second.key = 2
    options.third.key = "ssss"
    options.third.value = 444


- XML
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    aa1xxxx2ssss444

- PHP:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    $options = array(
        array(
            'value' => '1',
            'key'   => 'aa',
        ),
        array (
            'key'   => '2',
            'value' => 'xxxx',
        ),
        array (
            'value' => '444',
            'key'   => 'ssss',
        ),
    );

I would suggest reopening this issue for the following reason: Short-hand xml configuration does not work.

 
    <pre class="highlight">1Male

Generates this (formatted for readability):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        
        Male
    
    
        
        Female
