I dont really understand your problem...

setWeekday uses WEEKDAY\_8601... the ISO format... ISO defines 1 as Montag and 7 as Sunday. All setxxx functions work with ISO format. getWeekday returns a DATE OBJECT and no string.

The ordinary toArray function returns the date as array where the weekday is treated as WEEKDAY\_DIGIT which is like PHP's 'w' token.

Btw: When you give an array as input the weekday is used as WEEKDAY\_DIGIT like with toArray.

Yes, that's the point. ISO weekday is not used as PHP's.

Sorry... I still don't see the problem.

Input format's always differ depending on the way you use... As already said: Array = GNU Format setXX = ISO Format getXX = Date Object

ISO defines 1 as monday and 7 as sunday GNU defines 0 as sunday and 6 as saturday

We can't say that 7 is ok for GNU format and we can also not say that 0 is ok for ISO. These rules are defined through the standards.
