### Description

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value and child classes set the XML encoding for the values when creating XML using DOM. This can cause encoding issues with the server and client, which allow setting explicit encoding, resulting in erroneous or missing XML.

Removing the encoding argument to the DOMDocument constructor fixes the issue.
