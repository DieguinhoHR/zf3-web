### Description

According to the release log of ZF1.9 the Dojo Release should be version 1.3.2. But it still seems to be 1.3.0. And why is it a dev-version? shouldn't it be a productive version for a stable ZF Release?

We tag to the 1.3 release branch, and report whatever the current version is available at the time.

The reason we tag to a release branch is to ensure we have the build tools available in the version we distribute, which is not possible if we use an official build.
