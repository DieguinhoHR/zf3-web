### Description

Currently the minHeight property of the Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor can only be set to em, whereas the height property can be set to em, px or %.

It would be nice to be able to set the minHeight with em, px or %.

A patch which enables setting the minHeight as em, px or %. Leaving em as default, even if the default for the height property is px, to make it BC.
