### Description

I got an issue during the validation on an array. For an element with : $\_allowEmpty = true; $\_isArray = true; $\_required = false;

Into Zend\_Form\_Element::isValid($value, $context = null) : If you submit an empty value, you'll have $value = Array([0] => ) so this code can't work : if (('' === $value) && !$this->isRequired() && $this->getAllowEmpty()) { return true; }

So I changed this code : foreach ($value as $val) { if (('' === $val) && !$this->isRequired() && $this->getAllowEmpty()) { continue; } if (!$validator->isValid($val, $context)) { $result = false; $messages = array\_merge($messages, $validator->getMessages()); $errors = array\_merge($errors, $validator->getErrors()); } }

Hopping it's can help you...

This will not work; the code indicated does not happen in a loop, so calling continue simply continues execution of the method -- which breaks most behavior of the method.

The report does not include a full example of the problem for reproducing the issue, so closing.
