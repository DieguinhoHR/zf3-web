### Description

I'm using partialLoop with array that originates from MongoDB, so its structure is as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $model = array(
        0 => array('_id' => '4e9d6f2dd434488c1baf024a', 'otherKey' => 'otherData'),
        1 => array('_id' => '4e9d6f2dd434488c1baf0246', 'key' => 'data'), // And so on
    );


When I call

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->partialLoop('mypartial.phtml, $model);


I get an exception {quote} Zend\_View\_Exception: Setting private or protected class members is not allowed in /library/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 815 {quote} I found out that this is because of underscores in array keys (i.e. keys '\_id' which are natural for MongoDB data). I also tried it with other keys with underscores (just to make sure '\_id' doesn't conflict with some inherited field or something), like '\_dummyKey', and it didn't work either. Perhaps this issue is not very serious, but it makes working with MongoDB data quite tedious.

This is especially annoying given the fact that you can't opt to not return the \_id field in a Mongo query, so the only solution is to loop over the result and unset this field. Tedious indeed!

Seconding this issue. It is quite frustrating (although work aroundable), particularly for someone brand new to working with ZF.

There are 3 solutions I can think of to get the correct behaviour. 1) Use Reflection to check if the variable is indeed private/protected (ignore the \_ prefix) (may have some performance impact, will still object to actual conflicts between user variables and private/protected variables).

2) use Magic Getter/Setter functions to move user supplied variables to a seperate name space (e.g. array etc) (no idea what the impact of this would be)

3) prevent direct assignment ($view->var) require use of $view->assign(), and set user variables into an array or simmilar for retreival with another function. (this will break a lot of peoples scripts).
