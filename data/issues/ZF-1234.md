### Description

When using prepared statments and executing the same sql query with different bound params it is prepared everytime it is executed.

In Zend/Db/Statement/Mysqli.php starting on line 136

if the following code is moved into a constructor for the class

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sql = $this->_joinSql();
    $this->_stmt = $mysqli->prepare($sql);


and create a constructor to look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($connection, $sql)
    {
         parent::__construct($connection, $sql);
    
         $s = $this->_joinSql();
         $this->_stmt = $this->_connection->getConnection()->prepare($s);
    }


After making these changes the prepared statement runs as expected, verfied in the query log.

This is my first bug report so I hope I followed all the rules.
