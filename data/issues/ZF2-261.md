### Description

When using a factory method with a parameter definition to create a class the factory method will be called twice:

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array(
        'di' => array(
            'definition' => array(
                'class' => array(
                    'MyClass' => array(
                        'instantiator' => array('MyClass', 'create'),
                        'methods' => array(
                            'create' => array(
                                'param'       => array('type' => 'MyOtherClass', 'required' => true),
                            ),
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
     );


MyClass will be created during Di::newInstance by Di::createInstanceViaCallback(). If the instantiator method is "\_\_construct" the "\_\_construct"-method will be removed from the array of possible injection methods ($injectionMethods). If the instantiator is something different, the method (in the example "create") will NOT be removed. So the method is called again from Di::handleInjectionMethodForInstance() which results in a second instance of MyClass.

I am closing the related pull request, with the information above, this is hard to follow your use case, can you provide more information and/or a unit test?
