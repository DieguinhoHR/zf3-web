ZF-10141: Dojo() failing to fully initiate dojo
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-07-12T13:17:44.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:38:02.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

On some pages, the statement echo $this->dojo fails to produce the following code:

dojo.addOnLoad(function() { dojo.forEach(zendDijits, function(info) { var n = dojo.byId(info.id); if (null != n) { dojo.attr(n, dojo.mixin({ id: info.id }, info.params)); } }); dojo.parser.parse(); });

This appears to prevent dojo from loading properly and dojo elements on the page are not functional. However, dojo.require("dijit.xxxx") are still shown in the html code. It seems like the initiation of dojo is only partial. On other pages, within the same application and controller, all of the code is generated just fine and dojo is functional. .

Could you provide more detailed information?

When it fails and when it works fine.
