### Description

nick@pixelnix.com writes:

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle->limit() can get called with $count=0 and $offset=0. For example, set up a new model that extends Zend\_Db\_Table and implement some finder method that uses Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchAll() but omits the optional $count and $offset parameters. This in turn calls \_fetch() passing NULL in $count and $offset, and again in turn calls $select->limit($count, $offset) [Zend/Db/Table.php, line 397].

The NULL values are, I think, transformed into the value (int)0 by Zend\_Db\_Select->\_\_toString() during which it calls $this->\_adapter->limit() with the zero values [Zend/Db/Select.php, line 159 thru 169]. But unfortunately, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle->limit() takes these zeroes and creates a query string that looks like "select zsubselect2.\* from ( ..... ) zsubselect2 WHERE zrownum BETWEEN 0 and 0".

To sum up: if you're using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle for your Zend\_Db\_Table subclass model, and you call Model->fetchAll() without specifying $count and $offset, you will get zero rows back. So far my fix is to add this at the start of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle->limit(): if ($count == 0 && $offset == 0) return $sql;

Please provide a short but complete reproduce code, so that I can check if I can replicate the issue with the latest version.

The usage case described is tested in tests/Zend/Db/Table/TestCommon.php, methods testTableFetchAll(), testTableFetchAllWhere(), testTableFetchAllOrder(), etc.

These tests pass when run against both the OCI8 adapter and the PDO OCI adapter.
