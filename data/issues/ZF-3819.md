### Description

When cloning a single sub form to attach repeatedly in Zend\_Form, the names update, but the ids do not. As an example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    $subForm->addElement('text', 'foo');
    
    $form = new Zend_Form(array('action' => '/foo/bar', 'method' => 'post'));
    
    for ($i = 1; $i < 4; ++$i) {
        $name = 'sub' . $i;
        $sub  = clone $subForm;
        $form->addSubForm($sub, $name);
    }
    
    echo $form->render(new Zend_View);


This will result in the output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


` `     
    
    
     
     
    
    
     
     
    
    

As can be seen, the names are correct, but the ids are not.

The issue was that cloning was not cloning the elements, display groups, or sub forms. This is now resolved in trunk and 1.6 release branch.
