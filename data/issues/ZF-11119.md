ZF-11119: Wrong user binding after authorization
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-02-27T21:14:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-02-27T22:37:57.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap and after wards trying to use the LDAP adapter for other operations, the binding to the LDAP is wprng.

$objAuth = Zend\_Auth::getInstance (); $objAdapter = new Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap ( $arrOptions, $strUsername, $strPassword ); $mixResult = $objAuth->authenticate ( $objAdapter );

and then

$objAdapter->getLdap ()->update ( $strDn, $arrNewProperties );

The user binded at the update operation is not the user from the config settings for LDAP operations, but the user authenticated earlier.

in order the adapter to be binded correctly the workaround is calling the bind method before the update:

$objAdapter->getLdap ()->bind (); $objAdapter->getLdap ()->update ( $strDn, $arrNewProperties );

This is the intended behavior - so this is not considered an issue.

The intended workflow is to rebind with bind() after authentication - or use a different LDAP connection alternatively.
