The documentation for loadClass is now in Zend\_Loader.xml.

I have reformatted the line of example code mentioned above so that it is more clear that the two paths are different. It now reads:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Container_Tree',
        array(
            '/home/production/mylib',
            '/home/production/myapp'
        )
    );
    
    ?>

Add Zend\_Loader to components.
