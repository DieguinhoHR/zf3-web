### Description

Currently Zend\_Auth\_Adapters\* and Zend\_Auth\_Result attempt to pass failure reasons as stings back to the user to do with as they wish. This behavior actually impedes the development process when a developer wishes to pass customized messages back to the site user. Currently, in order to implement said feature on a site, the developer must open the adapter, find the result strings that would be returned in the result object during a specific failure type, and translate it to the developers wording before passing it onto the user.

The following patch/fix will provide easier use of the result object AT ZERO COST and COMPLETELY BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. It adds only 1 method to the result object getCode().

This fix will also aid developers when writing their own set of adapters as it relates to identifying all the different types of result failures they will have to code for in their custom adapter.

Code proposed here: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Auth/ResultProposed.php)

This fix of bringing result codes to the result object can also aid the developer in creating a more secure web applications in general, for example: locking a login attempt to 3 tries at a password invalid failure code. There are more, but you get the idea.

The following userland pseudo-code would be possible

$result = $auth->authenticate($adapter);

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    switch ($result->getCode()) {
       case Zend_Auth_Result::FAILURE_IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND: /** do stuff **/; break;
       case Zend_Auth_Result::FAILURE_INVALID_CREDENTIAL: /** do other stuff **/; break;
       case Zend_Auth_Result::SUCCESS: /** do successful stuff **/; break;
    }


If any of this needs clarification, please let me know. -ralph
