### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_\_construct() throws both Zend\_Db\_Exception and Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception, but the phpdoc says it only throws Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception.

 

 

### Comments

Updated the constructor to throw proper exception.

Fixed in trunk in r18632, and in 1.9 release branch in r18633
