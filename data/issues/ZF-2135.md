ZF-2135: Zend\_Locale\_Data::getContent() contains invalid implode() calls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Lines 263-265 of Zend\_Locale appear to be incorrect usages of the PHP implode() function. Both calls (lines 263 and 265) pass a string as the only parameter of implode(); this leads to the PHP Warning "Argument to implode must be an array."

I would like to propose the following corrections:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // line 263:
                    $val = implode('_', $value);
    // line 265:
                $id = 'Zend_Locale_' . $locale . '_' . $path . '_' . $val;


Note that the second implode() call has been removed entirely, as it looked to me like it was a leftover redundancy from some time in the past before line 263 was what it is. If I'm wrong about that, I apologize.

In any case, these changes appear to remove the problem, as the new code is producing valid output without the warning messages.

Thanks!

Please have always a look in the actual trunk before writing issues.

The codelines you are referring to are since 5 weeks:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //line 263
                    $val = implode('_' , $value);
    // line 265
                $id = strtr('Zend_Locale_' . $locale . '_' . $path . '_' . $val, array('-' => '_', '/' => '_'));


Closing issue due to already fixed within the trunk.
