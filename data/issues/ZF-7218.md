### Description

22.2.14, has two examples of filter usage.

$filter = new Zend\_Filter\_RealPath(); $path = '/www/var/path/../../mypath'; $filtered = $filter->filter();

should actually read as:

$filter = new Zend\_Filter\_RealPath(); $path = '/www/var/path/../../mypath'; $filtered = $filter->filter($path);
