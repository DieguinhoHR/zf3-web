### Description

When enabling keepalive connections, things actually seem to run slower (and not faster as expected).

Code should be profiled to see if there is anything that could be refactored.

Seem to only happen during unit tests (very fast requests to the same local machine, object being destroyed and recreated - not a real use case).

Benchmark shows Keepalive being more than x2 faster on average when performing ~20 consecutive requests to the same server (Google Images).

Closing as "Not an Issue"
