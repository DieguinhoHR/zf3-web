ZF-8489: Zend\_Validate\_Callback does not propagate context
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-07T08:16:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-12-08T10:06:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.0 (27/Jan/10)

### Description

According to Reference Guide ยง23.3.3, note "Validation Context" - "Zend\_Form\_Element::isValid() supports an additional argument, $context. Zend\_Form::isValid() passes the entire array of data being processed to $context when validating a form, and Zend\_Form\_Element::isValid(), in turn, passes it to each validator."

The current trunk version of Zend\_Validate\_Callback does not propagate this optional context to the callback.

The manual section you are referring to is from Zend\_Form.

Note that $context is only used and valid for Zend\_Form but not for Zend\_Validate.

Closing as non-issue.

Note that there is already a proposal written which should act as gateway/validator for context.

Thomas -- Please pass $context if available on to the callback so end-users do not need to build their own validators.

Yes, this may be Zend\_Form specific, but there's no reason on generic validators such as this not to honor it. If the callback does not accept the parameter, it will simply be ignored.

I still don't see this being a bug of Zend\_Validate\_Callback.

Although I agree with you Thomas, I have to side with Matthew on this. The lack of context propagation unnecessarily limits the usefulness of the validator. For instance, I've patched my version of Zend\_Validate\_Callback to pass on the context and wrote the classic "do the passwords match on this form" validation as a one-line static method on the controller rather than a separate class.

I'm happy for this issue to be reclassified as an enhancement if that is more appropriate.

Fixed this bug with r19529. (In my eyes this is still a feature request and not a bug!)

Note that this change breaks BC and is therefor not backported to 1.9.

Thank you, Thomas
