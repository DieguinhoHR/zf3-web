ZF-5236: Tokenized fiels in Zend\_Search\_Lucene strip numbers from words

### Description

When using a tokenized field with Zend\_Search\_Lucene, whenever you add a field that contains words with numbers on them, the numbers are removed. Unfortunately, for my project, I need tokenized fields with words containing numbers being treated as words. Is there a way of doing this, and is this supposed to happen at all?

I'll attach an example of a query that isn't working.

Hi Vincent, in Reference Manual you can learn, that default analyzer doesn't treat numbers as part of terms ([[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.charset.html#zend.search.lucene.charset.default_analyzer)]). You can use another analyzer this way:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(
        new Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8Num()
    );


You can find more analysers in Zend/Search/Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common/. Remember also to build index using specified analyser.

The default text analyzer of Zend\_Search\_Lucene is

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_Text\_CaseInsensitive

which ignores numbers completely

If you execute:

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer::setDefault( new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_TextNum\_CaseInsensitive() );

before adding the document and searching the index (or just at the very beginning) numbers will be treated as ordinary characters and part of words.

Suggestion: Mark the Bug as Invalid / WontFix and possibly make a note in the documentation, there seem to be wuite a number of people stumbling into this pitfall ;)
