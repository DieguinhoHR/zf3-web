ZF-5106: Incorrect path to SQLite database file

### Description

In the QuickStart on the "Create a Model and Database Table" page in the app.ini code sample the following line incorrectly references the SQLite database file:

database.params.dbname = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook.db"

I believe it should be:

database.params.dbname = APPLICATION\_PATH "/data/db/guestbook.db"

Also, the paragraph following the bootstrap.php code sample should also be modified if the database is actually located in the /application/data/db/ directory and not the application/data/ directory as the page states.

I seem to remember your saying the SQLLite path in the QuickStart didn't need to be changed. Is this correct?

It indeed needs to be corrected. I just noticed that after getting errors from the load script.

Um.... the directory structure is this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    quickstart/
    |-- application/
    |-- data/
    |   |-- db/


This is the recommended project directory structure per our manual. As such, having the following configuration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.db.params.dbname = APPLICATION_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook.db"


is correct. I've also tested it, and the code works correctly.

Closing as non-reproducible.

Yes, the path is correct if you put your data directory outside the application directory, but the problem is in this paragraph where it states that the data directory is INSIDE the application directory:

"At this point we have a connection to a database; in our case, its a connection to a Sqlite database located inside our application/data/ directory. So, let's design a simple table that will hold our guestbook entries."
