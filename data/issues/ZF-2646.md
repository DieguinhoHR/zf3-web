The option for isEmpty check in Alnum validator should be optional because. Not there is problem with combining it with StringLength because of duplicate error about string emptiness and length.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Use "allowWhiteSpace" on the Alnum validator to accept/disallow whitespaces. Use the "breakChainOnFailure" option on any validator to prevent the next validator from being executed.

So I think it's better to use something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    addValidator('StringLength', true, $options);


(note the true which prevents the next validation), instead of promoting a new option only for a single validator.

Closing for the reason as described before
