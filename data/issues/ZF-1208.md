### Description

I can't use a ";" inside the translated string because it is the separation character in csv files. Is it possible to add an escape way to use ";" in translated string ?

Fixed with SVN 4426.

Double the separator to include him into the string.

"Message;;1;Nachricht1" => "Message;1" -> "Nachricht1" see documentation for details.

Also added the possibility to change the separator to any other wished sign.
