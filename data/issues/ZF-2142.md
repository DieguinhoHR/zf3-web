### Description

Currently the where method of Zend\_Db\_Select allows to call the where() method with a second parameter that gets quoted substituted into the first parameter and replaces the placeholder (question mark). Since the where() method can be called multiple times, multiple parameters can be quoted.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()
        ->from("products")
        ->where("product_name = ?", $prod)
        ->where("price < ?", $minimumPrice)
        ->orWhere("price > ?", $maximumPrice);


Unfortunately this usage makes it more difficult when you need to evaluate Boolean expressions in a specific order. In certain cases it becomes necessary to use the non-quoted format in order to clarify the query because AND has higher precedence than OR. Quoting must be done separately.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $minPriceQuoted = $db->quote($minimumPrice);
    $maxPriceQuoted = $db->quote($maximumPrice);
    $select = $db->select()
        ->from("products")
        ->where("product_name = ?", $prod)
        ->where("price < $minPriceQuoted OR price > $maxPriceQuoted");


If the where() method accepted multiple parameters for quoting, the usage would be much less awkward:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()
        ->from("products")
        ->where("product_name = ? AND (price < ? OR price > ?)", $prod, $minimumPrice, $maximumPrice);
