### Description

It seams that Zend\_Date has problems to work with dates after 31 Dec 2037 in UTC+0 time zones. It starts to shift time -1 hour.

Example of this issue is reproduced here <http://www.k2s.sk/grid/date.php> and I am pasting the code also here:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require "Zend/Date.php";
    
    // don't use locale detected from browser to understand month names
    require "Zend/Registry.php";
    $locale = new Zend_Locale("en_GB");
    Zend_Registry::set("Zend_Locale", $locale);
    
    function tryDates($dates)
    {
        echo "<b>converting dates:</b> ";
        foreach ($dates as $str=>$expected) {
            $date = new Zend_Date($str); 
            $day = $date->get("yyyy-MM-dd");
            if ($day!=$expected) {
                echo "<span style="color:#FF0000;">$day</span>";
            } else {
                echo "<span style="color:#008000;">$day</span>";
            }
            echo " (".$date->toString(Zend_Date::ISO_8601)."), ";
        }
        echo "<br></br>";
    }
    function runTestInTimeZone($timeZone)
    {
        date_default_timezone_set($timeZone);
        echo "

### `time zone: ".date_default_timezone_get()."`

    ";
        echo "loop for dates in years 2037-2050:<br></br>";
        for ($y=2037; $y<=2050; $y++) {
            $y_1 = $y-1;
            tryDates(array("31 Dec $y_1"=>"$y_1-12-31", "1 Jan $y"=>"$y-01-01", "5 Jan $y"=>"$y-01-05"));
        }
        echo "";
    }
    
    echo <<Zend_Date time zone problem

Your example give an exception:

"Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Date\_Exception' with message 'Unable to parse date '31 Dec 2036' using 'dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss' "

This is no problem of Zend\_Date as you define to use dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss bus you give dd MMM yyyy.

Reducing from Critical to Minor... Example failes by design.

Thomas, have you visited my working example at <http://www.k2s.sk/grid/date.php> ?

The code should work for you if you change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date($str);


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date($str, "dd MMM yy"); 


_Zend\_Date is not reliable on future dates and that is in my opinion critical bug._

The error you are getting is not relevant to the problem I am describing and which is easily to see at <http://www.k2s.sk/grid/date.php>. I think it is caused by some locale configuration differences.

I found the problem, I am trying to show here, on many forums, but without solutions. The time is shifted in Europa/London timezone in very strange way on some dates.

_I think it is caused by some locale configuration differences._ - is related to the error you are getting with my code, I don't know why Zend\_Date has problems with some dates in some timezones.

Also the online example fails by design. It returns the same exception as when running it locally.

ok, I tested the example with IE set to use Language germany and you are right it fails, because of the Month name parsin.

I added following code to force Zend\_Date to use english to parse the month names:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // don't use locale detected from browser to understand month names
    require "Zend/Registry.php";
    $locale = new Zend_Locale("en_GB");
    Zend_Registry::set("Zend_Locale", $locale);


It should work now for you now here: <http://www.k2s.sk/grid/date.php>

If for any other reason it will not work, pls. download the output here: <http://www.k2s.sk/grid/dateproblem.pdf>
