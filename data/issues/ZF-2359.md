there is no "else" statment:

                        }


// MAKE NEW INSTANCE AND SECOND CALL

Removing Zend\_Json\_Server as component; Zend\_Json\_Server has not been in a public release yet, and is being re-written from the ground up as a JSON-RPC implementation for the next minor release.

Scheduling Zend\_Rest\_Server fix for next mini release.
