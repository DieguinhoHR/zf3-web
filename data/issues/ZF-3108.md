### Description

Hi, I found some improvements to add to different Zend\_Log files.

First, the $event treated in Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Abstract and all its children should be casted to Array in the function definitions ( for safety ).

Second, I think that Zend\_Log should be iterable to give back the Writers it has been provided, and additionaly all the writers should be "toStringable" to reflect the name of their own class

Same for Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Mock : it should be recursive Iterable so that a simple foreach loop on it would give back all the messages it's been containing.

All those patches are ready in my local copy and waiting for approvement.

I can as well take care of the other improvements asked for that component, such as ZF-2618 that could lead to a warning show if default timezone has not been set in PHP, ZF-2428 as well....

Let me know.

Hi Julien, I'm reviewing improvements to Zend\_Log for 1.8 now. I'll get back to you on the separate suggestions soon, but please remember to create one issue for each feature request in the future. It will make it much easier for us to handle them separately.
