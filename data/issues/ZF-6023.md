ZF-6023: Zend\_Locale doesn't consider current locale as default for translations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-13T08:19:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-13T10:31:46.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.7 (16/Mar/09)

### Description

The translation functions of Zend\_Locale access itself statically and the functions that do so don't take the current locale into consideration when no locale parameter is passed. This causes problems with the current example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once('./Zend/Locale.php');
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('es');
    
    echo 'Current Language: ' . $locale->toString() . "\r\n";
    echo 'Actual Result: ' . $locale->getLanguageTranslation('es') . "\r\n";
    echo 'Should Output: ' . $locale->getTranslation('es', 'language', $locale->toString()) . "\r\n";
    
    ?>


which results as

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Current Language: es
    Actual Result: Spanish
    Should Output: espaÃ±ol


This makes using functions like Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList() more difficult to use since you have to constantly pass $locale->toString() in the locale parameter which seems very unnecessary.

How should a static method know the data within a instance ?

As you can see within the API and the manual getTranslation and all it's derevates are static methods. When you are not giving the locale, and are not setting a application locale, how should the static method know for which instance you want to have the locale ?

The correct handling is described within the manual and the API. This is not a bug, this is correct OOP behaviour.
