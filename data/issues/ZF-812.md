### Description

nick@pixelnix.com writes:

There seems to be an issue with Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle->fetchAll(). The behavior behind this function is not consistent with the documented usage of Zend\_Db\_Rowset and Zend\_Db\_Row. Again when a Zend\_Db\_Table model uses Zend\_Db\_Table->fetchAll(), eventually this method will be called with $style = Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ASSOC. The Rowset object being created expects to iterate the results of the query as an array containing 1 row (nested sub-array) per element. But Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle->fetchAll() in this case passes only the flag OCI\_ASSOC to oci\_fetch\_all() - and this will not return a result in the expected format.

The Rowset object will then never be able to retrieve its expected data during its current() method. So far my fix is to add this to Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle->fetchAll() at line 307:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    case Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC:
        $flags |= OCI_ASSOC;
        $flags |= OCI_FETCHSTATEMENT_BY_ROW;
        break;


I'm not sure yet how the $style parameter to this method is being set, but I suspect that OCI\_FETCHSTATEMENT\_BY\_ROW needs to be the _default_ value for $flag whenever $style != Zend\_Db::FETCH\_OBJ, so that in all cases it will be applied to oci\_fetch\_all().
