ZF-6284: Zend\_Service\_Twitter authentication mixup

### Description

I have 2 Zend\_Service\_Twitter objects, both with their own account credentials. After sending an update with one object, an update on the next object will use the wrong useraccount.

E.g.

$a = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter("userA", "passwordA"); $b = new Zend\_Service\_Twitter("userB", "passwordB");

$a->status->update("This is a test"); $b->status->update("This is a test too");

// result, both messages get posted in userA's timeline.

I investigated a bit further, and the problem probably is is that Zend\_Service\_Abstract, which Zend\_Service\_Twitter is indirectly derived from, uses a protected static $\_httpClient member to handle rest calls. This is probably a design flaw, since this could lead to a number of problems where various different objects could inadvertently get unexpected results, since they share a single common http client object.

Actually Zend\_Service\_Twitter does not extend Zend\_Service\_Abstract. It extends Zend\_Rest\_Client as it's using their REST API. This might be a design flaw in the Rest Client but with no maintianer of the Rest Service I'm not sure how/if this will ever get fixed. I think the twitter client should get a rewrite and us the Zend\_Service\_Abstract method instead but that would push it off to 2.0.. I'll send this off to Zend to see what they say.

Actually it is; which is why I said 'indirectly'.

Zend\_Service\_Twitter extends Zend\_Rest\_Client, but Zend\_Rest\_Client in turn inherits from Zend\_Service\_Abstract. (I think composition would be a better design for the service api than inheritance by the way).

So the problem is still with Zend\_Service\_Abstract and its static $\_httpClient member. Does Zend\_Service\_Abstract have a maintainer?

Ahh see if i would have followed the tree all the way i found i found that. My mistake. I have a feeling that it doesn't reset the variables like it should. I ran into this problem with the Ec2 Component where if you did more than one request it would fail as the $\_httpClient was tainted with the previous requests items.

I'll look into this further.

Yes, that's indeed another symptom of the same issue. I think the cleanest solution is to replace the static $\_httpClient with one that is not shared between instances, in other words a protected member variable.

I just ran into the same problem and after some looking around, I found a workaround which worked for me. Before every statusUpdate() call, I did:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $twitter->setPassword($twitter->getPassword());


That did reset the \_authInitialised, so it updated the HTTP client when doiung the next statusUpdate().

Thanks Ben. I can confirm that this indeed is a working workaround.

The disadvantage is that this causes a re-authentication upon every update, even if they are from the same account. While this is acceptable in my situation, this is something to take into account if you do high volumes of updates.

This patch implements some changes in an effort to ensure each Zend\_Service\_Twitter instance uses a distinct local HTTP client object to prevent the conflcts noted above. The summary of changes:

1. Implement a new Zend\_Service\_Twitter::getLocalHttpClient() method used in unit tests to test the response.
2. Clones the statically set or retrieved Zend\_Http\_Client as a local object protected property for the life of the object.
3. Adds four short protected methods partially duplicating REST preparation from Zend\_Rest\_Client (required since the originals are either final or private). The duplication is minimal.

Note: This allows the setting of a custom client statically, so long as you remember they are cloned once a new object is created (i.e. you cannot change the clients once the object is instantiated which does differ from previously)

Padraic,

It looks good to me. Let me konw when this is in so I can update the block addition for this and get it committed.

Thanks for the patch, as soon as I have a chance I'll test it in a real world scenario.

Hi Jon,

I can commit the patch this afternoon if it looks fine.
