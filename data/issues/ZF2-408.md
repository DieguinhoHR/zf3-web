### Description

We have this Segment route configured;

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    /contact[/:action[/:mode]][/page/:page]


Which works OK for:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    but NOT for: 

I assume this is a bug in the Segment route?

Could you please be more specific than just "doesn't work"?

Sorry, it results in a 404 Error (The requested controller was unable to dispatch the request.)

Could you please post the complete route definition, including options?
