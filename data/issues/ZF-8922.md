ZF-8922: Adding an Anchor property to Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc

### Description

Currently, Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc has no way of appending an anchor link, such as <http://example.com/About#who>, without subclassing the framework, or using the more general but less useful Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Uri.

I think it'd be a good idea to add an "anchor" field to Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc. That way, the above url could be generated from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Blah
        Aboutindexwho

This feature is still missing in 1.10.

The patch should include the following points:

- Zend\_Navigation\_Page gets a new property "anchor" and getter and setter for this property
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract::htmlify uses the new property from the page
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract gets a new option to the output of anchors to skip

_Update:_

This is not an "anchor"! It is a "fragment identifier".
