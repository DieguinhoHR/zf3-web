### Description

When submitting empty form. The value of the field created by Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor instead of being empty contains the value:

I found a solution here: [http://journaldeguillaume.blogspot.com/2010/02/â€¦](http://journaldeguillaume.blogspot.com/2010/02/corriger-le-bug-zend-dojo-editor-sous.html) It's as simple as adding filter to editor:

->setFilters(array('StringTrim', array('PregReplace',array('#  
\#i','')) ))

But I guess this bug should be solved anyway. Regards, Greg

Firefox 3.6.10

it's similar to the bug: <http://zendframework.com/issues/browse/ZF-8707> but i'm not sure if these are the same things as the author seems to focus on another thing.

I've been looking into this for a while now, looks like Firefox adds that BR tag on it's own. Googling/IRCing didn't help. Same issue also appears/appeared in editors like CKEditor and FCKEditor.

The following code snippet/patch shows how we could fix this, but this looks hacky/dirty. Also it breaks one test (testHelperShouldCreateJavascriptToConnectEditorToHiddenValue); that test tests for the line which is edited/deleted in the patch bellow.

Patch actually looks reasonable; the functionality that exists is largely due to inconsistencies in how browsers handle textarea submissions coming from non-textarea input.

I've applied the patch to trunk and the 1.11 release branch, along with test modifications.
