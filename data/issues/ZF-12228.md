### Description

Just search Zend/Service/WindowsAzure sources for those:

Zend/Service/Console/Command.php Zend/Service/Console/Exception.php Zend/Service/Console/Exception.php Zend/Service/Log/Formatter/Interface.php Zend/Service/Log/Writer/Abstract.php Zend/Service/Log/Exception.php Zend/Service/Management/Exception.php

- Zend/Service/Log/Formatter/Interface.php
- Zend/Service/Log/Writer/Abstract.php
- Zend/Service/Log/Exception.php
- Zend/Service/Management/Exception.php

Fixed on trunk (25284) and on release-1.12 branch (25285)

- Zend/Service/Console/Command.php
- Zend/Service/Console/Exception.php
- Zend/Service/Console/Exception.php

What is this? There is no "Console"! Any Ideas or comments?

By the way, the Zend/Service/WindowsAzure component is very ugly:

- Method calls outside a class
- Sample files in library
- Wrong coding format (we have a coding standard!)
- ...

It would be best to leave WindowsAzure out - the SDK is on the GitHub <https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-php>

@[~mhujer] Thanks for your very fast feedback! :)](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_WindowsAzure)

I think, this would be a good solution. I will speak with Matthew, because on Github we still have [ZendService\_WindowsAzure.

I'm not sure about the current quality of the SDK included in ZF, but when I tried Azure approx. 2y ago, I had to use the standalone SDK, because the one in the ZF worked with outdated service API.
