ZF-3743: ShortWords token filter not working with utf-8 charset
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-07-24T12:44:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:37.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When using the ShortWords token filter with the UTF-8 Analyser, it fails to skip tokens containing UTF-8 characters.

For example, with a length of 2, the token "Ã " (common in french) is not skipped because strlen returns 2.

The solution would be to make a ShortWordsUtf8 that uses iconv\_strlen instead of strlen.

Working ShortWordsUtf8 using iconv\_strlen instead of strlen (based on ShortWord.php from release-1.5.2)
