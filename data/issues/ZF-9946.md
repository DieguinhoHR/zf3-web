### Description

_Problem:_ After a call to Zend\_Form->\_sort() the function Zend\_Form\_Element->setOrder() does not work anymore for elements already in the form. (The function \_sort() is called when iterating over the form.) This is a problem when for example you want to insert an element before or after an element you searched for (by iterating) in the form.

_Result:_ Form elements without an order specified are implicitly given an order inside Zend\_Form->\_sort() and are placed in the Zend\_Form->\_order array. This enables overwriting of form elements while this is not clear to the user. This can be achieved by specifying an order for a new form element which has been implicitly taken by an element without an order set. This is not obvious to the user/developer.

_Reproduce:_ Basic form: This only shows element 'elt\_one'

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt_two', array('label' => 'Elt 2:'));
    foreach ($form as $f) {
        // To trigger Zend_Form->_sort()
    }
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt_one', array('label' => 'Elt 1:'));
    $form->getElement('elt_one')->setOrder(0);
    echo $form;


A more "real-world" scenario: This gets sorted in the wrong order and deletes a form field (field 'elt6')

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt1', array('label' => 'Elt 1:'));
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt5', array('label' => 'Elt 5:'));
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt6', array('label' => 'Elt 6:'));
    foreach ($form as $f) {
        // To trigger Zend_Form->_sort()
        // One might iterate over the form to find a place where to insert a new element
    }
    $form->getElement('elt1')->setOrder(1);
    $form->getElement('elt5')->setOrder(5);
    $form->getElement('elt6')->setOrder(6);
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt2', array('label' => 'Elt 2:'))->getElement('elt2')->setOrder(2);
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt3', array('label' => 'Elt 3:'))->getElement('elt3')->setOrder(3);
    $form->addElement('text', 'elt4', array('label' => 'Elt 4:'))->getElement('elt4')->setOrder(4);
    echo $form;


_Possible solution:_ An implementation of Zend\_Form->\_sort() where it first orders the elements for which an order is set in the element itself and after that inserts the other elements in the first available empty spots.

In Zend/Form.php line 3278:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _sort()
    {
        if ($this->_orderUpdated) {
            $items = array();
            $noOrderSet = array();
            $index = 0;
            foreach (array_keys($this->_order) as $key) {
                $order = $this->{$key}->getOrder();
                if (null === $order) {
                    $noOrderSet[] = $key;
                } else {
                    $items[$order] = $key;
                }
            }
    
            foreach ($noOrderSet as $key) {
                while (isset($items[$index])) {
                    ++$index;
                }
                $items[$index] = $key;
                ++$index;
            }
    
            $items = array_flip($items);
            asort($items);
            $this->_order = $items;
            $this->_orderUpdated = false;
        }
    }


While I think this is a better implementation, it still doesn't re-order the elements after something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->getElement('elt1')->setOrder(4);


Removing the "if ($this->\_orderUpdated)" check in \_sort() and order the elements every time would solve this but it's not efficient because \_sort() is called quite a lot. Implementing something like Zend\_Form->\_needsOrderUpdate() might ease the performance hit a little. Zend\_Form->\_needsOrderUpdate() would check if elements have a set order, and if that order matches the order in the Zend\_Form->\_order array.

To prevent having to do this check, the order should really be kept and changed in the Form object and not the Form\_Element object. This would require quite a change in the API however.

I would like to solve this issue myself, but I'm not sure which solution to pick (and whether it is to be solved at all)

Confirm, this is a problem, and as it cannot be resolved within 1.10.\* branch i am postponing this atm. A possible solution requires either Zend\_Form\_Elements holding the instance of the form they are attached to, or a refactoring to set the Order of the Elements through the Form they are attached to.
