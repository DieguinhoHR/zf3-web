### Description

In some environments you may set form data with null values instead of empty strings. Currently the semantic from the BaseInputFilter is, that null is a value and the input is not excluded from the filter if $required == false.

This is the relevant snippet from BaseInputFilter::isValid()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $input = $this->inputs[$name];
                if (!array_key_exists($name, $this->data) || (is_string($this->data[$name]) && strlen($this->data[$name]) === 0)) {
                    if($input instanceof InputInterface) {
                        // - test if input is required
                        if (!$input->isRequired()) {
                            $this->validInputs[$name] = $input;
                            continue;
                        }
                        // - test if input allows empty
                        if ($input->allowEmpty()) {
                            $this->validInputs[$name] = $input;
                            continue;
                        }
                    }
                    // make sure we have a value (empty) for validation
                    $this->data[$name] = '';
                }


This is not what I would expect and I'm not sure if this is an issue or not. But adding $this->data[$name] === null would be easy and has afaik no side effects.

Can you try this with current master, please? I believe we had a patch for this very issue in the past week.
