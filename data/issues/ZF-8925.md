### Description

now: $options = $this->mergeOptions($this->\_loadConfig($options['config'], $options));

should be: $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $this->\_loadConfig($options['config']));

The same problem with array loader.

Actually, options passed in via the constructor _should_ have precedence over those found in the configuration file, as they represent the greatest level of specificity. This is no different than applications that run on the CLI; options in the dotfile would be overridden by options passed via the CLI; in this case, the dotfile is our config file and the CLI is the script invoking Zend\_Application.
