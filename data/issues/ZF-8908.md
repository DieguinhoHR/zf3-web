### Description

I got some errors starting with Cannot redeclare class I started to get rid of them one by one using if (class\_exists) cases, so I'm not sure which one was first but it was likely Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Abstract.

After a lot of headache, I figured the problem might be, that zf.bat (@ G:\\www\\zf\\zf1.9.7\\bin) started to work on G:\\www\\zf\\zf1.9.7\\library and than it started using the G:\\www\\myproject\\library folder after the script found my project. To make it worse I didn't copy the library folder into my project folder but used junction for emulating symlinks.

The problem described above might not be exact or completely even wrong, but if you find yourself in a situation like this, here's my solution: - I removed the library folder from my include path completely, and put zf.bat and zf.php into my project folder. I should have moved it into my application folder to make it magicly work, but I felt that to be a bit dirty, so I changed zf.php on line #158 to bq. $zfIncludePath['relativePath'] = dirname(**FILE**) . '/library/'; I suppose this should always work.

Changed component to Zend\_Tool and assigned to Ralph.
