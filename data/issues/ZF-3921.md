### Description

Conditional comments are handy not only for links but also for scripts and stylesheets. As HeadScript and HeadStyle by default only allow W3C standard attributes, you could potentially use 'conditional' in the attribute array. Then simply add the following just before the return statement in itemToString():

 
    <pre class="literal">
            if (isset($item->attributes['conditional'])
                && (false !== $item->attributes['conditional'])) {
                $html = '';
            }
