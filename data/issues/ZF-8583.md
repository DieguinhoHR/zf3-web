### Description

Beside services and models, you may want to store your own mappers in your modules as well. Thus the module resource autoloader should also have a "mappers" => "Mapper" directive in its standard definition.

As we currently have Model\_DbTable mapped to models/DbTable we would probably either want to map Model\_Mapper to models/Mapper, as Ralph would agree, but I still think that mappers belong to their own directory in the modules' root.

This topic needs further discussion.
