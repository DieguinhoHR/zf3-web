### Description

Currently, the windows azure tests impact the running of all Zend\_Service\_\* tests when attempting to run via TestConfiguration.php.dist.

Issues: \* Hard dependency on TestConfiguration.php.dist from test class needs to be removed \* Suites should not take **CLASS** as a parameter \* Running outside the phpunit executable is not fully supported in ZF so static code can be removed \* Tests should be off by default, and those off should be marked as skipped (not not loaded). \*\* Test cases that are skippped should also skip the setup and teardown routine \* A readme should be created so demonstrate how-to run these tests
