ZF-7863: Zend\_Date::addDay() does not add the correct number of days until the next dayname
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Zend\_Date API states that: {quote}"addDay('Montag', 'de\_AT'); will add the number of days until the next monday"{quote}

However, when using a dayname, the dayname number (i.e. Friday => 5) is added to the date instead of the difference between the current and until next dates.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('09/16/2009', null, 'en_US'); 
    
    echo $date->toString(Zend_Date::RFC_2822) ; // Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:00:00 -0400
    
    $date->addDay('Friday');
    
    echo $date->toString(Zend_Date::RFC_2822); // Mon, 21 Sep 2009 00:00:00 -0400
    
    // Expected +2 days, i.e. Fri, 18 Sep 2009 00:00:00 -0400 
    // Resulted +5 days, i.e. Mon, 21 Sep 2009 00:00:00 -0400


I traced this issue down to lines 1461-1483 of Zend\_Date::\_calculate(). This code segment does not account for the relative difference between daynames. (Likewise, this issue affects Zend\_Date::subDay() too.)

The method works exactly as expected...

Adding 2 days to Monday results in Wednesday

Adding Monday to Monday results in Tuesday: Reason:

Monday = Day 1 of the week (Sunday is 0)

Monday + 1 day = Tuesday.

So looking at your example the result is correct: Adding friday is like adding 5 days as friday is day 5 of the week.

Expected behaviour, closing as non issue.
