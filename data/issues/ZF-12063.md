ZF-12063: Zend\_Date::subMonth() - Strange behavior on february
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-02-16T12:36:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-02-16T13:04:08.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Date offers different methods to help working with dates. One of them is the "subMonth" method.

I have been using this method to work trough dates and performing DB queries. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2012-03-01 00:00:00');
    $lastMonth = $date->subMonth(1); //Expected value is '2012-02-01 00:00:00'


This works for every case, except when the date is 'YEAR-02-01 00:00:00'. In the case the date is February 1st, the date returned it January 1st of the previous year.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2012-02-01 00:00:00');
    $lastMonth = $date->subMonth(1); //Resulted value is '2011-01-01 00:00:00'


Interesting fact is if you continue to iterate trough this, the date gets back to normal, but it will fail in every February 1st.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2012-02-01 00:00:00');
    while ($months++ < 24) {
        echo $date->toString('YYYY-MM-dd') . '<br></br>';
        $date->subMonth(1);
    }


This will output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    2012-02-01
    2011-01-01 << Wrong year
    2011-12-01
    2011-11-01
    ...
    2011-03-01
    2011-02-01
    2010-01-01 << Wrong year
    2010-12-01
    2010-11-01
    ...


I noticed others strange behaviors, but I was unable to replicate as this.

The file version is described as: \* @version $Id: Date.php 22713 2010-07-29 11:41:56Z thomas $ It's the version included in the Magento library.

I have upgraded this component to the 1.11.10, and the problem seems to persists. \* @version $Id: Date.php 24108 2011-06-04 00:09:27Z freak $

Added code example showing strange behavior during a while loop.

Reviewing the timestamps, they seems to be right. The problem might be related to the output.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [1328054400] => 2012-02-01 00:00:00
    [1325376000] => 2011-01-01 00:00:00 << Wrong year
    [1322697600] => 2011-12-01 00:00:00
    [1320105600] => 2011-11-01 00:00:00
    ...
    [1296518400] => 2011-02-01 00:00:00
    [1293840000] => 2010-01-01 00:00:00 << Wrong year
    [1291161600] => 2010-12-01 00:00:00
    ...
    [1264982400] => 2010-02-01 00:00:00
