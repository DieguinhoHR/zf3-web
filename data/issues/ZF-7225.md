Could you please provide a code example of what you were doing, what you have received and what you expected to receive?

Please refer to the 104Kb arrayOfObjects.PNG instead of the 85Kb one.

The mysql result handler fetches result using mysql\_fetch\_assoc while iterating through the rows of the result. It would be great if it could use mysql\_fetch\_object and then set the types of each of the fields of the fetched object.

Switched to return objects.
