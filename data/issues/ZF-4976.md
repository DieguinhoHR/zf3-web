Here's an initial patch that adds folder creation support.

Once you patch this in, you can also move and delete folders relatively easily with code outside the Gdata library.

Hi Matthew, Thanks for the patch. Unfortunately, before we can accept your contributions, you need to sign and submit the Zend Framework CLA. This can be found here:

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)

Once this is done and you're added to the _zf-framework-dev_ group in JIRA, let me know and I'll process this patch.

Hi Trevor,

My CLA has been accepted and Hilary has added my account to the contributor group. Please proceed with processing this patch. Thanks!

Thanks Matthew. A couple of suggestions/comments.

- DOCUMENTS\_FOLDER\_FEED\_URI should not have a trailing '/folder'
- It would be nice to have an additional (optional) argument $resource\_id for creating a folder within another folder. This is similar to creating documents in folders: [http://code.google.com/apis/documents/…](http://code.google.com/apis/documents/docs/2.0/developers_guide_protocol.html#UploadingToFolder)

public function createFolder($folderName, $folderResourceId=null) { ... if ($folderResourceId != null) { $uri = self::DOCUMENTS\_FOLDER\_FEED\_URI . '/' . $folderResourceId; } else { $uri = self::DOCUMENTS\_LIST\_FEED\_URI; } return $this->insertEntry($entry, $uri); }

You could additionally allow $folderResourceId to be a full URI ([http://docs.google.com/feeds/folders/…](http://docs.google.com/feeds/folders/private/full/folder/folder%3A1234))

Hi guys,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to this. I've implemented Eric's suggestions (thanks Eric) and have attached an updated patch.

Would be great to see this in the next release.

Cheers, Matt

Hi Matt. Looks good. Just a few comments from me.

Looks good to me.

Hi guys, I've updated the patch file to include your comments. Hope that makes integration easier.

 

 

Posted by Trevor Johns (tjohns) on 2010-01-06T11:57:35.000+0000

One last change. I'll just go ahead and make this for you.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     /**
    + * @see Zend_Gdata_App_Extension_Category
    + * @see Zend_Gdata_App_Extension_Title
    + */
    +require_once 'Zend/Gdata/App/Extension/Category.php';
    +require_once 'Zend/Gdata/App/Extension/Title.php';


Each @see line needs to come immediately before it's respective require\_once line.

As it currently stands, Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Category will have too "See Also" lines in it's documentation, and Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Title will have none.

Commited to trunk as r20112. Scheduled for next minor release. Thanks for the patch!

I've created ZF-8732 to track some additional changes that need to be made to this, but that don't block integration.
