ZF-4350: Reference Guide Section 8.5.8 "Subclassing the Router" is outdated

### Description

See the following:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.subclassing)

[http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/…](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Controller/Router/Zend_Controller_Router_Interface.html)

The reference guide maintains that Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface only requires a single method, route(), whereas the API documentation indicates an additional method assemble() (declared by Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface and not implemented by Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Abstract) is required.

This reference guide section also lacks documentation on the abstract router component. I think its presence warrants at least a small note in this section. An explicit indication of what it implements with respect to the interface requirements would also be useful.
