ZF-11650: MVC view scripts do not preserve line breaks

### Description

I use a ZendMVC Application to write text based config files for a nagios system. A view script is used as a template and filled with values from the controller side. If the last character on a line is a closing php tag ?> the following new line gets lost in the rendered output.

Example: Keyword: <?= $sKeydata ?> Keyword: <?= $sKeydata ?>

Becomes:

Keyword: KeydataKeyword: Keydata

This is a limitation of PHP, and how it handles newlines following a closing "?>" tag. There are two workarounds:

- add whitespace following the closing tag prior to the newline
- add an extra newline

Won't fix, as the only viable solution is pre-parsing view scripts, which would impose a huge performance cost, as well as introduce a significant BC break.
