Here is the patch to add this ability to Zend\_Feed.

Then it is very easy to use. You just have to implement Zend\_Feed\_Interface or to give an appropriate array to Zend\_Feed::factory method.

 
    <pre class="highlight">require_once 'Zend/Feed.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Feed/Interface.php';
    
    class MyInterface implements Zend_Feed_Interface
    {
        public function getFeedData()
        {
            $array = array('title' => 'A feed produced by the Zend_Feed_Interface',
                           'link' => '<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>',
                           'description' => 'Description of the feed',
                           'author' => 'Olivier Sirven',
                           'email' => 'olivier@elma.fr',
                           'charset' => 'iso-8859-15',
                           'lastUpdate' => time(),
                           'entries' => array(array('title' => 'First article',
                                                    'link' => '<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>',
                                                    'description' => 'First article description',
                                                    'content' => 'First article <strong>content</strong>',
                                                    'lastUpdate' => time())));
    
            return $array;
        }
    }
    
    // create the input array describing the feed to create
    $array = array('title' => 'Title of the feed',
                   'link' => '<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>',
                   'description' => 'Description of the feed',
                   'author' => 'Olivier Sirven',
                   'email' => 'olivier@elma.fr',
                   'charset' => 'iso-8859-15',
                   'lastUpdate' => time(),
                   'entries' => array(array('title' => 'First article',
                                            'link' => '<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>',
                                            'description' => 'First article description',
                                            'content' => 'First article <strong>content</strong>',
                                            'lastUpdate' => time())));
    
    // create a Zend_Feed_Atom instance from the array
    $feed = Zend_Feed::factory('atom', null, $array);
    
    // create a Zend_Feed_Rss instance from it
    // $feed = Zend_Feed::factory('rss', null, $array);
    
    // create a Zend_Feed_Rss instance with Zend_Feed_Interface
    // $feed = Zend_Feed::factory('rss', new MyInterface());
    
    // dump the feed to standard output
    // print $feed->saveXML();
    
    // send http headers and dump the feed
    $feed->send();

Comments:

The Zend\_Feed class already has importUri(), importString(), and importFile(). What about using two new static methods: importArray() and importBuilder() instead of the factory() method you propose.

The importArray() method uses the $data value as you have it above. The importBuilder() method uses the object of type Zend\_Feed\_Interface.

I would suggest making the format be the optional second argument, and it defaults to 'atom'.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $feed = Zend_Feed::importArray($data, 'atom');


I would suggest changing Zend\_Feed\_Interface to Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Interface, and provide a simple reference implementation Zend\_Feed\_Builder, which takes an array in its constructor, performs some minor validation, and then can be used in the importBuilder() method.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $builder = new Zend_Feed_Builder($data);
    $feed = Zend_Feed::importBuilder($builder, 'atom');


This plain Builder class is not very interesting, but serves as a concrete implementation to demonstrate the usage. Users are encouraged to make their own classes to implement Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Interface.

Why would $data or $builder be optional? That is, why do you default them to null? Wouldn't it be better to make them required arguments?

I don't understand the patch to Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket. Doesn't it duplicate code that exists just a few lines later?

I meant Zend\_Feed has a method import(), which takes a URI argument. It's not called importUri().

Here is a new version of the patch taking into account your suggestions. The new usage is now

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /* create a Zend_Feed_Atom instance from the array */
    $feed = Zend_Feed::importArray($array);
    
    /* create a Zend_Feed_Rss instance from it */
    $feed = Zend_Feed::importArray($array, 'rss');
    
    /* create a Zend_Feed_Atom instance with Zend_Feed_Builder */
    $feed = Zend_Feed::importBuilder(new Zend_Feed_Builder($array));


Sorry about the patch to Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket. It was an older patch I submited and I forgot the revert the code ;)

Thanks for the patch Olivier. I have tried this in an application of mine and it works a treat.

I did have a couple of thoughts/suggestions - this mostly applies to the RSS implementation, as I haven't tried Atom:-

- Currently the feed builder assumes 'rss' or 'atom' with a switch statement. For future compatibility, wouldn't it be better to use Zend::loadClass and throw an exception of the class is non-existent rather than limiting it to the switch?
- Perhaps some defaults would be good here for building, rather than throwing an exception if feed elements are missing (e.g. lastUpdate defaults to time() if not explicitly mentioned).
- The element names don't always correspond to the specifications. For example 'entries' should be 'items' in the RSS version. An exception should be thrown if 'items' is not set.
- 'charset' doesn't really belong in the feed element entries. Perhaps the signature of Zend\_Feed\_Builder could instead be \_\_construct function(array $array, $charset = 'iso-8859-1') so the charset is specified there instead?
- The RSS feed didn't allow for enclosures (I was making a podcast so I did miss it a lot!). Perhaps the value for an enclosure can be an array, so we can specify the length, mimetype and url?
- The 'guid' element is optional, so shouldn't be created by default.
- 'source', 'category', 'author' and 'comments' are missing from the items definitions
- There are also elements missing from the channel definition (see <http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss>)

Look forward to seeing this implementation included (hopefully) by 0.9.

Cheers!

Thanks for your comment Simon.

- I have changed Zend\_Feed::importArray and Zend\_Feed::importBuilder to use Zend::loadClass instead of a switch statement.
- The support of rss and atom format is now (I hope so) complete so you can add your podcast to your rss feed ;)
- I have added support for the WFW api too so one can link a rss/atom entry to an associated rss/atom feed
- The guid node of a rss item is now only created if an id is specified
- About the element names of the builder array, I tried to pick the most speaking word from rss or atom format as this array represent as well a rss feed or an atom feed. That's why the charset value is a key of the array: the array should contains all values needed to generate a feed, whatever the output format is.

Please give a try to the current version located here [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/branch/Zend_Feed) and tell me what you think.

Regards,

Olivier

I think I am almost done...I have added support for the itunes extension (rss only) and the unit tests have been completed to support the new features As far as I know I just have to complete the existing Zeed\_Feed documentation and I will be done!

Before these changes may be merged to core, the unit tests must pass.

I received the following fatal error on PHP 5.1.4 on WinXP. I also have a confirmed report of the same results on PHP 5.1.5 on WinXP:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Objects used as arrays in post/pre increment/decrement must return values by reference in
    ...\branch\Zend_Feed\library\Zend\Feed\Rss.php on line 214

Oup's I did not test with php 5.1.x, only with with php 5.2.x :( I have made some changes in order to make the thing work so I'd like you to test it again ;) Or maybe you can tell me where I could do it myself without removing my current php installation ?

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2007-03-14T12:58:40.000+0000

Sorry for the delay; I see that the tests pass now, and I'll continue review pursuant to merging it to core. Thanks, Olivier, for these great new features! :)

My pleasure ;) Let me know if you need me to do something else

Branch merged to core with SVN [r3941](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=3941). Thanks, Olivier! :)
