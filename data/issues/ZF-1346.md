### Description

Given these two routes:

<http://ralphschindler.dev/index/my-path/> [http://ralphschindler.dev/index/my\_path/](http://ralphschindler.dev/index/my_path/)

Upon routing to and executing the valid action "myPathAction()", a $this->render() call will want to route to its respective script:

/index/my-path/ will try to get to view script: ./index/my-path.phtml /index/my\_path/ will try to get to view script: ./index/my\_path.phtml

One of the two will not exist. The action will be run, but the view will not be able to be found.

Perhaps some way to enforce word separation in view script path construction?

This will also fail on capitalization issues:

as /index/my-Path/ will throw this exception:

Zend\_View\_Exception::message[script 'index/my-Path.phtml' not found in path]

Resolved in r4847. Any word or path delimiter in the controller or action names will be normalized to a hyphen ('-') by getViewScript().
