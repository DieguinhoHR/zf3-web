### Description

See [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4213>]

There is a error when check the domain of a cookie, I finally found that exists an error in the comparition way.

Valid domain are:

.zend.com => must catch zend.com and anything.zend.com .<www.zend.com> => must catch <www.zend.com> and anything.<www.zend.com>, this's not work right now.

Invalid domain are:

.com.ar .or com. or .com => the script doesn't check this. zend.com without initial dot.

This is the code that fails online 235:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Domain is validated using tail match, while path is validated using head match
            $domain_preg = preg_quote($this->getDomain(), '/');
            if (! preg_match('/'.$domain_preg.'$/i', $uri->getHost())) return false;


Here's a improve solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Domain is validated using tail match, while path is validated using head match
            $domain_preg = preg_quote($uri->getHost(), '/');
            if (! preg_match('/\.'.$domain_preg.'$/i', $this->getDomain())) return false;


Regards.

This is somewhat improved after fixing ZF-5221 in rev. 17079 - but we still can't filter out .com or .co.ar domains - that would require quite a lot of work. I am also not sure it's the work of the cookie jar to filter those - maybe if Zend\_Http\_Client.
