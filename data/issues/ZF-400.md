Not yet.

And it's not mentioned in dev-notes yet ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend_Search)).

Do you see it important?

For me, is very needed ;) Currently our team is implementing Zend\_Search with an DBA Layer and there the Lucene handles the searches. That is why, i will have to think somehow (or try myself) to implement it.

Can you give any dates for the end of those implementations (ranges search) ?
