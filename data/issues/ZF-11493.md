### Description

Have a Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Property to create @property in doc blocks as well. Auto generated @property's good drasticly improve ease-of-coding. Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Property code should completely identical to Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param; better integrate param/property functionality into Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag and use Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param. Use Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Docblock\_Tag\_Property as a kind of type selector. This would also improve the handling of tags for you wouldn't have to switch between various types of tags.
