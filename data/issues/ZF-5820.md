----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Attempting to store and re-use a Zend\_Gdata service instance across a session results in an error.

When running the attached test case, the first attempt to retrieve a calendar succeeds. However, subsequent attempts (which require re-loading the service instance from $\_SESSION) result in the following error:

 
    <pre class="literal">Fatal error: main() [<a href="function.main">function.main</a>]: The script
    tried to execute a method or access a property of an incomplete object. Please
    ensure that the class definition "Zend_Gdata_Calendar" of the object
    you are trying to operate on was loaded _before_ unserialize() gets called or
    provide a __autoload() function to load the class definition in
    /opt/local/apache2/htdocs/session_test.php on line 34

Are you trying to persist this between requests? Otherwise, I'd suggest you use Zend\_Registry.

Otherwise, check the following note: [http://de3.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.main.php#84229)
