### Description

I propose to change setIncludePaths to the following so absolute paths are being used. In my case i have an ini setting of resources.cache.defaultCachedir = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/cache/"

(Unless it's optimized in php, but i don't think so) it will evaluate this every try on an include.

[code] public function setIncludePaths(array $paths) { $path = implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, array\_map('realpath', $paths)); set\_include\_path($path . PATH\_SEPARATOR . get\_include\_path()); return $this; } [/code]

It will be problematic if you are adding the '.' path, but since this method only adds paths to the current include\_path it would never occur since (at least i expect) that path is already in place.
