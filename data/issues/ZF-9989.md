### Description

This is really really small sugestion how this method could get improved. Now it takes two types of arguments: Zend\_Db\_Select or integer. It would be nice if it would accept string containing integers like "54" and not just plain integers 54. I came accross this problem when I called this method with result of some count query.

// old lines } else if (is\_integer($rowCount)) { $this->\_rowCount = $rowCount; } else {

// replacement lines } else if (is\_integer($rowCount) || preg\_match('#^\\d+$#', $rowCount)>0) { $this->\_rowCount = (int)$rowCount; // (almost) save cast } else {

This way programmer wouldn't have to worry to cast string to integer on method invocation.

It is not this component's responsibility to cast input types: the user must take care of the type casting.
