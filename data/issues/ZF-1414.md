### Description

Given the following bootstrap:

/\* set base URL \*/ $baseurl = Zend\_Registry::get('config')->deploy->baseurl; if (!empty($baseurl)) $controller->setBaseUrl($baseurl);

$controller->setRouter($router); $controller->setControllerDirectory('../application/default/controllers'); $controller->setDefaultAction('index'); $controller->throwExceptions(true); $controller->dispatch();

...with base URL being "/mh/" for instance, the request URL <http://localhost/mh/polls> throws the following exception:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception' with message 'Invalid controller specified (oll)' in /app/test/local/lib/ZendFramework-0.9.3-Beta/library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php:173 Stack trace: #0 /app/test/local/lib/ZendFramework-0.9.3-Beta/library/Zend/Controller/Front.php(754): Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard->dispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http), Object(Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http)) #1 /docroot/virtualhosts.d/test/mh.test.kargo.com/htdocs/index.php(35): Zend\_Controller\_Front->dispatch() #2 {main} thrown in /app/test/local/lib/ZendFramework-0.9.3-Beta/library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php on line 173

PollController exists, but it tries to look for ollController, with the P truncated.

<http://localhost/mh//polls> actually works.

I figured out the problem:

I was proxying the request through mod\_proxy, so when the Request object sets the pathInfo, it cuts too much off the string, because $requestUri does not contain the baseUrl, however the links generated for references withing the app must be relative to basePath.

Example ProxyPass <http://proxy/mh> <http://local> HTTP GET <http://proxy/mh/polls>

What I could do is not set the basePath, and make a view helper that generates links relative to a "proxy-base-path", but I guess that makes things also a little inconsistent.

Any suggestions?

thanks

Florian

Assigning to Matthew.

I'd definitely go the view helper route to ensure the links are generated correctly; you can always disable it or have it pass the links unfiltered once you move off the proxy.

Since this is a fringe case and next-to-impossible to test for, I'm going to close as won't fix. Feel free to contact me if you need help with the view helper.

Issue is the result of a very non-standard setup (serving via mod\_proxy), and will require the developer solve the situation at the view level as it's next-to-impossible to test (depends on mod\_proxy setup).
