### Description

As outlined on the mailinglist, do we really need prepared statements in this adapeter? Most people argue that you need them to counter XSS but Zend\_Db uses quote-functions internally anyhow. I just know that prepared statements are a severe performance hit.

I think this adapter's usage of prepared statements is off here.
