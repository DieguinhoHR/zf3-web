ZF2-363: Zend\\Mail\\Header\\MimeVersion should use "MIME-Type" instead of "Mime-Type"

### Description

In ZF1 this header was named "MIME-Version". In ZF2 this has been changed to "Mime-Version". Mail headers are case-insensitive, but who knows how many buggy clients are out there and the RFC uses "MIME-Version", too: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045>

The affected methods are "getFieldName" and "toString".
