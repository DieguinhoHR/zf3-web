### Description

Hello, I will be happy if anyone would tell me any infos.

I find a Documentation Team page has garbled letters. For example, [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Japanese+(Nihongo)) .

In the last week, some user asked me to re-write the page with Japanese letters. I could find the page to be successfully written at that time, but I find the page is garbled today.

Is it truth that we can use UTF-8 support in Documentation Team page? It is said in Translation Teams section, [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Documentation+Team)

I hope it could also help other languages users.

Is this still the case with the new jira release? I was not able to reproduce this problem in IE and FF today.

Thank You for comment and trying to reproduce. I can ensure this issue is solved in new jira. :-)
