### Description

Ok, I don't know if you'd call this an error or not, but once again it is something that is bound to be very confusing to people just starting. And if ever there is a time to NOT confuse people just starting, it would be in the "Quick Start" tutorial.

After this instruction:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ; application/configs/application.ini
    
    ; Add to [production] section:
    resources.layout.layoutPath = APPLICATION_PATH "/layouts/scripts"


The app is broken and throws a fatal "uncaught exception error" as follows:

bq. Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script 'layout.phtml' not found in path (D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\application\\layouts\\scripts\\;D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\application\\layouts\\scripts\\;D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\application\\views\\scripts)' in D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\View\\Abstract.php:925 Stack trace: #0 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\View\\Abstract.php(828): Zend\_View\_Abstract->\_script('layout.phtml') #1 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Layout.php(791): Zend\_View\_Abstract->render('layout.phtml') #2 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Layout\\Controller\\Plugin\\Layout.php(142): Zend\_Layout->render() #3 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Plugin\\Broker.php(330): Zend\_Layout\_Controller\_Plugin\_Layout->postDispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http)) #4 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Front.php(956): Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Broker->postDispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http)) #5 D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Application\\Bootstrap\\Bootstr in D:\\webdev\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\View\\Abstract.php on line 925

Once again, I'm sure (or not) this all gets resolved further in the tutorial, but anyone testing as they go is now going to spend half an hour trying to figure out what they did wrong. To instill confidence, new users following the instructions perfectly should have perfect results. At the very least, the exception should be caught and the error properly formatted and displayed with something useful and perhaps even have the "if you tested now you'd see [...] because [...]"

ps. Why in the world is a PHP platform... nay, THE php platform.... using a JAVA-centric issue tracker?

Closing as not reproduceable

Running the command "zf enable layout" there are no failures regardless of the used php release.

Probably no longer an issue
