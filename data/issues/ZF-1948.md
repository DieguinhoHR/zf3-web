### Description

The [Zend\_Config documentation](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.html) contains an example of how to load a new Zend\_Config object with a PHP array, but it does not demonstrate how to have a separate configuration file that contains the PHP array.

Provide an example that shows how this can be done.
