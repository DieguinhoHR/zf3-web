### Description

h4. Problem In the documentation it states the config var as masterFile, while in the class, it breaks coding standards and has it has master\_file. It is the same with a few other vars in there.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Available options
         * 
         * ====> (string) master_file :
         * - the complete path and name of the master file 
         * - this option has to be set ! 
         * 
         * @var array available options
         */
        protected $_specificOptions = array(
            'master_file' => ''
        ); 
        
        /**
         * Master file mtime
         * 
         * @var int
         */
        private $_masterFile_mtime = null;
