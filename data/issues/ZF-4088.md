ZF-4088: CSV adapter and Subversion meta folders

### Description

The CSV adapter recurses through the directory it's been provided, which includes .svn folders. This folder can sometimes contain previous, unchanged copies of translation files. These files are parsed last, so they overwrite any previous key entries and lead to a lot of confusion.
