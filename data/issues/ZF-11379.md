### Description

Due to requirements of some site which aggregates my feed I need to remove CDATA from category tag in rss feed. This section inserted in method Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Renderer\_Entry\_Rss class::\_setCategories(). So i decide to extend this class and modify method. This class initialized for every entry in rss feed on method Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Renderer\_Feed\_Rss::render(). Class Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Renderer\_Entry\_Rss hardcoded there, so calling of this class can't be modifeied. It will be useful to set class name "Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Renderer\_Entry\_Rss" as protected property of class Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Renderer\_Feed\_Rss, how it done in Zend\_Db component with rows and rowsets. It will be easy to change entry renderer class just extending feed renderer class and modifying protected property.
