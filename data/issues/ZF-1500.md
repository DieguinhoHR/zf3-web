### Description

There is a small problem with the \_quote() function in the DB2 adapter when sing the version of the ibm\_db2 driver which does recognize the db2\_escape\_string() function. While the $value is escaped, it is not quoted, so the same value gets returned unchanged. To fix it, you just need to add the " ' " character, similar to what is done in the parent class. I copied the change here, plus I am attaching the changed file.

if (function\_exists('db2\_escape\_string')) { return "'" . db2\_escape\_string($value) . "'"; } return parent::\_quote($value);
