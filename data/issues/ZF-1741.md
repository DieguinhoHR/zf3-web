### Description

according to spec RSS2.0 (<http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification>) we can have the date : "Sat, 07 Sep 2002 00:00:01 GMT"

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $zdate = new Zend_Date("Sat, 07 Sep 2002 00:00:01 GMT",Zend_Date::RSS);  // should work


it corresponds to old notation of RFC\_822 and it seems to be valid in RSS...

RSS specification says also we can also use 2 digits for years : "Sat, 07 Sep 02 00:00:01 GMT"

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $zdate = new Zend_Date("Sat, 07 Sep 02 00:00:01 GMT",Zend_Date::RSS); // should work


Regards, Philippe

Zend\_Date is not supposed to work with RSS 2 nor is this anywhere written in the docu. It does a compare to the date format as supported by PHP itself (date constant DATE::RSS)
