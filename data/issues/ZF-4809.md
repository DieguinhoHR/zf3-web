ZF-4809: Zend\_Validate\_Ip detects 1.2.333 as valid IP
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Validate\_Ip detects 1.2.333 as valid IP as this, in case of ip2long() IS a valid IP (1.2.1.77), but in case you want the user to enter a full IP this is an invalid IP. A better check would be: if(ip2long($valueString) === false || long2ip(ip2long($valueString)) !== $valueString) as this checks that the specified IP is exactly the same as the one returend from long2ip().
