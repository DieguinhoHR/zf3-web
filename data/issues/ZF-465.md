ZF-465: Redirection handler issue in Zend\_Http\_Client
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-10-30T05:41:44.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:24.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

Some requests can cause a redirection loop. I try to make a GET request on the url: <http://bonnetdane.midiblogs.com/>. In this case, the Zend\_Http\_Client sends a request for the URI "/?". The call returns a redirection to the url: <http://bonnetdane.midiblogs.com/index.html> so the Zend\_Http\_Client send another request for the URI "/index.html?". The calls returns a redirection to the url: <http://bonnetdane.midiblogs.com/index.html> and so on. However, if the request is for the URI "/index.html" the server does not send back a redirection answer. I have tried to use the new Zend\_Http\_Client in the incubator but there is the same issue.

A small example to show the problem with netcat:

$ nc bonnetdane.midiblogs.com 80 GET /? HTTP/1.0 Host: bonnetdane.midiblogs.com

HTTP/1.1 302 Found Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2006 10:36:24 GMT Server: Apache Vary: Host Location: <http://bonnetdane.midiblogs.com/index.html> Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

$ nc bonnetdane.midiblogs.com 80 GET /index.html? HTTP/1.0 Host: bonnetdane.midiblogs.com Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 302 Found Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2006 10:43:19 GMT Server: Apache Vary: Host Location: <http://bonnetdane.midiblogs.com/index.html> Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

$ nc bonnetdane.midiblogs.com 80 GET /index.html HTTP/1.0 Host: bonnetdane.midiblogs.com Connection: close

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2006 10:44:23 GMT Server: Apache Vary: Host Last-Modified: Mon, 30 Oct 2006 10:44:28 GMT Connection: close Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Hi,

Do you have any possibility to test the issue with the incubator version of the Http\_Client ? It will soon replace the old Http\_Client, and I would like to spend as much less time as possible on fixing bugs in the old client.

Thanks.
