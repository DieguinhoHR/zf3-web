### Description

Result set is sorted by score by default. It's also possible to specify field name(s) for sorting and sorting options. If field values are the same then hits are sorted by document id. It would be good to sort it by score first.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
