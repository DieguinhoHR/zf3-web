### Description

The HeadLink View Helper does not allow the "id" attribute. This makes it impossible to include Mozilla Bespin via the HeadLink helper, as it is dependent on using the id attribute. Using the id attribute on link elements is valid, and I can see no reason why this was not included. There are also several other use cases, such as determining if a link has already been included by using a id for it.

I have already created a patch which I use for every new release of Zend Framework successfully: <http://gist.github.com/539147>
