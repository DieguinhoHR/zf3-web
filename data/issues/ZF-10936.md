ZF-10936: CookieJar doesn't allow to disable encoding of cookies.

### Description

When cookies are added normally througt Zend\_Http\_Client, (e.g. Zend\_Http\_Client::setCookie()) then Zend\_Http\_Client::fromString() is used which offers the option to disable encoding through the $encodeValue parameter.

However, when a Zend\_Http\_CookieJar is used, cookies are set through Zend\_Http\_CookieJar::addCookie(), which doesn't offer the option. The result being that if you use a CookieJar, you have no control over whether or not the cookies are encoded. This is a problem since CookieJar::addCookiesFromResponse() sets cookies from strings using Zend\_Http\_CookieJar::addCookie().

This can be fixed in a backwards compatible manner by giving addCookie() an extra optional parameters that allows to define whether the value should be encoded.
