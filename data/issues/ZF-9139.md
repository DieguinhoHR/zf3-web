While an interesting idea, I personally don't want to force this sort of functionality on our users. Advertising what framework the site is built in also aids in automated attacks, particularly if there are known exploits for specific versions of the framework. In this regard, it would have enormous security implications, and would be fairly unconscionable of us to promote.
