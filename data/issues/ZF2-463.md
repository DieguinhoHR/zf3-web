### Description

If you create a Zend\\Navigation\\Navigation using the DefaultNavigationFactory, the Router and RouteMatch are automatically injected into every MVC page.

However, if you subsequently add MVC pages to the Navigation using the Navigation::addPage method, the Router and RouteMatch are not injected for you. You can set a default router on Zend\\Navigation\\Page\\Mvc, but you have to set the RouteMatch manually every time.

Would you please consider making one of the following modifications:

1. Change Zend\\Navigation\\Page\\Mvc so you can specify a default RouteMatch as well as a default Router.
2. Change Zend\\Navigation\\AbstractContainer so that it automatically injects the Router and RouteMatch on every call to addPage.

Many thanks!

I think your first suggestion is a good idea.
