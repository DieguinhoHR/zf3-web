### Description

Hello,

i use Zend\_Form myself in this form:

$phone = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('phoneNr'); $phone->setLabel('phoneNr'); $phone->setFilters(array('StringTrim')); $phone->setValue($this->\_data->phoneNr); $this->addElement($phone);

When i want to add such a form element to a display group, i have to type the "id" of the element, instead of the variable:

$this->addDisplayGroup(array('phoneNr'), 'name', ...);

Better would be: $this->addDisplayGroup(array($phone), 'name', ...);

I think it would make sense to implement this functionality. Precondition should be that the element defined in the variable is already added to the Zend\_Form instance to be consistent with the current functionality.

I've uploaded a patch that enables this functionality, and a unit test.
