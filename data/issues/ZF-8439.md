ZF-8439: Lifetime expiration time of 0 should be considered as forever
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The function \_expireTime of Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File should be changed, so that a lifetime of 0 is considered (like null) to last forever.

This is the behaviour in PHP's sessions and thus one most likely expects other modules to work as well.

Moreover it's not possible to set a null-value if the cache is configured via an ini file.

That's a common behavior of all Zend\_Cache backends. So this modification changes API and breaks backward compatibility.

This issue can't be fixed in ZF1 because of bc.

It's no longer present in ZF2 because the ttl option is an integer and all adapters defines 0 as forever. (values lower than 0 throws an InvalidArgumentException)
