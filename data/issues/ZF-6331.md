### Description

||current||must be|| |Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract|Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap\_Abstract| |Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrapper|something like Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Interface| |Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_ResourceBootstrapper|something like Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_ResourceBootstrapper\_Interface| |Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap|something like Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap\_Abstract| |Zend\_Application\_Resource\_ResourceAbstract|Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Abstract|

And why are there such stupid (!?) class names like following?

||current||why not ...?|| |Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap|Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap| |Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract|Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Abstract|

We are revising the coding standards, and the new standards will be published in the manual for 1.8. There are several concerns:

- When we move to using namespaces: \*\* having a final segment of just "Interface" or "Abstract" will not work, as they are reserved keywords \*\* the interface and the framework's concrete implementations should be in the same namespace
- A desire to stay away from Hungarian Notation
- A desire to comply with forthcoming PEAR2 standards: \*\* [http://wiki.php.net/pear/rfc/pear2\_class\_naming](http://wiki.php.net/pear/rfc/pear2_class_naming)  
 \*\* [http://wiki.php.net/pear/rfc/â€¦](http://wiki.php.net/pear/rfc/pear2_naming_standards)

A summary of the new rules is as follows: \* Interfaces _must_ be named descriptively, and fall under the same namespace as implementations \* Abstract classes _should_ be named descriptively, but _may_ include the suffix "Abstract" as part of the classname \* Abstract classes _must_ fall under the same namespace as implementations

The reason we want the interfaces/abstracts to fall under the same namespace as implementations is to make it easy to package individual components, as well as to import and alias a single namespace .

To give an example, consider the following PHP 5.3 namespace-aware implementations:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    namespace zend\application\bootstrap;
    
    interface Bootstrapper
    {
    }
    
    abstract class BootstrapAbstract implements Bootstrapper
    {
    }
    
    class Bootstrap extends BootstrapAbstract
    {
    }


In a userland implementation, you might have the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    namespace website;
    use zend\application\bootstrap as App;
    
    class Bootstrap extends App\Bootstrap
    {
    }


These changes to the standards have been discussed on the zf-contributors mailing list.

Why then is Zend\_Application not Zend\_Application\_Application?
