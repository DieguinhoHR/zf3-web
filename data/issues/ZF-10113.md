### Description

Zend\_Auth/Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable doesn't return the id of the authenticated customer.

This means that as I STILL don't know which customer this is I would have to query the very same credentials again to attain the auto increment key I need to effectively log in.

I don't like modifying core files due to the problem of later updates but in this case I have.

I added a few lines to Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable.

1) New property - protected $\_result\_identifier = null;

2) setResultIdentifier($credential) method. ( sets the DB field to capture )

3) authenticate() ( capture the field from $resultIdentities and populate the new $\_result\_identifier

4) Add the captured id to messages with .. $this->\_authenticateResultInfo['messages']['returned\_id'] = $this->\_result\_identifier;

It would be far better with a propper integration ( messages should be numerically keyed ) but this works for now.

Closing as not an issue.

For support requests, please use either the mailing list or #zftalk on IRC. The dev tools are not a support forum.

The information you require is also available in the manual in the section entitled "Advanced Usage: Persisting a DbTable Result Object" in the page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.adapter.dbtable.html)

My apologies, I am new to ZF and still getting used to the tools available.

I thought I had checked well but obviously not nearly enough.
