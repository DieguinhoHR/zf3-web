### Description

[http://www.php.net/headers\_sent](http://www.php.net/headers_sent)

bool headers\_sent ( [string &file [, int &line]] )

I propose including the file and line in the exception messages generated by Zend\_Contoller\* relating to headers\_sent() returning true.

Assign Zend\_Controller issues to Matthew.

Resolved prior to 0.9.0; only location needing update was Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::canSendHeaders().
