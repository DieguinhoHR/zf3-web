ZF-5017: Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_SubmitButton() IsChecked() returns false
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Using the IsChecked() on a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_SubmitButton returns false if the name or id of it is different then the formname.

Problem lies in the automatic removal of the "name" attribute which is done by the dojo decorator.

Because the name is empty the returned value is empty and IsChecked returns false.

If I manually add the attribute: name="" in the rendered form using firebug and then submit the form IsChecked works as expected.

A test which proves that this is not an issue.

Robert -- tests aren't testing the value _after_ rendering. Can you add a test that renders the form with button, and then checks the button state?

Corrected the test case, hopefully it's OK now :)

Also, deleted the old test case.
