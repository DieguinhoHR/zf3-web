This is a quite big issue, need to implement a REST client for one of my clients, and they require a specific enctype to be set.

However, the above issue blocks me from implementing it with Zend\_Rest\_Client as the setRawData function call now clears my previously set enctype through self::getHttpClient()->setEncType('MY\_ENCTYPE')

Bart, you are right. We just fought like maniacs here trying to figure out why it wouldn't work, and patching Zend\_Rest\_Client as patched above worked first shot. Thanks but please fix in the core framework in 1.11.12.

Wouldn't it be better to change Zend\_Http\_Client's setRawData() ?

We don't need to overwrite the EncType there if it is NULL!

e.g.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    /**
         * Set the raw (already encoded) POST data.
         *
         * This function is here for two reasons:
         * 1. For advanced user who would like to set their own data, already encoded
         * 2. For backwards compatibilty: If someone uses the old post($data) method.
         *    this method will be used to set the encoded data.
         *
         * $data can also be stream (such as file) from which the data will be read.
         *
         * @param string|resource $data
         * @param string $enctype
         * @return Zend_Http_Client
         */
        public function setRawData($data, $enctype = null)
        {
            $this->raw_post_data = $data;
            if (!is_null($enctype)) {
                $this->setEncType($enctype);
            }
            if (is_resource($data)) {
                // We've got stream data
                $stat = @fstat($data);
                if($stat) {
                    $this->setHeaders(self::CONTENT_LENGTH, $stat['size']);
                }
            }
            return $this;
        }
