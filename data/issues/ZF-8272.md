### Description

The class Zend\_Validate\_PostCode is mentioned in the documentation ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.set.html#zend.validate.set.post_code)) but is not in the current download. I downloaded the zip; I didn't try the tar download.

The reference's manual was recently build on the trunk instead of the 1.9 branch. It's an 1.10 functionality.

Was this intentional or a mistake? Either way, it is confusing as 1.10 isn't live yet.

The manual within trunk describes also the features from trunk. The manual within branch 1.9 describes features from 1.9.

The problem is that the actual build process is wrong as it takes code from branch but manual from trunk.

A solution is already being worked on. Therefor closing as non-issue.
