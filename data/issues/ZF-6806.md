### Description

I'm developing a grid component on top of Zend\_Paginator and found myself in need for exactly the same pattern Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation uses, namely the proxy (my grid has a "renderer" concept which uses a proxied helper to do the rendering of the grid like TableGrid, ListGrid etc.) so had to copy-paste the functionality which isn't all that great. :) It would be great to just extend on this.

This is an interesting idea. Assigning to Matthew, because it has architectural implications beyond the navigational helpers.

The last minor release for Version 1 is just around the corner and so I see no chance for an implementation. Maybe a task for ZF2?
