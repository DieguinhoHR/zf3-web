### Description

Hello,

I use Zend\_Validate\_Date for validating a datetime field , by writting this :

$date->addValidator('Date', false, array('YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'));

But when validate for exemple: 2008-06-01 0d3:1d0:17 -> no error 2008-06-01 0sdg0:sdg03:0dd1 -> no error 020err0-08-06 01:00:00 -> error 200-08-06 01:00:00 -> no error

I can almast put what i want , error happen very rarely, i think there is a big problem concerning datetime validation!

Zend\_Date which Zend\_Validate\_Date build upon, is intelligent and does not make a string comparison.

It tries to detect if the string contains a date. Every non-digit sign is treated as seperator. Also dates are automatically fixed if possible and when they do not make sense.

Your first example will lead to the date: 2008 June 01 00:03:01 - non digits and treated as seperator Your second example will lead to the date: 2008 June 01 00:00:03 - non digits are treated as seperator Your third example causes a false because there is no month 0 !! - non digits are treated as seperator And your forth example will lead to the date 0200 August 06 01:00:00 - year 200 is possible so no failure

Keep in mind that dates are no strings. If you need to have a string comparision just use another validator.

If you make a date from this string you will get a proper output even if you seem not to have expected this. So if you want to do a string comparision you should validate for strings not for dates.

If you need a date string in a fixed format you should first do a string comparision and afterwards a date comparision. Something like \\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d-\\d\\d \\d\\d:\\d\\d:\\d\\d

Also to mention... if your date contains "June" instead of "06" it will also pass for a month.

As mentioned date validation is based on date detection and not on fixed string comparision.

Non digits are always used as seperators. If true is given, the string can be used as proper date input for Zend\_Date.

Use the regex validator if you need to validate a defined string format.
