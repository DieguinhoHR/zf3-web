ZF-4484: Locale data missing for LVL in lv\_LV and lt\_LT
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-04T04:56:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-10-04T15:38:06.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

This code throws the following exceptions:

 <?php require\_once "Zend/Currency.php"; var\_dump(new Zend\_Currency('LVL', 'et\_EE')); // Works as expected var\_dump(new Zend\_Currency('LVL', 'lv\_LV')); // Zend\_Currency\_Exception: Currency 'LVL' not found in.. var\_dump(new Zend\_Currency('LVL', 'lt\_LT')); // Zend\_Currency\_Exception: Currency 'LVL' not found in.. ?> Apparently locale data is missing for the currency 'LVL' (Latvian Lats) both in the Latvian locale (lv\_LV) and in Lithuanian locale (lt\_LT).

On closer inspection, lv.xml does contain but it only contains the element. Adding an appropriate elements solves the problem.

lt.xml does not contain any data for LVL.

As mentioned in the manual all data is based on CLDR from unicode. If there are missing informations they can only be added by unicode themself. (<http://www.unicode.org/cldr>)

We close this issue as it's not related to ZF itself and can not be solved by us.
