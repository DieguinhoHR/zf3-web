ZF-6055: Currency doesn't round correctly
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-18T04:46:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-30T06:32:34.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

When is use Zend\_Currency, the roundings are working incorrectly (imho).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $currency = new Zend_Currency('EUR', 'nl_NL');
    
    echo $currency->toCurrency('5.678', array('presicion' => 2));


I think it should display the number as: 5,68 but it is displayed as 5,67.

When looking in the code, the toCurrency uses the Zend\_Locale\_Format::toNumber(). Should it be using the toFloat() function instead?

S.

Use the correct option...

_precision_ instead of _presicion_

So I made a typo in the example... whoooo.

BUT!.... In my actual code it was/is the correct option (so no typo) thus the problem remains.

Looks for me as a duplication of ZF-3473 and ZF-5908. Using your example within my testbed I see no failed rounding using your input.

Are you sure that you are using trunk as you stated within the issue creation and not a fixed release ?

Did I state trunk? Hmz, must be sleeping :(

I was using 1.7.6, but I get the same results in 1.7.7.

This is the code that I use (just for testing!)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $curr = new Zend_Currency('EUR', 'nl_NL');
     $res = $curr->toCurrency(5.3678, array('display' => Zend_Currency::NO_SYMBOL));
     Zend_Debug::dump($res);


Going to test against trunk

Ok, I see that the code is working on trunk library.

When can we expect 1.7.8? ;-)

Sorry for the troubles! (and thanx for the solution).

I'll better my life by searching and filling the fields correctly.

Fixed for the next minor release (small BC break environment related)
