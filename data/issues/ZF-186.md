ZF-186: Add method Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchCol()

### Description

There are some wrapper functions absent from Zend\_Db\_Table, namely fetchCol() and fetchOne(). For people extending Zend\_Db\_Table, they may want to provide public methods such as findNames(), which returns a list of all the values in the 'names' column of a table. Currently, this function would look something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = $this->getAdapter();
    $select = $db->select();
    $select->from($this->_name, 'name');
            
    return $db->fetchCol($select);


People might find themselves writing this code multiple times over. What would be better is if fetchCol() was defined in the abstract Zend\_Db\_Table. Then, the findNames() function would be as simple as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return $this->fetchCol('name');


My proposal is to provide fetchCol() and fetchOne in Zend\_Db\_Table. The function takes a column and optional where clauses and order expressions, etc. It constructs the select object and returns the return of the appropriate call to the table's Db\_Adapter object.

Here are some functions that I believe should be in Zend\_Db\_Table. There is some code repetition, so they may not be optimal.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       /**
         * Fetches values from a column
         * 
         * @param string $col column name to fetch
         * @param string $where SQL composing optional WHERE clause
         * @param string $order SQL composing optional ORDER BY clause
         */
        public function fetchCol($col, $where = null, $order = null)
        {
            $db = $this->getAdapter();
            $select = $db->select();
            $select->from($this->_name, $col);
            
            if (!is_null($where)) {
                $select->where($where);
            }
            
            if (!is_null($order)) {
                $select->order($order);
            }
            
            return $db->fetchCol($select);
            
        }
        
        /**
         * Fetch the first row of the first column
         */
        public function fetchOne($col, $where = null, $order = null)
        {
            $db = $this->getAdapter();
            $select = $db->select();
            
            $select->from($this->_name, $col);
            
            if (!is_null($where)) {
                $select->where($where);
            }
            
            if (!is_null($order)) {
                $select->order($order);
            }
            
            return $db->fetchOne($select);
        }

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

Change summary, format description.

We're going to close this issue as "won't fix".

The reason is that fetch and find methods in Zend\_Db\_Table should all return objects of type Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row or Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset. Adding methods that return array primitives does not fit this pattern.

It's also unnecessary to provide these methods, because they are just proxies to the existing methods in the Zend\_Db\_Adapter class. It's easy to get access to the Adapter class from the table:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new MyTable();
    $result = $table->getAdapter()->fetchCol(...);


If this is absolutely needed in your environment, you can add the methods in your Table subclasses. Or else create a single abstract subclass and then derive your individual tables from the custom abstract class.
