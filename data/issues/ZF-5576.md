### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            include 'Zend/Loader.php';
            Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
      $pdoParams = array(
        PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_USE_BUFFERED_QUERY => true
    );
    
    $params = array(
        'host'           => 'localhost',
        'username'       => 'test',
        'password'       => 'xxxxxx',
        'dbname'         => 'test_db',
        'driver_options' => $pdoParams
    );
    
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('Pdo_Mysql', $params);
    
            $sql0="DROP TABLE IF EXISTS someTable";
            $sql1="CREATE TABLE someTable (id INT);";
            $sql2="INSERT INTO someTable (id) VALUES (1)";
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql0);
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql1);
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql2);


The above code works fine. However, attempting to execute more than one query in each exec() call does not:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $sql1="DROP TABLE IF EXISTS someTable; CREATE TABLE someTable (id INT);";
            $sql2="INSERT INTO someTable (id) VALUES (1)";
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql1);
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql2);


Execution of $sql2 fails with General error: 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active. Consider using PDOStatement::fetchAll(). Alternatively, if your code is only ever going to run against mysql, you may enable query buffering by setting the PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_USE\_BUFFERED\_QUERY attribute.

Note that

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $sql1="DROP TABLE IF EXISTS someTable; CREATE TABLE someTable (id INT);";
            $db->getConnection()->exec($sql1);


works fine on it's own - it's the subsequent call that fails.

This is more irritating than it appears, as it makes loading query data from files more fiddly - for instance in my unit test setUp() I have something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
          $sql = file_get_contents('createTestSchema.sql');
          $db->getConnection()->exec($sql);


where createTestSchema.sql consists of a number of CREATE TABLE & INSERT statements. This then basically kills the $db object - it can't be used for any other queries without giving this error.

Assuming it's linked to the similar stored procedure problem, there's some discussion [here](http://www.nabble.com/zend-db-and-stored-procedures-with-pdo-mysql-td13699414.html#a13699414) that it's specific to FreeBSD; I'm certainly running FreeBSD but haven't tested it elsewhere.

I've got absolutely the same bug on my home machine: Windows Vista HP, mysql 5.0.45, php 2.5.4 (and 2.5.5 in cgi mode fails too), so It's not because of FreeBSD. Must be something wrong with PDO, but i couldn't find an answer.
