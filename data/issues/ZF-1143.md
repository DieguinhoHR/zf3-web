### Description

There is a trivial comment error in library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Pgsql.php which refers to MySQL rather than PostgreSQL. I'd have just fixed it, but I don't have the karma :) It's one of those bugs that doesn't really matter but grated ever so slightly with me!

Patch is:

Index: Pgsql.php
================

--- Pgsql.php (revision 4239) +++ Pgsql.php (working copy) @@ -30,7 +30,7 @@ require\_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Exception.php';

/\*\* - \* Class for connecting to MySQL databases and performing common operations. + \* Class for connecting to PostgreSQL databases and performing common operations. \* \* @category Zend \* @package Zend\_Db
