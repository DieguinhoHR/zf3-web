### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket throws a notice for $this->config['sslusecontext'] on line 205.

config['sslusecontext'] is set in Http/Client/Adapter/Proxy.php to true, only if the secure flag is passed to connect(). It should be set to false, if the flag is not passed, so that no notice is thrown.

Dupe, should be fixed in SVN and will be fixed when 10.1.2 is released.
