ZF-6027: Fatal error on commit. Environment is as likely factor.

### Description

The maximum execution time is reached, causing a fatal error. Possibly due to recursion or an endless loop.

If I set the maximum execution time to something high enough php crashes before the limit is reached. Tried with 1.7.7 which was released about an hour ago.

A fair guess is that this is related to the environment that I'm running. Thus I'd be happy to know if there is any more details on the environment that I can provide. Furthermore it would be interesting to hear if anyone on OS X have come across this. If it can help I might be wiling to provide access to my computer.

Environment: MBP Core Duo OS X 10.5.6 PHP 5.2.6

Code:
-----

require '../library/Zend/Search/Lucene.php';

$indexDirectory = '../data/indicies/books';

try {

 
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open($indexDirectory);


} catch(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception $e) {

 
    if ($e->getMessage() != 'Index doesn\'t exists in the specified directory.') {
        throw $e;
    }
    
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::create($indexDirectory);


}

$doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document();

$doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Text('url', '<http://google.com>')); $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::UnStored('contents', 'happy content')); $index->addDocument($doc);

echo "pre commit";

$index->commit();

echo "post commit";
