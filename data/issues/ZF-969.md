### Description

After migrating from version 0.7 of the framework to version 0.8, route matching outside the default route is no longer working. I consulted with the manual (chapter 7.4.3.7: Default routes), and I can detect no changes from what I have been using. Either the manual is not up to date or this is a bug in the Controller.

Specifically, I use the following to set up my controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // setup controller
    
    $router = new Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite();
    
    //Base URL var
    $base_url = substr($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], 0, -9);
    
    //Paths to controllers
    $controller_paths = array('default' => './application/controllers','module' => './application/controllers/module');
    
    $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $controller->setControllerDirectory($controller_paths)
               ->setRouter($router)
               ->setBaseUrl($base_url)
               ->throwExceptions(true);
              
    // dispatch controller
    $controller->dispatch();


I get the following uncaught expection when trying to reach a controller using the route I created:

/module/todo/ ->

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Exception' with message 'File "Module\TodoController.php" was not found.
     in C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend.php:175 Stack trace: 
    #0 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend.php(103): Zend::loadFile('TodoController....', Array, true) 
    #1 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\index.php(15): Zend::loadClass('Module_TodoCont...') 
    #2 [internal function]: __autoload('Module_TodoCont...') 
    #3 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend\Controller\Dispatcher\Standard.php(241): class_exists('Module_TodoCont...') 
    #4 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend\Controller\Dispatcher\Standard.php(190): Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard->loadClass('TodoController') 
    #5 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend\Controller\Front.php(750): 
    Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard->dispatch(Object(Zend_Controller_Request_Http), Object(Zend_Controller_Response_Http)) 
    #6 C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\index.php(65): Zend_Controller_Front->dispatch() 
    #7 {main} thrown in C:\Server\htdocs\Octabox\library\Zend.php on line 175


Despite the controller being there. Controllers only seem to be found now if I put them in the main route's directory.

Assigning to Matthew.

Works for me.

Couple things to check:

- it won't work if your base url is set incorrectly (I know it's probably ok but double check it please)
- make sure your module controller class is named Module\_IndexController
- make sure your module directory is correctly configured (case sensitivity)

Changing the names of the controllers to Module\_{controller name}Controller indeed made it work. Thank you for that. You should consider revising the manual on this section, as there is no mention of it requiring this naming scheme in order to work (and it didn't in the previous release so it's a little surprising).

Thanks again
