ZF-7811: Wildcard data (captured by \*) is not translated in routes
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-09T08:14:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:39.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Localization of urls work perfectly, except for wildcard parameters. For example, if we define the following route :

bq. @contents/@pages/:@action/\*

We can handle urls like this in English:

bq. <http://domain.com/contents/pages/list/>

And the corresponding urls in French:

bq. <http://domain.com/contenus/pages/lister/>

But considering now parameters (key-value pairs) defined by the '\*' in the route, we could have in English:

bq. [http://domain.com/contenus/pages/…](http://domain.com/contenus/pages/lister/sortby/date/status/not-published)

However, the following (the same parameters in French) will not work:

bq. [http://domain.com/contenus/pages/…](http://domain.com/contenus/pages/lister/trierpar/date/statut/non-publie)

So parameters defined by the '\*' are never translated, whereas they should (and can) be. You will find attached to this issue a patch of the Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route class to make this work (it modifies the match() and assemble() methods).

Note this patch leveraged the patch proposed in the issue ZF-6654.
