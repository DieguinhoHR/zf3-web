### Description

This is a very subtle bug ; these 2 components will not work the same because of the dojo validators used.

To reproduice :

Create a form with 2 elements :

 
        // EMAIL         
        $this->addElement(
                'ValidationTextBox', 
                'email', 
                array(
                    'value'      => '',
                    'label'      => 'Email address : ',
                    'trim'       => true,
                    'lowercase'  => true,
                    'required'   => true,
                    'regExp'         => '^.{4,}$',
                    'invalidMessage' => 'Please insert your email address',
                    'validators' => array(
                                            array('EmailAddress', Zend_Validate_Hostname::ALLOW_DNS, true),
                                            array('StringLength', false, 4)
                                          ),
                    'filters'    => array('StringToLower'),
                    'style'     => 'background-image:none ; margin-bottom:20px; ',
                )
            );


and ...

 
        // LASTNAME
        $this->addElement(
                'TextBox', 
                'lastname', 
                array(
                    'value'      => '',
                    'label'      => 'Last name',
                    'trim'       => true,
                    'propercase' => true,
                    'style'     => 'background-image:none; margin-bottom:10px;',
                )
            );


Now try to modify some properties of these elements in the main css file ; for ex I tried to modify the legend and add border: 1px solid #ccc; This works only on one of the 2 elements, not on the other. And when you swich off Javascript, the css works fine.

I suspect this is because the dojo components might be created dynamically.

Dojo's dijits do not respect all of the inline styling of the original elements they apply to, and instead override them with the currently applied dijit theme. At best, this should be brought up with dojo as an issue.

The recommended method from dojo is to apply any customisation through your own stylesheets, or inline stylesheet, and from there you should be able to target specific elements by their ID.

I am closing this as it is an upstream related problem, and not fixable from within ZF itself.
