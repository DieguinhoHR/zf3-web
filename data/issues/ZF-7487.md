ZF-7487: Get "Territory Key" for Country
----------------------------------------

### Description

Last i tried to get some translations for country names, e.g. translate Österreich to Austria. With Zend\_Locale all i can do is to use Zend\_Locale::getTranslation("AT", "territory", "en-US") but at this point i don't know the AT "Key". To get the key i have to do

$key = array\_search("Österreich", Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList("territory", "de-AT"));

So it would be nice to have something like

Zend\_Locale::getTranslation("Österreich", "territoryKey", "de-AT"); Zend\_Locale::getTranslation("Austria", "territoryKey", "en");
