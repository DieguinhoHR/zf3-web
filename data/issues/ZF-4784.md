ZF-4784: Missing require results in fatal error

### Description

In a project I work on currently using the release-1.6.0 branch I hit a problem. Due to a conflict after an svn up in my config file, I ran into:

Fatal error: Class 'Zend\_Config\_Exception' not found in /projectdir/library/Zend/Config/Ini.php on line 113

Checking the code I found:

 
        if ($this->_loadFileErrorStr !== null) {
            throw new Zend_Config_Exception($this->_loadFileErrorStr);
        }


In this if statement, the exception being thrown is not yet included. Earlier in the same constructor method in another if statement, the Exception is being required before being used.

My fix for this was easy: add the require statement before throwing the error.

Actually, this has been fixed on both current trunk and the 1.6 release branch for two months (see r11208 and r11209, both dated 3 Sept 2008).
