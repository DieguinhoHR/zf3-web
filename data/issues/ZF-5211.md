### Description

Try leaving a Zend\_Form\_Element\_File with no file value specified (obviously set to not required)

After form validation: - receive() method will return true even if no file was specified, should fail gracefully. - getValue() will return the leaf directory, should return nothing (empty). - getFileName() method will return the directory specified with setDestination, should return nothing (empty).

As it is now, i cannot verify if the user actually left the field empty, because everything tells me that something was set.

When you set an element as optional, of course receive must return true, because it's not required. This is expected behaviour. Receive does only return false in case of a failure. But you defined that it's ok when no file is given, so true is returned.

getValue returns null when no file is given... please update to the latest release. Or use the isUploaded method to check if a file has been uploaded.

getFileName returns null when no file has been uploaded... please use the latest release.

You can verify if the user has not uploaded a file by: \* Using the isUploaded method \* By setting the element to required... isValid will then fail \* By calling getFileName and it's null \* By calling getFileInfo and the name key is empty and isUploaded is false

As you see there are several ways to get the related information.
