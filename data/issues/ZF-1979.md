ZF-1979: Need separate u/p for Gapps for system tests
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

Gapps online tests currently use the same clientlogin username/password as the other service tests. This makes it nearly impossible to run all tests for GData at the same time.

We should use different constant values for the Gapps username/password.

Fixed in SVN rev 6468

Looking at the changes in r6448, I can't help but wonder if it would be better to move this out of the main GDATA\_CLIENTLOGIN\_ENABLED block in AllTests.php.

Since the GApps online tests now have their own username/password, they could be run independently of the rest of the GData tests. The test configuration file should probably reflect this.

Agreed - do you want to throw a patch into trunk? :)
