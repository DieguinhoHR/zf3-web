### Description

Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::\_makeRequest() does not reset the 'Content-Encoding' header. This creates a problem when content with gzip content-encoding is uploaded to S3, then subsequent, non compressed, data is uploaded. I have included a patch below to address the issue.

Patch applied. In the future, please create your diff file from the top-level ZF directory (the one that contains library, tests, documentation, etc), and/or specify the file that needs to be patched. Also, please include unit tests in the future.

Hi Matthew,

I'll make sure to do that for any subsequent bugs.

Thanks, Nick
