### Description

A number of ZF components, including Zend\_Loader and Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Loader\_IncludePathLoader, are not tolerant of the new PHP 5.3 phar:// paths.

Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Loader\_IncludePathLoader::\_getFiles() example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $paths = explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, get_include_path());


An include path of '<a>phar://foo/bar.phar:.:/usr/lib/php</a>' will result in $paths looking like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Array
    (
        [0] => phar
        [1] => //foo/bar.phar
        [2] => .
        [3] => /usr/lib/php
    )


For ZF to support environments where phars are used in the include path, we may no longer explode on PATH\_SEPARATOR. Instead, we now need to step through the include\_path string more carefully, like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    // step through inc path, beware of phar://
    $incpath = get_include_path();
    $paths = array();
    $offset = 0;
    while ($pos = strpos($incpath, ':', $offset)) {
        $chunk = substr($incpath, 0, $pos);
        if ($chunk == 'phar') {
            ++$offset;
            continue;
        }
        $offset = 0;
        $paths[] = $chunk;
        $incpath = substr($incpath, $pos+1);
    }
    
    // catch the last one which no longer has 
    // a PATH_SEPARATOR in it
    if (! empty($incpath)) {
        $paths[] = $incpath;
    }
    unset($incpath, $offset, $chunk);


That results in $paths looking like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Array
    (
        [0] => <a>phar://foo/bar.phar</a>
        [1] => .
        [2] => /usr/lib/php
    )

Updated suggested fix to populate $incpath variable.

Clay -- I'd be thrilled if you would provide a patch and/or commit a fix. :) Be my guest. :)

I think this method should go onto Zend\_Loader, plus it can be hugely simplified, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strpos($path, "phar://") !== false) {
        $path = str_replace("phar://", "phar#//", $path);
        $paths = explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $path);
        foreach ($paths AS $k => $v) {
            $paths[$k] = str_replace("phar#//", "phar://", $paths[$k]);
        }
    }

Actually, searching for phar:// is a bit short-sighted; we really should honor all stream definitions in the path as well.

Assuming there are no directories ending on :// you could probably use the same patch?

 
    <pre class="highlight">if (strpos($path, '://') !== false) {
        $path = str_replace('://', "#//", $path);
        $paths = explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $path);
        foreach ($paths AS $k => $v) {
            $paths[$k] = str_replace('#//', '://', $paths[$k]);
        }
    }

(code untested, spur of mind)

The behavior was not just phar related, but affected any stream scheme registered in the include\_path.

I believe this is now working in trunk and the 1.10 release branch as of r20904; please test.
