### Description

For Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo::setFetchMode multiple arguments could be required, when working with PDO::FETCH\_CLASS for example. The current implementation does not support this feature since only the fetchmode can be set.

h3. Te reproduce

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class FooClass {} 
    
    $stmt = $db->query ( 'SELECT * FROM foo' );
    $stmt->setFetchMode ( PDO::FETCH_CLASS, 'FooClass' );


Which results in: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: No fetch class specified in ...

h3. Suggested fix

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setFetchMode($mode)
    {
         $args = func_get_args ();  
    
         $this->_fetchMode = $mode;
    
         try {
              return call_user_func_array ( array ( $this->_stmt, 'setFetchMode' ), $args );
         } catch (PDOException $e) {
              require_once 'Zend/Db/Statement/Exception.php';
              throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Exception($e->getMessage());
         }
    }

Instead of adding PDO specific features to the Statement general API, we have decided to add a method called getDriverStatement() which will be able to return the internal statement handler.

In the case of PDO, it will return PDOStatement, and you'll be able to call setFetchMode() on that object:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $stmt->getDriverStatement()->setFetchMode(....); // PDO specific method.


This helps keep the API consistent across all adapters/drivers.

This won't work. Zend\_Db\_Select has method query. This method accepts parameter $fetchMode, which if not given is initialized to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract->getFetchMode(). Later, setFetchMode is called with this parameter. Point is, if we use PDO, which REQUIRES 2 or 3 arguments to setFetchMode, this will break no matter what fetch mode is set beforehand.

Sorry, previous comment was not specific enough. PDO with FETCH\_CLASS requires 2 or 3 arguments to setFetchMode. Still, PDO and $fetchMode==FETCH\_CLASS will break, no matter if fetchMode was added with getDriverStatement or not.
