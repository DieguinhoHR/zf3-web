ZF-8157: Improve error reporting in the event of assertResponseCode() failure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-10-27T04:53:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:05.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

If assertResponseCode() does not get the response code it was expecting, is reports that the test failed, but not what the actual response code was. It would be helpful if this were changed so that the (erroneous) response code were reported. i.e. "Expected response 200, got response 500."

A similar problem applies to assertController() and assertAction().
