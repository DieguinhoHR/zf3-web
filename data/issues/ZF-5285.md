ZF-5285: ZendMail\_Storage Should provide factory() method
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-12-16T14:07:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:41.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Storage should provide a factory method for Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Abstract types. Since each Zend\_Mail\_Storage sub class has it's own required parameters for connecting to the given inbox type, the factory method should also validate require parameters for each protocol (or, perhaps, allow child classes to throw an exception).

This would be highly useful when developing applications which may use a different protocol in different environments. For example, my current project the code will read from a sample mbox file when running on developer machines, but will load messages from an IMAP account when on production. We have shipped our own factory method.

I will see if I can submit a patch as well.
