ZF-4489: Zend\_Gdata\_App::post()/put()/delete() don't document $remainingRedirects param

### Description

The post()/put()/delete() methods in Zend\_Gdata\_App don't document the meaning of their $remainingRedirects parameter.

Instead, they seem to document the non-existent $headers parameter (not to be confused with $extraHeaders).
