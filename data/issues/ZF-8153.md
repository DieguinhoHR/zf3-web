According to the API documentation, the 'MaxNumberOfMesssages' is correct: [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueSe…](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/2009-02-01/APIReference/index.html?Query_QueryReceiveMessage.html)

Where did you see/read/.. that it should be 'NumberOfMessages' instead?

Maghiel,

You were right to close this issue; however, it looks like the submitter was reading old documentation. See the following link for changes made to the API:
