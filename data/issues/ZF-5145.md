ZF-5145: Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count default messages are not using correct english for error messages

### Description

The message temples and error constants for errors given in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count are as follows: protected $\_messageTemplates = array( self::TOO\_MUCH => "Too much files, maximum '%max%' are allowed but '%count%' are given", self::TOO\_LESS => "Too less files, minimum '%min%' are expected but '%count%' are given" ); const TOO\_MUCH = 'fileCountTooMuch'; const TOO\_LESS = 'fileCountTooLess';

I would propose they be changed to protected $\_messageTemplates = array( self::TOO\_MANY => "Too many files, maximum '%max%' are allowed but '%count%' are given", self::TOO\_FEW => "Too few files, minimum '%min%' are expected but '%count%' are given" ); const TOO\_MANY = 'fileCountTooHigh'; const TOO\_FEW = 'fileCountTooLow';

The constants could possibly be named different, like fileTooManyFiles and fileTooFewFiles or something like that.

This is a BC break and can not be done without breaking all existing applications.

Constant changes are not allowed.

But you can already change any given default message with your own message and even translation.

Seems like a nice issue for 2.0?

Edit: I don't seem to be able to set this issue to 'postponed'?
