ZF-6301: Allow user-provided adapters

### Description

Zend\_Translate actually loads adapters only from Zend/Translate/Adapter/\* location, but it would be nice if a developer could add a path to his own adapters, which would be located in My/Translate/Adapter/\*.

With user-provided adapters, developer could add an own database-translation adapter and use it with Zend\_Translate. I have made a small expirement where my adapter (located in Zend/Translate/Adapter/) uses my database model and Zend\_Translate automatically caches the result with Zend\_Cache.

The "problem" is located in Zend/Translate.php at the setAdapter() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setAdapter($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array())
    {
        if (Zend_Loader::isReadable('Zend/Translate/Adapter/' . ucfirst($adapter). '.php')) {
            $adapter = 'Zend_Translate_Adapter_' . ucfirst($adapter);
        }
        ...
    }

Zend\_Translate is only a "factory" like class to instantiate translate adapters. Why aren't you instantiating your class directly?

```

It isn't the finest way but it should help.

This is a possible way, I haven't checked this solution and I just thought about a more flexible factory pattern implementation, maybe similar to the new Zend\_Application component where you can add more plugin paths.

This is just a small idea from my side :)

Sorry, but I don't see a problem with this code... You can use ANY properitary adapter by simply giving it:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $translate = new Zend_Translate('My_Own_Properitary_Translation_Adapter', $file, $locale, $options);


It is even written within the manual within a own chapter how to do this: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.adapter.html#zend.translate.adapter.selfwritten)

Sorry, seems to be my fault. When I did the tests, I had not seen this chapter in the manual!

I will try this and will report, if it worked for me or not. Thanks for the hint to the manual, it seems I'll have to re-read some hcapters ;)

Closing as non-issue
