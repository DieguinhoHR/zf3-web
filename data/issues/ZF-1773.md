### Description

A new options should be added for all adapters where the language can be determinated.

"scanDirectory"... should scan and add all source files within the given directory. Adapters like "TMX" can integrate it automatically.

Other adapters like "Gettext" or "CSV" have to be named with a defined schema to be automatically recognised.

Eigther the file is named "locale".mo.... or the file is named like Myfile."locale".mo... or the file is named like Myfile\_"locale".mo... or the file is named like Myfile-"locale".mo

split multi-file-based translations into different directories should also be able. A quick&dirty-workaround by me you can see below, if youre interested in. This based on a structure, where the files where place in /"locale"/myfile.mo. I think a swap beetween file- and directoryname like /mydir/"locale".mo should not very difficult. Im thinking about an extension of Zend\_Translate to realise this feature internaly by my Translate-Class without setting it up external.

 
    <pre class="highlight">        $loc = new Zend_Locale();
            $languageDir = new DirectoryIterator($directory);
            $translate = null;
            foreach ($languageDir as $entry) {
                //Zend_Debug::dump ($entry->getFilename());
                if ($entry->isDot() || $entry->isFile()) {
                    continue;
                }
                if ($loc->isLocale($entry->getFilename())) {
                    $localeDir = new DirectoryIterator(realpath($entry->getPathname()));
                    foreach ($localeDir as $localeEntry) {
                        if ($localeEntry->isDot() || $localeEntry->isDir()) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        if ($localeEntry->getFilename() === 'myfile.mo') {
                            if ($translate === null) {
                                $translate = new Zend_Translate ('gettext', $localeEntry->getPathname(),$entry->getFilename());
                            } else {
                                $translate->addTranslation ($localeEntry->getPathname(),$entry->getFilename());
                            }
                        }
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }

Multi Directory Support is part of ZF-1774 not ZF-1773...

The needs are quite different as not all are using gettext as adapter. For CSV you would probably use directory only support.
