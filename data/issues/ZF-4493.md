### Description

Hi dev,

in manual is write: {quote} When this flag is set, the dispatcher will use the default controller and **action** instead of throwing an exception. The disadvantage to this method is that any typos a user makes when accessing your site will still resolve and display your home page, which can wreak havoc with search engine optimization. {quote}

And: {quote} useDefaultControllerAlways is used to hint to the dispatcher to use the default controller in the default module for any request that is not dispatchable (i.e., the module, controller, and/or **action** do not exist). {quote}

But when I have set up useDefaultControllerAlways in Front Controller and I write in URI action which doesn't exists, then the exception will be throwed. And when reqeust object containt controller and action which don't exists then the exception will be throwed too.

useDefaultControllerAlways set up to true works only when request object contain controller which doesn't exists, then will be dispatched default controller and default action.
