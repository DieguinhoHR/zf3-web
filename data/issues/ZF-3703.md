ZF-3703: Allow Zend\_Db\_Adapters to changeSchema() (switch database)

### Description

Actually, when you set a 'dbname' => parameter to your adapter's config array, you cannot change it anymore after. It could be usefull to abstract the schema changing of a connection. A changeSchema() method should be then created in the abstract class and then redefined in all the concrete adapter classes. For Mysql, the use of "USE" command can take care of that.

There is no activity on this issue and I really don't see this as a must have feature since we can create multiple adapters (with or without multidb resource).

Can we mark this as "not an issue"?
