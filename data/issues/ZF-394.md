### Description

Rev. 1104 ``` Result is 425.

Normally a localized value can only be a string, but I think, if someone passes a float type value (or maybe more generally: any scalar type that's not a string) to Zend\_Locale\_Format::getNumber() it should skip the normalization process, as a float is already and guaranteed a normalized value.

Another Idea: Should Zend\_Locale\_Format::getNumber() decline an array as $input or should it iterate (recursively) over the array and return an array of results?

The result is right... '.' is grouping in german.

I thought when a person wants to normalize a value instead of a string he has to know that the returned result is wrong.

I changed this and added a check. (within the next SVN release) But to mention: Every check reduces the speed of execution.

To array: We could integrate this... But do we realy need this ??

And another problem: Now when no number was found an exception will be thrown... How to handle no found number within the array ? 0 is wrong, empty could also lead to misbehaviour.

The exception problem is a good point. Now I think the array-feature shouldn't be implemented. If a user needs this a foreach is easily written ...

Numbers are now returned without normalization beginning with SVN 1113.
