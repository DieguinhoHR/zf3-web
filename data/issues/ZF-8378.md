### Description

25,00 € is incorrect, the correct way to display euro sign is before the amount, as in: € 25,00. See also the Wikipedia page: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro\_sign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_sign) This is for the locales nl\_BE, fr\_BE and others. There are however a few exceptions.

Please give an reproducable example. Running this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $currency = new Zend_Currency('nl_NL');
    var_dump($currency->toCurrency(200));


I got the following output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string '€ 200,00' (length=11)


This is expected and correct behaviour.

It is locale nl\_BE not nl\_NL

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $currency = new Zend_Currency('nl_BE');
    //or
    $currency = new Zend_Currency('fr_BE');
    var_dump($currency->toCurrency(200));


I got the following output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string '200,00 €' (length=11)

Then please add an issue to Unicode. (<http://www.unicode.org/cldr>) Zend Framework uses the same localization database as many many other languages (Java, Python, C++,...)

And Unicode defines the currency syntax for nl\_BE as "#,##0.00 ¤"

This results to an output like "1,000.00 €" and is correct according to the latest CLDR.

Still, when you think that Unicode is wrong for your case, you could simply change this with some options yourself.

Closing as non-issue Formatting is correct according to Unicode
