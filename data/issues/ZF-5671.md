### Description

I extend this class, and when I want to use $this->\_cols, it is empty. But, when it is called after $this->select(), its working correctly.

Is it a feature and I missed someting in the documentation or it is a bug? Previous versions have this issue? too.

Thank You.

There is a lazy loading of metadata. Before calling, $this->\_cols you need to populate by $this->\_setupMetadata().

The better way is to call $this->info(self::COLS) that does it for you.

There's also \_getCols() method int Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract which do this for you.
