ZF2-223: 404s ActionController::notFound should not modify the route match
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Raising a 404 in a controller by calling notFound causes the view layer to look for the wrong template.

It shouldn't modify the routematch. Per weirophinney:

"We need to alter this to not modify the route match; it's a bad practice stemming from the hack we used for view rendering prior to introducing the new view layer. "
