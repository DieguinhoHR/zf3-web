ZF-4741: Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Rating should have a value property
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-10-29T12:52:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

gd:rating has a value attribute. accessors should be added to Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Rating for this attribute.

- - - - - -

Why is the value field in gd:rating so complicated to work with?

From the YouTube PHP guide:

// create a custom attribute for gd:rating value $rating->setExtensionAttributes(array(array('namespaceUri' => '<http://schemas.google.com/g/2005>', 'name' => 'value', 'value' => $ratingValue)));

Why not setValue() and getValue() (like getAverage() and setAverage())
