### Description

I have noticed that Zend\_Locale throws an exception with the message "Autodetection of Locale has been failed!" when used with Zend\_Rest\_Server and Zend\_Rest\_Client.

Here is my setup...

Server A - Zend\_Rest\_Server instance. - Exception thrown when using $date = new Zend\_Date(); within a rest controller.

Server B - Zend\_Rest\_Client initiates request to Server A.

I have also noticed this problem with visitors to my site. It is infrequent but a real bug that is causing some browsers to die when the exception is thrown.
