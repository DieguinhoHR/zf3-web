### Description

For some reason Zend\_Db\_Select tries to be clever and set the limit to PHP\_INT\_MAX if only offset is supplied. This, for one, means you can't offset into a table with more than 2^31 rows, but also causes strange differences compared to using the freetds driver on linux. This is because it actually tries to add the $offset onto the $count, even though $count is already at int max!

Basically, in the SQLsrv adapter, line 633 or so, this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
                $end = $offset + $count;
    
                $sql = "WITH outer_tbl AS ($sql) SELECT * FROM outer_tbl WHERE \"ZEND_DB_ROWNUM\" BETWEEN $start AND $end";


Needs to be changed to:

 
    <pre class="literal">
                if ($count == PHP_INT_MAX) {
                    $sql = "WITH outer_tbl AS ($sql) SELECT * FROM outer_tbl WHERE \"ZEND_DB_ROWNUM\" >= $start";
                }
                else {
                    $end = $offset + $count;
    
                    $sql = "WITH outer_tbl AS ($sql) SELECT * FROM outer_tbl WHERE \"ZEND_DB_ROWNUM\" BETWEEN $start AND $end";
                }

Seems similar

Does this solve itself with a 64-bit version of PHP?
