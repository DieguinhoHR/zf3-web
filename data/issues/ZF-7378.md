### Description

Please note that this ticket is for ZF2.0. We should pass up the chance to change default settings, as a new major release allows us to break BC ;-) Pleas see ZF-4838 for farther details.

It is of course arguable whether this is the right thing to do. I don't really know - however keep in mind that PHP's default behavior (of SSL streams) is _not_ to verify such things.

Then again, we can discuss this when the time comes :)

Let me re-post some older comments:

> Unfortunately switching validation on per default is not an option as it would break currently working applications. I would suggest to change this with ZF 2.0 - as other libs / languages I know (CURL, Java, C# etc) are doing so out of the box. And in my believes this is the only correct way of using HTTPS. If someone wants to do insecure things he is free to do so, but he has to explicitly switch checks off.

(see [http://nabble.com/Validating-SSL-server-certs---usâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Validating-SSL-server-certs---using-CA-certs-p20225319.html) for full post)

> I don't know which Zend\_Service\_Whatever-Classes are based on HTTPS (a quick grep showed Amazon\_Ec2, Delicious, ReCaptcha), probably all of them are using Zend\_Http\_Client - with insecure defaults. And I'm pretty sure others will follow.
> 
> Therefore I strongly suggest changing default settings with ZF 2.0. Many developers just don't realize that self-signed certificates lead HTTPS ad absurdum - and also not verifying signed ones does. If someone insists on using useless certificates he can do so. But he needs to be made aware of doing something REALLY bad (and shall be forced into explicitely allowing this in his own code).

I do NOT think it is arguable what the default setting should look like. Other languages / frameworks behave correct, even cURL (also in PHP) does so. And I don't think taking PHP's scary defaults as a reference would be a good idea.
