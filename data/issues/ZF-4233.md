### Description

PaginationControl does not currently support modules, although Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial does. Change the method call to support this by making the $partial parameter accept either a string or an array composed of a module and a partial.

The Documentation should be updated accordingly. Currently the API doc states that the view partial has to be a string.
