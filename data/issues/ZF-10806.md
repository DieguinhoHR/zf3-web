### Description

ContextSwitch (action helper) does not disable the layout when i use the json context. AjaxContext(action helper) behaves exactly the same.

Code example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    class AdminController extends Zend_Controller_Action{
       //...
        public function init(){
            
            $ajaxContext = $this->_helper->getHelper('AjaxContext');
            $ajaxContext
                ->addActionContext('create-mailing-project', 'json')
            ->addActionContext('delete-mailing-project', 'json')
            ->addActionContext('send-mailing-project', 'json')
            ->initContext()
            ;
                    
        }
        //...
    
        /* call this action as /admin/create-mailing-project/format/json */
        public function createMailingProjectAction(){
        
        //I disable layout manually here!!! (((
        $this->_helper->layout->disableLayout();
        
        //some code...
        
        //$new_mailing_project - some array
        $this->view->new_mailing_project = $new_mailing_project;
                
        }
    }

Can you provide code samples on how you're using the helper? Trying to reproduce will be nothing but guesswork for us, otherwise.

Did you mean ContextSwitch and AjaxContext as action helpers, not view helpers?

Code examples above. I certainly had in mind action helpers, sorry). Sorry for my bad english too.

Hello,

I also have trouble with this. I created a controller plugin:

public function preDispatch(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract $request) { $ajaxContextSwitch = Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('AjaxContext'); $ajaxContextSwitch->setDefaultContext('json'); $ajaxContextSwitch->addActionContext('output','json'); $ajaxContextSwitch->initContext(); }

But even though i get an error that my view script cannot be found.

This is the url i use:

'/user/save-adres/format=json'

Hi,

I encountered a similar problem today and my solution/my fault was that the action names are not normalized and therefore case-sensitive.

I called [http://XXX/Auth/Login-Mobile/â€¦](http://XXX/Auth/Login-Mobile/format/json/?format=json) (Double parameter format to be sure that the format is found by the ContextSwitch Helper). ``` did. If I call .../login-mobile/... the first ActionContext worked but the second didn't.

As a result I would recommend to normalize the ActionContext names to prevent this phenomenon like the action method names or the view script path names.
