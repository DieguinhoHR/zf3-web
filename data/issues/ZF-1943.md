### Description

I'm unsure whether this is a known issue, but I received the following failure running the Zend\_Db unit tests with PHP 5.1.4 (CLI) and PHPUnit 3.1.0beta4 on WinXP (SVN r6334):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    testStatementGetColumnMeta(Zend_Db_Statement_Pdo_MysqlTest)
    Failed asserting that two arrays are equal.

Oh, and my mysql server version is 5.0.21.

Interesting. That test passes on PHP 5.2.4, so I activated my instance of PHP 5.1.6 and tried the test.

Indeed, the 'table' key in the data returned by getColumnMeta() is not there in the older version of PDO.

Resolved by [~bkarwin] for 1.1.0 with [SVN r6346](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/~author=bkarwin/Zend_Framework/?cs=6346) and for 1.0.2 with [SVN r6347](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/~author=bkarwin/Zend_Framework/?cs=6347).
