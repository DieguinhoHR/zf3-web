### Description

When I try to create a dbtable using zf (command: zf create dbtable ) I get an Exception with the following message bq. _A models directory was not found_

Line 63 in Zend\\Tool\\Project\\Provider\\DbTable reads bq. _if (!($modelsDirectory instanceof ProjectProfile\\Resource)) {_

I guess it should be bq. _if (!($modelsDirectory instanceof \\Zend\\Tool\\Project\\Profile\\Resource\\Resource)) {_

I can confirm this on 2.0.0dev4 as well. The model dir does indeed exist as was created by the initial "zf create project".

Replacing ProjectProfile\\Resource with \\Zend\\Tool\\Project\\Profile\\Resource\\Resource in Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/DbTable.php, as Mr. Erdem says, fixes this.

Zend\\Tool does not work with ZF2 and will be removed. You can clone the [ZendSkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication) to get a base working ZF2 project.

Closing as "Wont' Fix" (See [Matthew's comment on ZF2-103 here](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-103?focusedCommentId=49688&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-49688))
