### Description

This is a feature request that the Zend\_Db\_Adapter class should support an interface to allow one to specify a custom class for the Profiler object. Currently the Adapter is hardcoded to create an instance of 'Zend\_Db\_Profiler' and there is no way to specify the class, or pass an object instance, or set the Adapter's profiler.

Currently the Adapter configuration options supports a key 'profiler' which if true means to enable the profiler upon creation of the Adapter.

Removed proposed interface design from the issue description. The implementation differs from the suggested design.

Now the 'profiler' option is used for all specification of the profiler. \* Boolean value sets the profiler to enabled or disabled. \* String names a class to load for a custom profiler. \* Object instance of Zend\_Db\_Profiler may be used as-is. \* Array may contain keys 'enabled', 'class', or 'instance'. \* Zend\_Config object may contain properties 'enabled' or 'class'.

See documentation for examples of usage.
