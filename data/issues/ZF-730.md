I believe that this code has a logic error, since as long as the string length of $key is greater than $min, the function returns true, and the check on the maximum string length is never run. It's no big deal; this isn't a hard function to code, and the example serves well enough to explain what is meant - just an observation for those that might copy and paste.

I forgot to mention that this is just pseudocode... Sry ;-)

Zend\_Validate\_StringLength is now available to provide this functionality.
