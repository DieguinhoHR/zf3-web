The iframe is there in case the client does not support javascript. I'm not sure if there is another way to do it for browsers without javascript support. One possible solution would be to fetch the recaptcha server side and strip it of ,

 and so forth and then display it. Sounds a bit nasty but it would probably work.

This problem prevents rendering (BREAK!) when you use MIME application/xhtml+xml and XHTML1.1

Also, the &error part of the rendered code should be &error to be compilant

This is not a Zend Framework bug but the method used by the ReCaptcha service itself. As such, it cannot be fixed by the framework. ReCaptcha offers an AJAX API (to be implemented soon for ZF) which may allow more compliant changes. If this remains a concern, add a comment to any related issue on the ReCaptcha mailing list where this is discussed often enough.
