### Description

We have some strange behaviour with Zend\_Filter\_Alnum & Zend\_Filter\_Alpha since ZF 1.5. Everything works correct by using ZF 1.0.4.

By folowing code line echo Zend\_Filter\_Alnum::filter("Lüge"); // in utf-8 encoding delivers Lge instead of Lüge until ZF 1.0.x the result was correct.

Corresponding code block in Zend/Filter/Alnum.php:             if (!self::$_unicodeEnabled) {
                // POSIX named classes are not supported, use alternative
    a-zA-Z0-9 match
                $pattern = '/[^a-zA-Z0-9' . $whiteSpace . ']/';
            } else if (extension_loaded('mbstring')) {
                // Unicode safe filter for the value with mbstring
                $pattern = '/[^[:alnum:]'  . $whiteSpace . ']/u';
            } else {
                // Unicode safe filter for the value without mbstring
                $pattern = '/[^\p{L}\p{N}' . $whiteSpace . ']/u';
            }

The problem is we have the mbstring enabled and this line don't work  
 $pattern = '/[^[:alnum:]' . $whiteSpace . ']/u'; but this line $pattern = '/[^\\p{L}\\p{N}' . $whiteSpace . ']/u'; The internal-encoding is correctly set to UTF-8.

The question is why the [:alnum:] line don't work, and why it is useful to handle on another way if the extension is enabled ?

Hello, Dominik. Is the mbstring extension used in German ?

In the last version, before changing in ZF-2107, only "^\\p{L}\\p{N}" pattern is used.

But I found it causes error in Japanese. The problem is all character of Japanese is passed. So, I changed because I thought mbstring extension used only in the language that has many multibyte characters.

But if the mbstring extension used in German , (or Czeck, Polish...etc) ZF-2107 happens your problems.

Do you have any idea instead of using "if (extension\_loaded('mbstring'))" ? It seems to be better if we use language location in if statement.

Hello Satoru,

sorry for my late answer.

I don't think mbstring extension is used in German, it shouldn't. But the mbextension often is installed by default.

I think we should add a second condition to the if statement, maybe something that asks if the default zend\_locale is japanese.

Best regards Dominik

Hello, Dominik. Thank you for your reply.

Ok, I try to add some condition by using Zend\_Locale. :-)

I have same problem with russian characters:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$filter = new Zend_Filter_Alnum(true);  
    Zend_Debug::dump($filter->filter('это странненько - mbstring enabled'));  
    //string(19) "   mbstring enabled"

 
    <pre class="highlight">$filter = new Zend_Filter_Alnum(true);  
    Zend_Debug::dump($filter->filter('это странненько - mbstring disabled'));  
    //string(48) "это странненько  mbstring disabled"

In my case $pattern = '/[^[:alnum:]' . $whiteSpace . ']/u'; is used by filter.
