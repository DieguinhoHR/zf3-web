ZF-9553: Client Doesn't Remember That It Was Initialized

### Description

Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Abstract has an initialize method that is called inside the client's dispatch method. The initialize method only needs to be run once, and does a lot of resource intensive work, so the first thing it does is check if it's been initialized already

 
        //Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Abstract.php on line 104
        // if its already initialized, no need to initialize again
        if ($this->_isInitialized) {
            return;
        }


However it doesn't set \_isInitialized to true when the method is finished. This caused a problem for me when I started issuing console requests inside of the initial request, as memory usage skyrocketed due to the repetition inside this method.

This can be fixed by adding

 
    $this->_isInitialized = true;


at the end of the method.

Yes, this is problem for me too when I call dispatch in cycle. So I must extends my own class from abstract client to fix it. Not a nice solution, but it works.
