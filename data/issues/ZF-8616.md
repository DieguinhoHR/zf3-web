### Description

In JSON, the presence of invalid Unicode should produce an error. In the case of PHP's ext/json it instead returns NULL (presumably to avoid unnecessary errors). Zend\_Json\_Encoder, the PHP native implementation used either by choice or in the absence of ext/json does neither, instead pulling out what appears to be a codepoint reference. This gives rise to invalid JSON strings in that such refs are lost and presented as literal characters.

Reproduce with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">require_once 'Zend/Json/Encoder.php';
     
    $source = <<

Expected (as per ext/json):

NULL

Actual:

"ab\\u005c0022"
