### Description

When using authentication in an AMF request, Zend\_Amf\_Server fails to recognise the appropriate headers.

In Zend\_Amf\_Server on line 496 it starts to handle the Authentication. First, it gets the AMF headers, and then checks if there is a array key called 'Credentials' (Zend\_Amf\_Constants::CREDENTIALS\_HEADER). If there is, then it checks if there is a userid property:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $handleAuth = false;
    if ($this->_auth) {
        $headers = $request->getAmfHeaders();
        if (isset($headers[Zend_Amf_Constants::CREDENTIALS_HEADER]) &&
            isset($headers[Zend_Amf_Constants::CREDENTIALS_HEADER]->userid)) {
            $handleAuth = true;
        }
    }


But, there is no array key called Credentials, because all headers are simply pushed in the headers array (see Zend\_Amf\_Request line 121:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Iterate through the AMF envelope header
    while ($headerCount--) {
        $this->_headers[] = $this->readHeader();
    }


When outputting the headers ($request->getAmfHeaders(), line 498, Zend\_Amf\_Server) this is what you get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [0] => Zend_Amf_Value_MessageHeader Object
            (
                [name] => Credentials
                [mustRead] => 1
                [length] => 43
                [data] => stdClass Object
                    (
                        [userid] => *snip*
                        [password] => *snip*
                    )
    
            )
    )


But according to the code, it looks like it expects something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array (
        [Credentials] => Object
            (
               [userid] => *snip*
               [password] => *snip*
            )
    )


Proposed solution: Loop through the headers, and check if there is a Zend\_Amf\_Value\_MessageHeader which has a $name property that is called 'Credentials', and then check if the Zend\_Amf\_Value\_MessageHeader $data property has as $userid property.

The problem is in version 1.10.0 but I also checked the latest version (1.10.5), but it does not seem changed since 1.10.0.
