ZF-2854: Serialising Zend\_Db\_Select object leads to failure when unserializing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When a Zend\_Db\_Select object is serialised (eg. into a Session), on the next page load when Session\_Start occurs and objects are woken up, PHP throws a fatal error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'You cannot serialize or unserialize PDO instances' in /export/lib/Zend/Session.php:380
    Stack trace:
    #0 [internal function]: PDO->__wakeup()
    #1 /export/lib/Zend/Session.php(380): session_start()


This is because the attached Zend\_Db\_Adapter instance is not removed when the Zend\_Db\_Select object is serialised. (Why it doesn't fail until it attempts to be unserialised, I do not know.)

Please categorize/fix as needed.

I think a similar system as Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract should be implemented to allow Zend\_Db\_Select to be serialized (sessioned), with \_\_sleep(). The object should get reconnected just after unserializing, like Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rows do.

What dou you think about that ?

No action on this issue for too long. I'm reassigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.
