ZF-573: [Incubator] Check controller directories in reverse?
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher::addControllerDirectory() checks directories in the order that they were added. On the other hand, Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter::route() matches routes in reverse. Cascading (checking in reverse) seems more correct to me for directory routes.

--- foreach ($directories as $directory) { +++ foreach (array\_reverse($directories) as $directory) {

I don't agree. I view addControllerDirectory() in a similar light as the include\_path, where precedence occurs left to right (i.e., FIFO); reversing the order seems counterintuitve.

Per comments in ticket, addControllerDirectory() should follow the same rules as include\_path.
