ZF-4124: Default to application-wide locale instead of browser locale in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter

### Description

Currently, when no locale is passed to Zend\_Translate\_Adapter->addTranslation(), $locale defaults to "new Zend\_Locale()".

I would rather expect it first to default to application-wide locale ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.html#zend.locale.frameworkwidelocale)), and if not set, then default to "new Zend\_Locale()".

In my web application, users can change language (through a $lang variable). When they change it, I define a system-wide locale (let's say to "fr") as defined in Zend\_Locale manual, storing my Zend\_Locale instance into Zend\_Registry::set('Zend\_Locale', $locale); Once I've set it, I would reasonably expect Zend\_Translate\_Adapter to default to this value (and display content in French as chosen by user) instead of having to specify each time what current locale is (generating "new Zend\_Locale()" instance without parameters default locale to user's browser locale, therefore if user has an English browser, but clicked to display content in French (which I stored in application-wide locale), I would expect Zend\_Translate\_Adapter to default to this locale (French) and not to user's browser locale (English).

Basically I would change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($locale === null) {
                $locale = new Zend_Locale();
            }


into

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($locale === null) {
                $locale = Zend_Registry::isRegistered('Zend_Locale') ? Zend_Registry::get('Zend_Locale') : new Zend_Locale();
            }


Feel free to contact me if unclear (or if you want me to stop spamming Zend\_Translate component :) )

Regards, Remy

Application wide locale is not supported for 1.5.3 and will not be in future. This feature will be added in 1.7 and is already available in trunk.

This is wether a bug, nor a feature.

Please write to the mailing list when you have problems with existing features and you are not sure if they are bugs or not.

it's 1.10.6 already and application wide locale is still not there. Docs declare I can set an application wide locale, so I started debugging to see what gone wrong, then switched to searching issues - waste of time. Please, implement that feature or at least add a comment to docs that its not implemented to Zend\_Translate yet.

Implementing something which is already implemented is useless. Use "null" when you don't want to have "browser" or "environment" or "auto".

Note that adding languages without knowing the language which should be added is also useless.
