ZF-12369: Limiting rows not working properly in Zend\_Db\_Select
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Limiting result set in Zend\_Db\_Select is not working when I pass zero as parameter to "limit" method.

For example $imagesTable->select()->limit(5) will return 5 rows, but $imagesTable->select()->limit(0) will return all rows, because the "LIMIT 0" is not included in the query.

i don't this this major bug. it will be like there is no parameter. and there is an internal check for limit greater than zero.
