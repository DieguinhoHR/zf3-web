The issue description indicates but does not demonstrate that the messages should be swapped. If isValid() is called with the inclusive option set to true, then the validation failure message returned is "'$value' is not between '$this->\_min' and '$this->\_max', inclusively", which is the correct message to return.

If this is still believed to be an issue, please reopen, demonstrating that the returned message is incorrect.

Oh, sorry. My fault. I was looking in the code at late night and didn't understand its logic. Sorry once again.
