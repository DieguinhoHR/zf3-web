### Description

Some of the public API methods in Zend\_Session\_Core are not documented, including recently added optional arguments involving closing or ending sessions.

Additionally, the docs for "strict" operation, the "single instance" style of usage, and bootstrap code need clarifications to avoid potentional confusion regarding usage, and where to use (i.e. in bootstrap only).
