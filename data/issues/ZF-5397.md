### Description

Not sure if this has been pointed out yet but when using Zend\_Paginator the View functionality is not supported on a default PHP installation unless you set the short\_open\_tag=On in the php.ini file.

From the php.ini file " Using short tags is discouraged when developing code meant for redistribution since short tags may not be supported on the target server."

Sorry if this has been fixed or pointed out already. Armando Padilla

Closing this issue as not an issue. The component itself uses full PHP tags. Only the example view scripts in the documentation use short tags.
