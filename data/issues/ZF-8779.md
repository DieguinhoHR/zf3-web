ZF-8779: Unexpected Results - Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps -> retrieveUser
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-01-11T12:14:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:28.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend\_GData\_GApps::retrieveUser method returns undocumented (and possibly erroneous behavior). If an empty string is provided as an argument, then the method returns the first user's object in the domain (aaappleseed). This can prove to be quite tricky and downright ugly when an account is unexpectedly modified.

(semi-pseudo code)

$g = new Zend\_GData\_Gapps; $u = $g->retrieveUser('BOGUSBOGUS');

_returns NULL_ (expected)

$g = new Zend\_GData\_Gapps; $u = $g->retrieveUser('jaappleseed');

_returns Johnny Appleseed's user object_ (expected)

$g = new Zend\_GData\_Gapps; $u = $g->retrieveUser('');

_returns first user in domain, alphabetically ex. "Amy A. Appleseed (aaappleseed)"_ (unexpected) _expected NULL_

Downgrading to minor, since there's an easy workaround for this: Just avoid passing an empty string as an argument.
