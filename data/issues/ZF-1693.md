### Description

If, for example we have:

 
    <pre class="literal">/**
     * My Function
     *
     * @return array
     */
    function myFunction() {
        if (something) {
            return array();
        }
        return false;
    }

Because we expected an array, but returned a boolean (it could also be true), the boolean should be taken to be the status of the request, false = failure, true = success. I think this is a common way to write code :)

stale issue, and no watchers.
