ZF-921: Refactor Gdata unit tests to skip live tests by default

### Description

The Google Gdata servers are occasionally unreliable about responding. The unit tests run for Zend\_Gdata get responses with status codes in the 500-599 range indicating this. This shows up as failures or errors in the unit test run, and it is confusing for people to see this.

Suggest refactoring Zend\_Gdata unit tests to do as many "static" tests as possible without touching the external servers. Enable "live" tests that contact Google servers only if a const in the TestConfiguration.php is set to true. Add comments around this const to explain that sporadic failures may be seen depending on availability and stability of Google servers.

I have separated the unit tests that contact Google Gdata servers and made them run only if the appropriate variable is defined TRUE in TestConfiguration.php.

Applies to revision 3804.
