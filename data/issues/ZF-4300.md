### Description

I like this class and would love for it to contain a getRaw() function that would just return the raw content used when creating the object. Typical usage: store it in a database, fetch it and build a Zend\_Mail\_Message

Hi, Kristian.

Do you mean that you need another methods from the magic methods like as \_\_get() and \_\_toString() ,or getContent() method in Zend\_Mail\_Part ?

I will be happy if you would tell me anything.

You don't want the whole parsing overhead if you just want to store the message as is in a DB. The storage class has two getRaw\*() methods for that purpose.

Thank You for Your comment, and I agree with you, Nico.

The getRawHeader() and getRawContent() methods in Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_\* classes could be useful for the repoter's purpose.

I can change this issue to won't fix, if good that I would do.
