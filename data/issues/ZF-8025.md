### Description

If your project is structured as follows (at least part of it):\\

 
    <pre class="literal">/application
        /modules
            /blog
                /models
                    /generated
                        BaseUser.php (Blog_Model_BaseUser)
                    User.php (Blog_Model_User)

... it's not possible to use a resource or module autoloader to load the base models in the /generated folder, because a resource type can only be associated with a single path.

It would work if you could specify multiple paths like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">'model' => array(
            'paths' => array('models/', 'models/generated/'),
            'namespace' => 'Blog_Model'
    )

Or, you could enable searching in subdirectries:

 
    <pre class="literal">'model' => array(
            'path' => 'models/',
            'includeSubdirectories' => true,
            'namespace' => 'Blog_Model'
    )

This would also be useful if, for example, you had your view helpers in subdirectories for organization purposes:

 
    <pre class="literal">/views
        /helpers
            /html
                MyFormElement.php (Foo_Helper_MyFormElement)
            /javascript
                MyJsHelper.php (Foo_Helper_MyJsHelper)

Again, same "namespace", different directories.
