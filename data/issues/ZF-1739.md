### Description

When I run this simple code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$mBio = new Litra_Model_Biography(); // extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    
    for ($i = 0; $i < 10000000; $i++) 
    {
      $mBio->insert(array('content' => time(), 'id_writer' => 1));
    }

after some numbers of iterations script dies with this fatal error: ??Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 16777216 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1464 bytes) in E:\\web\\lib\\zendframework\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Pdo\\Abstract.php on line 585??

Database type: PDO\_MYSQL MySQL version: 5.0.24a-community

By the way, inserting so much data in this manner is very inefficient. Most RDBMS brands have some special facility for bulk loading of large quantities of rows. MySQL has the LOAD DATA INFILE statement, which is about 20 times faster than using a loop of a large number of INSERT operations.

At the very least, you should wrap the loop in a single transaction so you don't incur overhead for committing each row separately, and you should also use multi-row INSERT syntax. But it is very preferable to use LOAD DATA INFILE.

See [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/â€¦](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html)

Thank you Bill. I will take all of your recommendations, but the overhead is still...

I have written a unit test in /tests/Zend/Db/Table/TestCommon.php, function testTableInsertMemoryUsageZf1739(). This test is pretty slow, so I have marked it skipped by default, but if you want to run it just comment out the line in the test that calls markTestSkipped().

It shows that the growth in memory from inserting 100000 rows is only about 512 bytes. I don't think this growth continues, either. That is, the memory increase levels off, and it is not proportional to the number of rows inserted.

I assume your application is already running other code that makes its memory usage very close to the maximum declared in the memory\_limit value in your php.ini file. Then when you insert a lot of rows, it is just too much. So try increasing the memory\_limit.

I found what the problem was. I was activated Zend\_Db\_Profiler... Thanks ;)
