### Description

It seems that wikification does not support documentation inline links.

 links are not displayed but completly suppressed. links are only displayed as text but not as link.

See Zend\_Date chapter Overview does not display in wikification

 
            <link linkend="zend.locale.date.normalize">Zend_Locale_Format::getDate()
            </link>


is only displayed as text but not as link. It seems that "linkend" as in-document-link is not supported.

This should be integrated if possible. It's not only used in Zend\_Date but also in other documentation parts.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
