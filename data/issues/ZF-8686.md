### Description

Hi,

I noticed the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu doesn't work properly with chained routes (having one hostname route into chain), because it doesn't seems to mark properly the active page with active class. I guess is a matter of wrong Zend\_Navigation\_Mvc\_Page isActive or something...

Sample routes config used for this:

 
        $hostnameRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Hostname(
            ':subsite.domain.com',
            array( 'subsite'=>'www' ),
            array( 'subsite' => implode('|', $subsites) )
        );
    
        $typeplain = new Zend_Controller_Router_Type(
            ':type/:rank/:id/*',
            array('module'=>'resources', 'controller'=>'types', 'action'=>'view', 'rank'=>'latest', 'id'=>0),
            array('type' => implode('|', $types), 'rank'=>'latest|sponsored|recommended', 'id'=>'\d+')
        );
    
        $router->addRoute('type', $hostnameRoute->chain($typeplain));

Sorry, was my own code error... That's not an issue.

Reporter claims no longer an issue.
