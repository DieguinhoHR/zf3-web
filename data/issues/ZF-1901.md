ZF-1901: ViewRenderer.php issues warning because $currentPaths is not an array

### Description

in \\Zend\\Controller\\Action\\Helper\\ViewRenderer.php

in initView()

$currentPaths is assumed to be an array by the foreach loop.  
 but this variable can be a string also, in which case the foreach loop emits a warning.

i fixed my copy with

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $currentPaths = array_merge( (array) $currentPaths);
    


which makes $currentPaths if it is not already.

Without the fix, a warning is printed to my webpage.

Scheduling for 1.0.3

I suspect the OP was using an old version of ZF at the time of reporting. Currently, initView() calls $view->getScriptPaths() to set $currentPaths, which always returns an array. No fix is necessary at this time.

Nope, I was not using an old version of ZF.  
 I was using ZF 1.0.1 when I encountered this problem. Also, I upgraded to ZF 1.0.2 and still had this problem.

Note, however, that I use Smarty for my views. I use the code labeled: "As an example, the following is one potential wrapper for Smarty:" at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.scripts.html#zend.view.scripts.templates) and also the integration method from [http://nabble.com/Re%3A-Demo-application--p1218672…](http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Demo-application--p12186729s16154.html)

I can upload my file if you need it but I would have to clean it up a bit.

So, I think the bug is still there for Smarty views.

I'll make a note that I need to fix the example in the docs, but as that is not a part of the official distribution -- i.e., it's not a class we distribute with Framework -- I consider this a relatively minor issue.

I think this is an important (and easy) fix because anyone who tries to use zend framework and smarty (using the current ZF docs) will run into this:

ERRNO: 2 TEXT: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() LOCATION: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Action\\Helper\\ViewRenderer.php, line 322, at November 22, 2007, 12:18 am Showing backtrace: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer.initView() # line 350, file: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Action\\Helper\\ViewRenderer.php Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer.init() # line 136, file: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Action\\HelperBroker.php Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker.\_\_construct(Object:indexController) # line 128, file: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Action.php Zend\_Controller\_Action.\_\_construct(Object:Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http, Object:Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http, Array[0]) # line 214, file: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Dispatcher\\Standard.php Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard.dispatch(Object:Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http, Object:Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http) # line 920, file: C:...\\zend\_framework\_head\\Zend\\Controller\\Front.php Zend\_Controller\_Front.dispatch() # line 119, file: C:...\\run.php require("C:......") # line 15, file: C:...\\index.php

and then they have to roll up their sleeves and start debugging instead of learning how to use the controller -- it's an unpleasent user experience for newbies!

Using the tip from earlier comments, I think the fix is a 1 line change in the documentation for the sample Smarty class for Zend\_View: In the function getScriptPaths(): replace: return $this->\_smarty->template\_dir; with: return array($this->\_smarty->template\_dir);
