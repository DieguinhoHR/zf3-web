ZF2-173: Fix classname references inside classes and tests
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2012-02-23T22:49:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-02-25T08:27:43.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

There are wrong package references inside the code and tests.

For example: $this->assertEquals("Unknown Zend\_LDAP option: $optionName", $e->getMessage()); should be: $this->assertEquals("Unknown Zend\_Ldap option: $optionName", $e-

> getMessage());

Actually some unit tests are failing by this reason.

I will try to fix this.

Seems to be very outdated tests too.

Fix testInvalidOptionResultsInException() fail because classname was wrong.

Fix all PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined method ZendTest\\Ldap\*\*\*\*Test::assertType()

Change old Zend\_LDAP references to Zend\_Ldap, also some typo on classnames like Zenda\_Ldap was fixed too.
