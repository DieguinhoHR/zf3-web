### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // in a Zend_Controller_Action
    $this->_helper->viewRenderer //OK
    $this->_helper->viewrenderer // fatal error


Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker \_\_get() and then getHelper() methods call for self::\_normalizeHelperName(). That sanitize method does not return camelCaseHelperNames so the Stack returns false to the object query, and HelperBroker then uses $helper->getActionController() ; resulting in a PHP fatal error : call to method on a boolean in our case : false

See the related bug #ZF-5111 which says that the PriorityStack object is case sensitive and then viewRenderer != viewrenderer (for example)

I think that Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::\_normalizeHelperName() should return camelCased helper names for them to be found in the stack or at least make a check before the method call.

This is the intended behavior. Action helper names are case sensitive, and must start with a lowercase letter.
