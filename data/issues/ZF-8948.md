### Description

When a complexType contains itself (recursion), this is currently blocked when producing a WSDL file.

This patch allows for such recursion.

The pactch I've supplied works for me.

But I'm not convinced that the recursion fix is 100% as ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class SingleEntity{
           /** @var SingleEntity[] */
           public $Entities = array();
    
           /** @return SingleEntity */
           public function SingleEntity(){
                   return new SingleEntity();
           }
    }


produces types of ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">


and I've no idea if that is valid.

I'm new with this, so please check this.

Patch to allow direct recursion - that is type A contains a entry of type A.

This script is a really dumb script to show that the WSDL file can now be produced where an entity has an element of the same type as itself.
