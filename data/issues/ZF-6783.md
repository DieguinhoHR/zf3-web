### Description

I can not find any workable solution for replacement of existing photo in PWA by GPhoto API . Only add/delate functions can be applied for a photo binary data. If I try to replace image like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $photos = new Zend_Gdata_Photos($client);
    $photoQuery = new Zend_Gdata_Photos_PhotoQuery;
    $photoQuery->setUser('default');
    $photoQuery->setAlbumId($albumID);
    $photoQuery->setPhotoId($photoID);
    $photoQuery->setType('entry');
    
    $photo = $photos->getPhotoEntry($photoQuery);
    $uri = $photo->getLink("edit-media")->href;//get url for edit media
    $fd = $photos->newMediaFileSource($filename);
    $fd->setContentType($type);//"image/jpeg"
    $photo->setMediaSource($fd);
    $photo->save($uri); //send PUT request


it doesn't work! I tried to find any descriptions how to do this In documentation but failed. Maybe there is some hack to resolve this problem, but I do not know where to get information... Why don't exist analog of Python's UpdatePhotoBlob function in PHP client library? Please help!

The same discussion you can find in ZF-1105 issue. Please prove the last statement from there.

Set component , add code tag and auto reassign
