This issue is marked as performance improvement, but did you do any benchmarks on this issue?

from php doc: {quote}ob\_get\_clean() essentially executes both ob\_get\_contents() and ob\_end\_clean().{quote}

this is a simple bench out (runs 1000000):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ob_get_clean: 0.54880809783936
    ob_get_contents + ob_end_clean: 0.63402605056763


-> I know it only a mini difference but the code is a little bit more clean.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $data = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    // vs.
    $data = ob_get_clean();

Hi @Marc

This issue only will be applied in release 1.11.3 because already was generated the tag 1.11.2 these case should be regenerated the tag or merged changes to tag. Anyway enter in contact with [~matthew].

Greetings Ramon Henrique Ornelas

I'm re-opening so that it doesn't get included in the release changelog, as it was applied after the tag and packages for 1.11.2 were created. I'll close again once the release has occurred.
