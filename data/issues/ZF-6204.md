### Description

When adding a stylesheet for a dojo the method would be better to switch between the CDN or local versions depending on whether dojo is hosted on CDN or locally. Currently you have to rewrite the entire path.

$this->dojo()->addStyleSheet( '/js/dojox/grid/resources/Grid.css' )->addStyleSheet( '/js/dojox/grid/resources/tundraGrid.css' );

becomes

$this->dojo()->addStyleSheet( $this->dojo()->getCdnBase() . $this->dojo()->getCdnVersion() . '/dojox/grid/resources/Grid.css' )->addStyleSheet( $this->dojo()->getCdnBase() . $this->dojo()->getCdnVersion() . '/dojox/grid/resources/tundraGrid.css' );
