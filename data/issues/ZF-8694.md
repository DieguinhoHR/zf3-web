### Description

There exists an issue with Zend\_Form translating labels which becomes apparent when Zend\_Translate logging is enabled.

When a form is rendered the form loops through the decorators running their render method. The following code is called as a result of rendering the label.

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label Line #253

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $label = $element->getLabel();
            $label = trim($label);
    
            if (empty($label)) {
                return '';
            }
    
            if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
                $label = $translator->translate($label);
            }


The above code retrieves the label from the element object and the runs validation methods and then proceeds to translate the message. Below is the code for the $element->getLabel() method.

Zend\_Form\_Element Line #606

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getLabel()
        {
            $translator = $this->getTranslator();
            if (null !== $translator) {
                return $translator->translate($this->_label);
            }
    
            return $this->_label;
        }


As you can see this method ALSO translates the text before sending it back to the decorator. This means the Element object is returning translated text back to the decorator which then is attempting to translate already translated text. This causes the Zend\_Translate class to log a notice in its log file notifying the user it is missing a translation.

The fix is an obvious one, simply removing the duplicate code from the Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label dealing with translation will solve the problem as their corresponding elements should already be translating the content for them.

Please note this also is affecting the Submit button and I have not been able to trace which decorator is causing that problem, although I assume the problem is the same. You will probably want to check through all of the decorators to check if any others are doing the same.

With reference to the final note about the Submit button, this has been reported as [ZF-8764](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8764).

For us this issue is very important, as far as we have an interactive translation mode. It allows to change the site texts right where you see them in the graphical user interface. To do this we have to append stuff to translated strings on the runtime. Like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    set_include_path(
        implode(
            PATH_SEPARATOR,
            array(dirname(__FILE__) . '/library', get_include_path())
        )
    );
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    
    Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance()->registerNamespace('Zend_');
    
    class TrickyAdapter extends Zend_Translate_Adapter_Array {
        public function translate($messageId, $locale = null) {
            return parent::translate($messageId, $locale) . '[XY]';
        }
    }
    
    Zend_Registry::set(
        'Zend_Translate',
        new Zend_Translate('TrickyAdapter', array('en' => array()))
    );
    
    function simple_form() {
        return new Zend_Form(
            array(
                'method' => 'post',
                
                'elements' => array(
                    'title' => array(
                        'type' => 'text',
                        
                        'options' => array(
                            'label' => 'Bug title',
                        )
                    ),
                    
                    'submit' => array(
                        'type' => 'button',
                        'options' => array(
                            'label' => 'Send',
                            'type' => 'submit',
                        )
                    ),
                )
            )
        );
    }
    
    echo "\n" . simple_form()->render(new Zend_View()) . "\n\n";


Under ZF 1.9.7 the code above outputs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


    Bug title[XY]
    
    
     
    Send[XY]

While under ZF 1.10.0 and 1.10.1 it's:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


    Bug title[XY][XY]
    
    
     
    Send[XY][XY]

The question is whether the translation should be restricted to the element's or the Label decorator's getLabel() method. I think it makes the most sense to place the translation in the decorator - as close to the user as possible, but I am not sure if this change will break anything depending on the element doing the translation.

 

 

Posted by Tomáš Fejfar (tomas.fejfar@gmail.com) on 2010-12-27T04:05:18.000+0000

The only legitimate place to translate the value is where the value is received - i.e. in element's getLabel() method. Decorator's purpose is to receive some value and wrap it around the current content. Not tu modify it in any way.

This can be fixed fast, by commenting these lines

- Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit - Line 80 to 83 <-- These most be also commented since you already call the parent method get label, which will result in a double translation from Zend\_Form\_Element
- Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label - Line 260 to 263 <-- Decorator should not be used for translation, it is out of purpose

OK, it's bug hunt days again. Time to bump this issue. Any chance to see it fixed this time? It's been around for ages, as well as the proposed simple fix, like in the previous comment.

BTW, the issue with Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit has been silently fixed in the meantime, but it still occurs with Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label.

Patch attached. Holger - where did you check that the issue with Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit has been already fixed. It wasn't in my trunk.

 

 

Posted by Holger Schletz (hschletz) on 2011-05-28T09:36:19.000+0000

It has not been fixed in Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit itself - in fact, removing the translate() call there would result in an untranslated label. Something else in the code path has changed so that now only Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label is still affected.

I don't know where this change has been made and whether the new behavior is intentional or just happened to stop the bug from occurring. The facts are: with the current implementation, the label gets translated once for Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit::getLabel() (correct) and twice for Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label::getLabel() (incorrect). This might need more investigation, but removing the translate() call from Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label::getLabel() would at least be an interim solution that actually works. It could easily be reverted if it turns out to be the wrong place for the fix.

The fix has been proposed and known to work flawlessly by several users for a long time, so I think it would be safe to provide it as a working solution. There are already discussions about restructuring and where translations should actually be done, but that's more of a long term goal.

Somewhere between 1.11.7 and 1.11.10, a change to Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit was introduced. The label no longer gets translated if the patch to Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label is applied. If that patch is reverted, the problem with the double-translated labels shows up again.

An updated patch that works for 1.11.10 is available at [http://svn.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/_checkout_/…](http://svn.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/development/Zend.diff?root=braintacle)

The updated patch of Holger works also fine for me in v1.11.11. Thanks!

Got an entire day wasted figuring out why my label is translated into the wrong text.

For example we got a tag english "or" Translated to dutch to "of" Got translated again english "of" to "van"

Please fix this with the remove translate from the decorator label. That seems to be the right solution.

btw the latest svn revision 24561 still has this problem

Removing the translate code block from: Form/Decorator/Label.php Form/Decorator/Description.php Form/Element/Submit.php

Since translate happen in Form/Element.php, It works fine in my application and solve this issue in v1.11.11 i believe

No updates??

 

 

Posted by Tobias Petry (ice-breaker) on 2012-09-04T16:06:54.000+0000

Any updates? The bug is still existent in 1.12.0

 

 

Posted by Frank Brückner (frosch) on 2012-09-04T16:17:38.000+0000

@[~ice-breaker] The patch needs a review by the cr-team.

Hi,

While it's still under review, I would propose the following fix for the Zend\_Form\_Element Class.

The below allows to pass an arg (named "translation\_params" in the proposed fix) through the "attribs" property of the form element that will be used as the variables within the label. In our case, this was necessary because labels may depend on some vars, so we needed a way to pass this vars to the the translator. As the translator doesn't handle vars per default, I had to use the view helper which already handles that.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

 
    public function getLabel()
    {
        // if there is a label to translate,
        // then we check for a valid translator to perform the translation
        if ( $this->_label !== null
                && null !== ($translator = $this->getTranslator())) {
            return $this->getView()->translate(
                    $this->_label,
                    $this->getAttrib('translation_params')
                );
        }
    
        return $this->_label;


 }
==

Regards, Frej.

- Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit was fixed with ZF-8764.
- Zend\_Form\_Element contains no translation in the getDescription() method.
- Only Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label needs an update.
 


 

Posted by Frank Brückner (frosch) on 2013-01-22T12:07:52.000+0000

Fixed on trunk (25242) and release-1.12 (25243)

(Unit test for Description decorator included.)
