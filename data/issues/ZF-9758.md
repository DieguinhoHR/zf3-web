ZF-9758: Zend\_Translate throws exceptions only compatible with PHP>=5.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Translate throws exceptions with a third parameter "previous" which is only compatible with PHP>=5.3 This produce a PHP FATAL error on PHP<5.3

ZF requirements is PHP>=5.2.4 so this should be fixed, either by adding the "previous" parameter in Zend\_Exception constructor and implementing the getPrevious() function, or removing this "previous" parameter in the 3 calls of Zend\_Translate\_Exception in Zend\_Translate.

Zend\_Exception does add this parameter in PHP < 5.3, could you supply some reproduce code so that this can be verified?

(Check: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Exception.php))

My mistake. I encounter this bug in ZF 1.7.8 / 1.9.2 / 1.9.7. For 1.10.x I've only checked for the Zend\_Translate Exceptions and didn't verify that Zend\_Exception was fixed. Sorry about that.

Closing as non-issue for Zend\_Translate Fixed by Zend\_Exception several releases ago
