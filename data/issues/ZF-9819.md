### Description

On the quickstart guide [Create a Model and Database Table](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.create-model.html), there is an error with the code for displaying the Guestbook comment details in the view script (application/views/scripts/guestbook/index.phtml).

The code is as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // ...
    <?php foreach ($this->entries as $entry): ?>
    <?php echo $this->escape($entry->email) ?>
    <?php echo $this->escape($entry->comment) ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>
    // ...


The $this->entries property contains Application\_Model\_Guestbook objects and as the email and comment instance variables are protected, the getters should be used to fetch the data. I have tested the code and it doesn't actually output anything.

The code should read:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [...]
    <?php foreach ($this->entries as $entry): ?>
    <?php echo $this->escape($entry->getEmail()) ?>
    <?php echo $this->escape($entry->getComment()) ?>
    <?php endforeach ?>
    [...]

The model also uses the magic \_\_get method, so both $entry->email and $entry->getEmail() should work.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __get($name)
    {
        $method = 'get' . $name;
        if (('mapper' == $name) || !method_exists($this, $method)) {
            throw new Exception('Invalid guestbook property');
        }
        return $this->$method();
    }

As Maxell noted, the magic method "\_\_get" proxies $entry->email to $entry->getEmail(); as such, the code as written works as expected.
