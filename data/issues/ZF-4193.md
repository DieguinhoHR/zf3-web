### Description

It would be a good idea for Zend\_Paginator to filter or validate (as appropriate) that the page number being set is actually a number. The docs state it is good practice to make sure it's a number in the route but this may not always be possible, or the feature may be used in another way. Therefore Zend\_Paginator should make sure the data given to it is of the correct type.

The same should also apply to setItemCountPerPage() and any other functions which require user input.
