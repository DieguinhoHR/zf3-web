### Description

In the documentation on page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.feed.writer.html) there is a function setCategories(). This functions seems not to exists. After some research a function named addCategory() seems to do the exact same thing. So there might be a naming error.
