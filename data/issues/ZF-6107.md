### Description

Hello,

refering to documentation master\_file (deprecated) option shouldn't be used anymore and master\_files should be used instead. But still in current version 1.7.6 this doesn't work! Please correct documentation or even better implement as soon as possible! ;-)

Thanks in advance regards Bjoern

it seems to be a bigger problem

master\_file is deprecated in SVN trunk and docs in trunk are coherent

in 1.7 branch, master\_file is not deprecated and docs in 1.7 branch are coherent

but the online manual seems to be the trunk manual (and not the 1.7 branch manual)

it seems to be a problem, doesn't it ?

to give an example : search "master\_files" (with a trailing "s") in Zend\_Cache-Frontends.xml file, not found in 1.7 branch, found in trunk and found in the online official manual

Set component and auto re-assign
