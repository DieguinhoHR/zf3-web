### Description

manual: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.response.html)

In first example "Example 25.28. Instantiating a Zend\_Http\_Response Object Using the Factory Method"

a static method factory() is called: $response = Zend\_Http\_Response::factory($str);

but the class doesn't have one. The correct method is fromString().
