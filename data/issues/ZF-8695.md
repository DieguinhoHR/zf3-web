### Description

It would be nice if Zend\_Db\_Select->where could accept an array as its argument.

For example, $select = $dbTable->select()->where(array('id' => 5, 'active' => 1));

I dont think this would be too hard to implement, as far as I can see, the function would be modified to something like this:

public function where($cond, $value = null, $type = null) { if(is\_array($cond) { foreach($cond as $key => $var) { $this->\_parts[self::WHERE][] = $this->\_where($key, $var, null, true); } } else { $this->\_parts[self::WHERE][] = $this->\_where($cond, $value, $type, true); }

 
        return $this;
    }
