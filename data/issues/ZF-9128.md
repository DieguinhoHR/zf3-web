ZF-9128: error\_handler modifiable by user!
-------------------------------------------

### Description

A user is able to modify the error\_handler parameter very easily through the URL. This variable should have an extra level of protection and not be modifiable, even from user-land. Otherwise a little bit of havoc can occur.

Example:
========

If you set up your error controller as suggested at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.plugins.html) like so: class ErrorController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action { public function errorAction() { $errors = $this->\_getParam('error\_handler'); var\_dump($errors); switch ($errors->type) {} } }

A user can simply go to: [http://domain/error/error/error\_handler/FOOBAR](http://domain/error/error/error_handler/FOOBAR)

The above would echo: string 'FOOBAR' (length=6)

So then the script starts to breakdown when you do $errors->type, since $errors is now just a string. Then it can get worse from there

This occurs even when getting the error\_handler via userland obviously: $request->getUserParam('error\_handler');

I think there should be special protection on error\_handler, or perhaps another way to access the error\_handler.

Hello - anybody going to look into this one? I think it could be considered relatively important.

Modified the Zend\_Tool so it now checks for a true error\_handler object instead of a string (r23726).
