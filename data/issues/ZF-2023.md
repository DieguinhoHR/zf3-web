ZF-2023: Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar sample code doesn't list setReminder or addExtendedProperty when listing valid commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-10-01T17:06:04.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-26T12:56:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.4 (26/Feb/08)

### Description

When running demos/Zend/Gdata/Calendar.php without any arguments, a list of valid commands is output to stdout. This list is missing the following commands:

- setReminder
- addExtendedProperty

These commands are already recognized properly and have interactive help, so they just need to be added to the help text which is output when a command isn't issued by the user.

Added additional commands to output and verified that the commands outputted are equal to those in the case statements.

_Code review for r7056_

The fix looks good conceptually, though there's a syntax error. The new strings end with a semi-colon (;) rather than the concatenation operator (.). Since fixing this is trivial, I've gone ahead and corrected this in r7059.

With that applied, it looks good to me.
