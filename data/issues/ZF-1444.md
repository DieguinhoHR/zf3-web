### Description

Currently noController setting in viewRenderer reset for each controller. I think noController setting should be global for all controller.

in my bootstrap:

$c=Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $vr=Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getExistingHelper("viewRenderer"); $vr->setViewSuffix( "php"); // globally setting $vr->setNoController( true );

my path layout:

app/ controllers/ views/ views/scripts views/scripts/form1.php views/scripts/form2.php views/scripts/header.php -> global views/scripts/footer.php -> global

I don't like to assign header and footer to view vars, I love the simple PHP way (using include) ^^

in my form1.php:

include "header.php"

// ....

include "footer.php"

that's why i want to use noController option in viewRenderer

I've added a 'neverController' flag to the ViewRenderer to allow the option of globally disabling the controller subdirectory for resolving view script paths. Usage is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $viewRenderer->setNeverController(true);


As of r5306.
