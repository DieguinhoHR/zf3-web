Zend\_Date\_DateObject::date() calls php's date function...

It works exactly as php date.. It can not have an other result than php date !!!

Please give a full example.

    <pre class="highlight">
           January      1970
    Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                 1  2  3 
     4  5  6  7  8  9 10
    11 12 13 14 15 16 17 
    18 19 20 21 22 23 24 
    25 26 27 28 29 30 31 


 
    <pre class="highlight">
     case 'D':  // day of week, 3 letters, Mon - Sun
         $output .= date('D', 86400 * (3 + self::dayOfWeek($date['year'], $date['mon'], $date['mday'])));


According to docblock for dayOfWeek() it returns an integer from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday). From the code copied above, if we add 3 to 0 (Sunday) and multiply by 86400, we get January 3rd, which is a Saturday. Thus, the date() in Zend\_Date\_DateObject is off by 1 day. In order for the code above to work correctly, it needs to add January 4th to the "dayOfWeek()" return value, since January 4th is the beginning of the week in January 1970, which is then given to PHP's date(), in order to obtain the desired weekday name.

The following unit tests apparently expect the wrong value, and thus do not report the error:

I should have mentioned that the unit test failures above occur, after fixing the "off by one" error by changing the '3' to a '4' in the line of code referenced above.

Reassigning to Thomas.

Do you need me to create a unit test for this issue?

No I know where the problem is related...

But also to mention. This issue only occurs if you are bejond the 32bit timestamp which php supports. It is only relevant for dates < 1902 and > 2037
