ZF-8090: Using addDecorator/Decorators block default form decorators to be loaded

### Description

The example code blocks default form decorators to be loaded because form decorator array isn't empty anymore. Instead of checking emptiness of $\_decorators array, setter functions could set $\_disableLoadDefaultDecorators var to true?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Class My_Form extends Zend_Form {
        public function init() {
            // Want to add div. Note that setter isn't used and
            // default decorators are mentioned to use (dwim)
            $this->addDecorator(array('mytag' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'div'));
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function loadDefaultDecorators()
        {
            if ($this->loadDefaultDecoratorsIsDisabled()) {
                return;
            }
    
    -->     $decorators = $this->getDecorators();
    -->     if (empty($decorators)) {
                $this->addDecorator('FormElements')
                     ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dl', 'class' => 'zend_form'))
                     ->addDecorator('Form');
            }
        }

The frak I was trying to say here was that default decorators should have been set at the first call of addDecorator() if they weren't disabled. So instead of doing this ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // class extended from Zend_Form
    public function init()
    {
        $this->loadDefaultDecorators()->addDecorator(array('mytag' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'div'));
    }


... I could have done that

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // class extended from Zend_Form
    public function init()
    {
        $this->addDecorator(array('mytag' => 'HtmlTag'), array('tag' => 'div'));
    }


I tried to fix this by calling loadDefaultDecorators() in addDecorator() but end up into infinite loop - of course. To get this work a phantom decorator something like this had to be added, making the code bad looking?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function loadDefaultDecorators()
    {
        if ($this->loadDefaultDecoratorsIsDisabled()) {
            return $this;
        }
    
        $decorators = $this->getDecorators();
        if (empty($decorators)) {
    -->     $this->_decorators['phantom'] = null; // protect against infinite loop of adding decorators
            $this->addDecorator('FormElements')
                 ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dl', 'class' => 'zend_form'))
                 ->addDecorator('Form');
    -->     unset($this->_decorators['phantom']);
        }
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function addDecorator($decorator, $options = null)
    {
    
       ...
    
    --> if (empty($this->_decorators)) {
    -->     $this->loadDefaultDecorators();
    --> }
        $this->_decorators[$name] = $decorator;
    
        return $this;
    }


Matthew - it's your call to commit the patch or not. I can live with the both.

Decided to make the decision by myself - won't fix.

Just wanted to note: this behavior is by design. It's to allow configuration-driven forms; without this behavior, it's difficult to provide a custom list of decorators to use _instead of_ the defaults. While there _is_ the "loadDefaultDecoratorsIsDisabled" flag, a change such as you suggest would break existing forms that did not set this but _did_ expect that the configuration would override defaults.
