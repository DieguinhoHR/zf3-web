ZF-2010: Static methods poorly written
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-09-28T03:33:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-11-15T14:09:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.3 (30/Nov/07)

### Description

getSymbol, getShortName and getName - each of these static methods shares 90% of code :-/

These methods are also inconsistent with the constructor. When you pass invalid currency to constructor, you get an exception: {color:red}Unknown currency '$this->\_shortName' passed{color} but when you pass invalid currency to the static methods, it just uses the default currency for region instead (really unexpected behaviour).
