### Description

The docblock says that you can use a string, array, or Zend\_Db\_Select object as the first parameter with union, but the code does this right away:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!is_array($select)) {
                $select = array();
            }

Do you have any potential use cases for an api that would support both string and Zend\_Db\_Select?

Initially I had been trying to use a Zend\_Db\_Select object, actually. I was expecting to be able to do something similar to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $union = $factoryB->select()->join('related', 'related.related_id = object.object_id', array())
                                ->where('related.related_id = ?')
                                ->setIntegrityCheck(false);
    
    $select = $factoryA->select()->join('related', 'related.related_id = object.object_id', array())
                                 ->where('related.related_id = ?')
                                 ->union($union)
                                 ->setIntegrityCheck(false);
    
    return $factoryA->fetchAll($select);


This would be also a case where I might want to UNION a string that was custom-written for the second set of results. I didn't really expect that I need to have a fresh Zend\_Db\_Select object that gets called with UNION and an array.
