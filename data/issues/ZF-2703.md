Though it may indeed make sense to add a removeValidator() method, why do you need to remove a validator from a validation chain? I'm curious about the use case context.

cause i've objects stored in a PHP session (it's a stateful application), there could happen the case that the programmer needs to add and remove validators from the chain (fields that based on some conditions are mandatory, and when something happens in the system, they must not be mandatory anymore)

if you want to know more this system is P4A (<http://p4a.sf.net>) but the website is really old and you should check the development blog on my blog [http://fabrizioballiano.net/category/things-i-do/â€¦](http://fabrizioballiano.net/category/things-i-do/p4a/)

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Validators added to the chain are not identifiable. This feature will not be implemented.
