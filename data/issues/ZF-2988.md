### Description

I didn't want to add a custom validators and decided to override my form's isValid() instead. Doing my custom logic there was straightforward, except that I couldn't set the errors on my elements as they are managed internally by Zend\_Form\_Element with no public accessors.

I propose that we add public accessors for errors and messages. It makes sense regardless of the use case I demonstrated.

Currently, you always have to write your own validator, in order to get an error in the stack. I also think it'd be usefull to have a method to push your own custom errors into the error stack on a per element basis:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myElement->addError('key', 'error message');


It would also be convenient to be able to do this on form level, where the input would be an array:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->addErrors(Array $myCustomErrors);

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Can this please include hasErrors()?

An example use case would be determining whether or not to add an 'error' class to a tag when using the ViewScript decorator:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


        // label/element output here
