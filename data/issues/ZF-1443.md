### Description

Seems there is a bug or something into Zend\_Service\_Amazon.

I can't get any results using any sample from Manual (using my won API key of course):

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.service.amazon.html)

By accessing directly (sample, by Rest) AWS services seems to be all fine.

I posted this under fwd-general but seems is none using Zend\_Service\_Amazon.

Hi Cristian,

Can you please post the code needed to reproduce the problem (excluding your API key, of course :) )?

Thank you!
