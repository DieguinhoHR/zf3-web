### Description

There should be support fo LOCK IN SHARE MODE just as there if for FOR UPDATE. I'm willing to do the patch, but i didn't find enough information about standard SQL. PostgreSQL has FOR {UPDATE | SHARE} syntax for example ([http://arpug.com.ar/trac/wiki/â€¦](http://www.arpug.com.ar/trac/wiki/sql-select.html#ClausulaFORUPDATEFORSHARE)) . Adding this feature would suppose this locking methods to be exclusive with each other. A single method for selecting type seems more accurate.

Thank you for your attention.

Hi,

Please, is there any chance we can have Zend/Db/Select/Mysqli.php for example? I am really interested in developing the patch.

I also know this could involve modifying other methods which use Zend/Db/Select. This wouldn't actually break backward compatibility. Anyone calling Zend/Db/Select directly wouldn't notice this change at all!

Just answer a yes or no. That's all i need.
