### Description

hi, for the mysqli adapter the prepare method does not return a zend\_db statment so there is a inconsitence.

Eugene is working on fixing the mysqli adapter that is in the incubator/ folder.

What file version do you use?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
         * Prepare a statement and return a PDOStatement-like object.
         *
         * @param  string  $sql  SQL query
         * @return Zend_Db_Statment|PDOStatement
         */
        public function prepare($sql) {
            
            $this->_connect();
            return $this->_connection->prepare($sql);
            
        }


In it's turn $this->\_connection is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_connection =& new mysqli($this->_config['host'], $this->_config['username'], $this->_config['password'], $this->_config['dbname']);


So the prepare method should return prepared mysqli statement per [http://ru2.php.net/manual/en/…](http://ru2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysqli-prepare.php)

i use the svn version 3 weekd ago, i do not know the revison number, because i exported it. the creation date of the file is 03.10.2006 - 00:46 and size is 8.764kb

the prepare method works, but what i mean is that it is not consitencewith the rest of the statments.

I tried to make it compatible with all other adapters. mysqli\_statement do not have all requiered methods and I use mysqli\_result sometimes in the code. Finally it works I believe.

where can i get the changed files?!?

i searched in the svn but could not find it.

hmm i looked up in the code and found that many things are missing for example in the abstract class Zend\_Db\_Statement there is no property $this->\_connection, but is used in class

missing : protected $\_connection = null;

in the class Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli the method execute refers to a property that does not exist $this->\_db line #104

should be $this->\_connection->getConnection()

What are you talking about?

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli herits from Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Line 71:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Then, see Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli.php, line 275
    


Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli has nothing to do with Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli. I tried to adapt Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli, but there were too much methods mysqli\_stmt does not have. Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli works directly with mysqli\_stmt. I will change it in future versions, a bit later.

Saqib, please update to the latest version of SVN. Normally, we only address bugs in the most current version of the framework, since we are still working on preview releases of the ZF. Please follow the instructions below to update to the most current code (and most current version of the mysqli adapter in the incubator directory):

Assign to Bill Karwin.

Implementation is complete in revision 3639. All Zend\_Db unit tests pass using the Mysqli adapter.
