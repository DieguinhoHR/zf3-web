### Description

If you have a class implementing an Aware interface, the only way to inject setters it defines is via DI preferences. You cannot specify alternates on a per class basis, such as the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $di->configure(new Configuration(array(
        'instance' => array(
            'Foo\Bar\Baz' => array(
                'foo' => 'Foo\Bar\Foo', // where the "foo" parameter is defined in an "Aware" interface
            ),
        ),
    ));
