ZF-10664: cannot send file using Zend\_Rest\_Client 
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2010-11-09T13:07:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-11-08T22:49:38.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Ex:

$client = new Zend\_Rest\_Client($someDomain);

$httpClient = new Zend\_Http\_Client(); $httpClient->setFileUpload('/var/www/test/public/images/cat.jpg', 'picture');

$client->setHttpClient($httpClient);

$response = $client->restPost('/somecontroller/2');

/\*\* this code is not working because when you call restPost will call \_prepareRest() in code below

 
    final public function restPost($path, $data = null)
    {
        $this->_prepareRest($path);
        return $this->_performPost('POST', $data);
    }


and \_prepareRest() will call resetParameters()

in line

self::getHttpClient()->resetParameters()->setUri($this->\_uri);

and this will erase all uploadedFile from variabile $files in method resetParameters($clearAll = false)

 
        // Reset parameter data
        $this->paramsGet     = array();
        $this->paramsPost    = array();
        $this->files         = array();
        $this->raw_post_data = null;


So the files cannot be sent by restPost()

This Fix is the problem.

I am currently fixing the problem that Zend\_Rest\_Client can't send PUT data. I think that after that fix is committed, you should be able to upload a file using restPut. I will link the issue.

I have created a solution wiht an extra function setNoReset($bool = true) that you can call prior to calling restPost(). No reset of the Zend\_Http\_Client will take place if you set the noReset flag. Would this solution be acceptable? I am working on the unit test (to simplify it). After I'm finished, I'll upload the patches. I would like to know if adding this extra call is acceptable.

Added patches for the Rest client and the test.

Based on your [the reporter] (private) feedback, that I requested, I agree that this is only a workaround. However, if you are looking to post files with Zend\_Rest\_Client you are doing it wrong. Zend\_Rest\_Client is a high level client, that is intended for use with Zend\_Rest\_Server, as it is designed at present. Future implementations will likely be able to talk to different types of servers, but as it is now, Zend\_Rest\_Client is only a convenient way to call class methods on the server as rest methods. Therefore, if you want to post a file, you should create a method on the server that can take a filename and file contents as arguments. An example server would look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class TestClass {
        public function saveFile($contents, $filename)
        {
            $path = '/tmp/' . $filename;
            file_put_contents ($path, $contents);
            return file_get_contents($path);
        }
    }
    
    class RestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        public function indexAction()
        {
            $server = new Zend_Rest_Server();
            $server->setClass('TestClass');
            $server->handle($_REQUEST);
            exit();
        }
    }


A request to this method could look like this: [http://localhost/rest/â€¦](http://localhost/rest/?method=saveFile&contents=bogus&filename=harry_potter)

And the response would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    bogussuccess

Recommend to not integrate in ZF 2
