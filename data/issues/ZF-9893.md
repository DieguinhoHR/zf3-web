### Description

I just switched from zendFramework 1.9.4 to 1.10.4, and the Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap stopped working.

I tried to replace the lib with the old 1.9.4 library tree (left other parts of the framework to 1.10.4), and everything worked fine. I switched the library between the 2 versions several times and verified that was the piece which made difference.

Here is the ini file

ldap.server1.host = myhost.mydomain.com ldap.server1.accountDomainName = mydomain.com ldap.server1.accountDomainNameShort = mydomain ldap.server1.accountCanonicalForm = 3 ldap.server1.username = "CN=myusername,CN=Users,DC=net,DC=com" ldap.server1.password = "mypass" ldap.server1.baseDn = "DC=net,DC=com"

The code: // get $username , $password from input. $config = Zend\_Registry::get('config'); $options = $config->ldap->toArray(); $adapter = new Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap($options, $username , $password); $authresult = $this->\_auth->authenticate($adapter);

The log:

Ldap 0: Invalid credentials Ldap 1: 0x31 (Invalid credentials; 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 525, vece): CN=myusername,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com Ldap 2: host=myhost.mydomain.com,accountDomainName=mydomain.com,accountDomainNameShort=mydomain,accountCanonicalForm=3,username=CN=myusername,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com,password=\*\*\*\*\*,baseDn=DC=mydomain,DC=com Ldap 3: liua authentication failed: 0x31 (Invalid credentials; 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C090334, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 525, vece): CN=myusername,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com

I checked the 1.10 document [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.adapter.ldap.html), the ladp sample code looks fine with my code.

What needs to be changed? Is this documented somewhere ?

Thanks

It seems that you're trying to authenticate against an Active Directory server.

Can you please try to remove

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ldap.server1.username = "CN=myusername,CN=Users,DC=net,DC=com"
    ldap.server1.password = "mypass"


from your configuration and try if you can authenticate? Normally the username and password settings are only required for LDAP servers that only allow DB-binds and the adapter has to retrieve the correct DN prior to authentication (this is for example true for an OpenLDAP server). Active Directory on the other hand can bind users with their DN, their fully qualified username (such as DOMAIN\\user or user@domain.local) and depending on the configuration even with their domain-less plain username.

No feedback from OP - issue closed

most likely a configuration issue
