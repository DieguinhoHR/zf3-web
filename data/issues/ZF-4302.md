### Description

Organize a call to vote for the ZF support in the Netbeans IDE, like Symfony : [http://symfony-project.org/blog/2008/…](http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2008/09/11/support-symfony-inclusion-in-netbeans) to gain more visibility and a time-saving development tool

Today ZF is going to loose this opportunity : [http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/…](http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/issue_145913_historically_the_most)

Sorry if this issue isn't really one or if my english is too bad, it's not my native language and I'm not familiar with issues trackers.

I already sent a mail to the list. I don't know how Symfony motivated ~350 to vote, but I wouldn't feel comfortable trying to drive up our numbers artificially. We'll just have to rely on our popularity for this one. :)
