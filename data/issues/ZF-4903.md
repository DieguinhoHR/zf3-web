I have this issue with ZF 1.8.1

Fatal error: Access to undeclared static property: Zend\_Uri\_Http::$\_config in /var/lib/php/ZendFramework-1.8.1-minimal/library/Zend/Uri/Http.php on line 142

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once('../application/bootstrap-nomvc.php');
    
    $query = 'select * from geo.places where text="B1" and country = "United Kingdom"';
    
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql">http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql</a>');
    
    // Adding several parameters with one call
    $client->setParameterGet(array(
        'q'      => $query,
        'format' => 'xml'
    ));
    
    $response = $client->request('GET');

This issue seems to be fixed, please update Zend Version 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 which probably have this error.
