### Description

The function setFileUpload() uses mime\_magic's mime\_content\_type(). Since mime\_magic was declared deprecated and is replaced by PECL's Fileinfo extension. $PHP\_SOURCE\_ROOT/ext/mime\_magic/DEPRECATED reads:

To keep existing code originaly coded for mime\_magic without changes you may add the following compatibility wrapper function to your codebase:

function mime\_content\_type($file) { static $finfo = false;

 
    if ($finfo === false) {
        $finfo = finfo_open(MAGIC_MIME);
    }
    
        if (is_resource($file)) {
                $buf = fread($fp, 65536);
                return finfo_buffer($buf);
    } else {
            return finfo_file($file);
    }


}

I think it would be best if the ZF includes this wrapper function and use it in the event the mime\_magic extension is not loaded and Fileinfo is. This issue is important in FC for instance, where the mime\_magic extension is not available in the FC repository and PECL's Fileinfo is but it is also a generally good idea.

Resolved in rev. 9906 - Both fileinfo and mime\_magic will now be used in attempt to detect mime type

Can the documentation be updated: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.introduction.html) The requirements page still shows mime\_magic as a hard dependancy.

Hmm.. I didn't even know that page in the docs existed :)

Table updated, fix in trunk r23440, will be merged to 1.11 soon.
