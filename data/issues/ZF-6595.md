ZF-6595: zf.sh not catch fatal error
------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Task Created: 2009-05-10T05:00:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:30.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Following the quickstart, on page concerning sign process and Zend\_Form, I made a mistake creating "zf create action guestbook" instead of "zf create action sign guestbook" so logicaly an action "guestbook" has been created in the index controller.

I tried:

zf delete action guestbook index
================================

It was a test, no matter for me if it works or not, but i think this fatal error should be avoided and catch:

Fatal error: Call to a member function getValue() on a non-object in /usr/local/zend/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/ArgumentParser.php on line 388

Is there any reason why this marked as TRIVIAL error is still in stable release? Reported over month ago, new release came out and this bug is still there.

Please do fix this: I love ZF\_Tool but this makes it nigh on impossible to use.

Any updates on this? This issue also affects 1.9,6 when using the zf command line:

$zf delete controller Foo

results in the following error message and stack trace.

Fatal error: Call to a member function getValue() on a non-object in /usr/share/php/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/ArgumentParser.php on line 388

Hope this helps.

Actually, had a look at the docs [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.tool.project.providers.html)

Doesn't look like the delete feature is implemented just yet.. Guess we'll have to wait.
