ZF-12002: Zend\_Currency compares floating point values

### Description

Zend\_Currency comparison methods are comparing floating point values instead of monetary values. I think that makes those methods unusable because in practice people only want to compare fixed precision numbers when they deal with currency.

e.g when I'm working with 2 digit precision I want $1.01 to be same when compared to 1.010101

While this is not a bug, I still feel it's not the right way to do it.
