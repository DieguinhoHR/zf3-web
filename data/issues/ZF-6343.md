### Description

Would be nice if the .htaccess file created by Zend\_Tool added the php\_flag short\_open\_tags on in it.

This would cause a internal server error in combination with php running through mod\_fcgid on apache, please do not implement this!

It would cause the following error-message:

{quote}{color:red} [alert] [client 82.XXX.XXX.XXX] /path/to/your/zfproject/.htaccess: Invalid command 'php\_value', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration{color}{quote}

Of course the invalid command would be _php\_flag_, but _php\_value_ also creates this error.

If this really needs to be enabled, please wrap it in . This wouldn't error out with php-cgi.

You are right, didn't think about this. I'd either use: {quote} php\_flag short\_open\_tags on {quote}

Or:

{quote} php\_flag short\_open\_tags on {quote}

Our policy regarding short\_open\_tag has changed. While we previously encouraged its use, the fact of the matter is that in the php.ini-recommended settings, it's disabled, which causes issues when going between servers. We have since re-thought our position, and are no longer recommending their use in ZF projects. Zend\_Tool's code generation has been updated to use normal tags. If you need short tags for your project, you are encouraged to enable the setting in your .htaccess, server settings, or php.ini.
