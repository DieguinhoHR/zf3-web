ZF-10009: Search Lucene returns not enough hits for the given search string
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In some cases the search for 'dingo' returns no results, however the search for 'ding' return the correct hits, although the index contains documents with the text 'dingo'.

To resolve this, modify the class SegmentInfo.php from line 1912:

------------ from ---------------------- } else { // We have reached term we are looking for break; } ------------ to ------------------------ } else { // We have reached term we are looking for $highIndex = $mid; break;

}
-

Because delta can be exact 0 if strcmp for a term in the middle match (line 1905). Then, highIndex can be 520, lowIndex 500. For further serch, the hightIndex should start at the current match with the index '$mid=510' and not 520 !!!
