### Description

Zend\_Locale-Introduction ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.introduction.html)) mentions (section "Usage of automatic Locales") the variable HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE which in fact, does not exist at all. There is a key of this name in the superglobal $\_SERVER variable.

In the file Zend\_Locale-Introduction.xml: line 294 reads: HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE. it should be: $\_SERVER['HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE'].

Thomas Weidner has found (and fixed) the same error on line 242 (which I overlooked in the original issue description) but the one on line 294 is still there.
