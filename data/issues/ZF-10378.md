ZF-10378: Zend\_Db throws exception on empty result set
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I'm not sure what is going on here, as I'm sure this is a very common use case: {quote} $this->db = Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::getDefaultAdapter(); $select = $this->db->select()->from('category')->where('alias = ?', $alias); $result = $this->db->fetchRow($select); {quote} OR as the docs state: {quote} $stmt = $select->query(); $result = $stmt->fetchRow(); {quote}

When $alias is a value that is not in the DB, I get and exception thrown: bq. SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: no parameters were bound

When $alias is set to a value that is in a record, I get a row returned. So basically, when an empty recordset is returned, I get this exception thrown.

When using Zend\_Db\_Table, I've never experienced such behavior. I would expect an empty result to be returned rather than and exception. When I run the SQL that echoing $select produces, I get no errors, just an empty result set.

It's possible I am doing something wrong. I wanted to test for illegal input and got this exception, which is unlike Zend\_Db\_Table. There are no question marks (?) or single quotes (') in $alias. It can be pure alphabet and I still get this thrown.

Edit: your variable probably is null or unset or something.

I tried making the same query without Zend\_Db (directly with PDO), and it fails. So I'm going to see W..T..F is wrong with my machine, but it seems there is an underlying problem.

I've installed the project on another machine and it works. So looks like something else was wrong. I thought it was very strange as this is a common use scenario. This can be closed.
