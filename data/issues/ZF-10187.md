ZF-10187: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial clears Variable on Clone

### Description

I'm not sure if this is a bug.

When u use an Zend\_Paginator and assign a view with additional variables. The variables are not available inside the view script (phtml).

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $paginator = new Zend_Paginator(new Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Null(100));
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber(1);
    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(10);
    $paginator->setPageRange(10);
    $this->view->assign('paginator', $paginator);   
    $this->view->assign('someOther', "value10");   


<paginator.phtml>

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    echo $this->someOther; --> will be null


it seems that the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial clears the variables inside the cloneView() method and the PaginationControl executes this method:

<PaginationControl.php>

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    public function paginationControl(Zend_Paginator $paginator = null, $scrollingStyle = null, $partial = null, $params = null)
    {
       .......
       return $this->view->partial($partial, $pages);
    }


<Partial.php>

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    public function partial($name = null, $module = null, $model = null)
    {
      if (0 == func_num_args()) {
        return $this; 
      }
    
      $view = $this->cloneView();
      .......
    }

partial() and partialLoop() are intended to provide a clean scope for the rendered view script, and only present those variables that are explicitly passed to them. Paginator uses a partial (instead of calling render()) to ensure that the variable scope is not cluttered, and to ensure it is clean when rendering the partial (particularly important since its a part of the ZF library, and we cannot know what else has been set in the view).

Hi Matthew,

Thanks for your explanation. How should i access some other variables inside the view script (paginator.phtml)? I need this for building the correct paging URLs.

regards,

Please use the "{ code }" tags.
===============================

Look at the method "paginationControl" and the last parameter.
