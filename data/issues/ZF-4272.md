### Description

In Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row you can set the read-only flag When you call save method there is an exception but in delete method there is no such warning

There shoud be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($this->_readOnly === true) {
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Row/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception('This row has been marked read-only');
            }
