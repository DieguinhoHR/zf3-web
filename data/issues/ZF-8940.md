ZF-8940: Zend\_Measure\_Weight LB/LBS to KILO conversion value is incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Zend\_Measure component's Zend\_Measure\_Weight class defines the LB/LBS class constant values as being equivalent to 0.45359237 of a kilogram. This is incorrect; 1 kilogram is equivalent to 2.20462 lbs.

That number is rounded. From Wikipedia:

{quote}The United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations agreed upon common definitions for the pound and the yard. Since 1 July 1959, the international avoirdupois pound has been defined as exactly 0.45359237 kilogram.[8]

In the United Kingdom, the use of the international pound was implemented in the Weights and Measures Act 1963.[9] The yard or the metre shall be the unit of measurement of length and the pound or the kilogram shall be the unit of measurement of mass by reference to which any measurement involving a measurement of length or mass shall be made in the United Kingdom; and- (a) the yard shall be 0- 9144 metre exactly; (b) the pound shall be 0- 45359237 kilogram exactly. â€”Weights and Measures Act, 1963, Section 1(1) {quote}

1/0.45359237 = 2.204622622 1/2.204622622 = 0.45359237

Proposing to close as not an issue.

Hi Dolf,

Indeed you are correct regarding the actual conversion value; perhaps I misstated the problem and instead should have included a bit of code as something does not seem right with the conversion process:

$locale = new Zend\_Locale('en'); $unit = new Zend\_Measure\_Weight(1, Zend\_Measure\_Weight::KILOGRAM, $locale); echo "CONVERT: ".$unit->convertTo(Zend\_Measure\_Weight::LBS);

So the goal is to convert 1 kilogram into the corresponding number of lbs. Executing this code produces the value:

CONVERT: 2.0 lbs

In actuality, this should be 2.2 lbs, no?

The default rounding is 2 as with ZF 1.10. But you can change the precision simply by using the second parameter $round.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ->convertTo($unit, $round);


Note that in no single case the rounding will be as long as possible. This would lead to unexpected returned values.

But using your example on trunk I get

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CONVERT: 2.20 lbs

Closing as non issue

FWIW I have confirmed that this example does not work on Windows XP running Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.2.12, returning 2.0 both using the provided code sample and in the case that the $round parameter is provided per Thomas' direction. It does indeed work as expected (returning 2.2) on Ubuntu Server 9.1.

I don't think that the system is the problem.

I have used XP with Apache 2.2 and 5.2.11 (default installation) for my tests with the given return values.

As wether the OS nor the webserver have effects on how PHP calculates. You may not have noted that I wrote "trunk"... it's possible (I think I remember that) that within the old 1.9.x releases the initial value has been used for expecting the precision when no precision has been given.

2.0 indicates to me that precision has been set to 0 before calculating (by using a non-precision value) and only the output is extended to 1 precision.

Another way would be to set the type manually and output the value as wished

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ->setType($type);
    ->toString($round);


This works also in 1.8 and below when the precision has not been detected.
