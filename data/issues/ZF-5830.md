ZF-5830: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select doesn't allow use of $select->columns('..')
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select doesn't allow use of $select->columns('..')

code fragment: $tbl = new Category\_Table(); $select = $tbl->select()->columns('id');

Results: Zend\_Db\_Select\_Exception: No table has been specified for the FROM clause in /usr/share/php/Zend-1.7.5/Db/Select.php on line 224

Expected: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select should already have a table when created from a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract.

Bug?: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select's from clause isn't set till assemble()

Agreed.

I already told Zend (ralph probably) that a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select _should be given it's own table_ in the from clause, just after creating it. It's not logic to have a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select entirely empty at creation, it should at least contains its own table as its first from clause.

See :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // that's not logic
    $table->fetchall($table->select()->from($table, array('my', 'cols')));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // that seems more logic
    $table->fetchall($table->select()->columns(array('my', 'cols')));

Turns out just adding the from in the setTable doesn't act as expected.

$select = $tbl->select()->columns('id'); would still include an all columns in the select.

'select `table`.\* , `table`.`id` from `table`'

Attached is a patch I used to fix the bug for me.

short version: Added a different version of the columns method for the class that includes the 'from' on demand. If a column not from the primary table is requested, it will throw an error. Seemed logical since the assemble for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select would throw for any columns not in the primary table.

This issue is already known as ZF-3239. It's a tricky one and hard solve without BC issues. A real patch probably won't be available until ZF 2.0, where we can break the BC a bit. Although I would love to be proven wrong in this case ;)

Since 1.9 there has been a feature in place that allowed select() to be called on a table with that will load the from part into the object.

Please see [here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.qry.rows.set.refine.example), and the api doc [here](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Db/Table/Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.html#methodselect)

I think it might fix this problem.

Was fixed as of 1.9. Marking issue closed.

I got this error, today on Version 1.10.6.

Got the same error today. Version 1.11.5

Also using Version 1.11.5, replicated the issue using this code:

 
    public function fetchThumbnailBarContents()
    {
        $table = $this->getTable();
        $select = $table->select()->columns('index_image')->where('status=1')->order('created')->limit(9);
        return $table->fetchAll($select);
    }


and:

 
    public function getTable()
    {
        if (null === $this->_table) {
            require_once APPLICATION_PATH . '/models/DbTable/IndexImages.php';
            $this->_table = new Model_DbTable_IndexImages;
        }
        return $this->_table;
    }


All other pulls from the same pattern work fine, but when I try to specify just the index\_images column I get error message:

Message: No table has been specified for the FROM clause

Luckily enough, it's a lightweight table and I was just doing minor performance tuning, but it would be nice if this could be resolved.
