### Description

I did not found a hint in the docs that some of the resource plugins are stored in the registry. So I stored them myself in it, e.g. Zend\_Translate with key 'translate' - so it available twice in the registry...

This was confusing to me and causes some discussion in the german zfforum.de: <http://www.zfforum.de/showthread.php?p=46707>

Translate, locale and navigation (maybe others) are stored in the registry when using the resource plugins. So a hint in the docs would be great i think..

It was decided not to mention the registry options for \_Navigation since that is not the preferred way of storing it. The bit on the locale plugin was added on trunk, and documentation on the translate plugin will follow soon.
