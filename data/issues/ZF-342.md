### Description

It would be useful for the Zend\_Mail component to be able to send signed/encrypted email using the S/MIME standard. This could further guarantee that the email originated from the server, encryption could increase security in various applications that may pass customer information like email addresses and phone numbers in server generated email.

Unassigning so someone else can pick it up.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Closing old issue - as per Wil's "or that we will never fix" cleanup request. Re-open it if anyone plans to work on this.
