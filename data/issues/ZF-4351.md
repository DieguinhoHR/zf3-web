### Description

The example shows excellent what's wrong:

for( $i=1990; $i<2010; $i++ ){ $oDate = new Zend\_Date( $i . '-01-1' ); echo $oDate->toString("YYYY-MM-dd") . '  
'; }

outputs:

31-12-1991 should be 1990-12-31 31-12-1992 should be 1991-12-31 31-12-1992 should be 1992-12-31 31-12-1993 should be 1993-12-31 31-12-1994 should be 1994-12-31 31-12-1995 should be 1995-12-31 31-12-1997 should be 1996-12-31 31-12-1998 should be 1997-12-31 31-12-1998 should be 1998-12-31 31-12-1999 should be 1999-12-31 31-12-2000 should be 2000-12-31 31-12-2002 should be 2001-12-31 31-12-2003 should be 2002-12-31 31-12-2004 should be 2003-12-31 31-12-2004 should be 2004-12-31 31-12-2005 should be 2005-12-31 31-12-2006 should be 2006-12-31 31-12-2008 should be 2007-12-31 31-12-2009 should be 2008-12-31 31-12-2009 should be 2009-12-31

This is not only for the 31th of December, but it shows nicely what goes wrong.

However the y-MM-dd format produces the right output.

Please read the manual

YYYY is the calendar year... yyyy is the real year.
