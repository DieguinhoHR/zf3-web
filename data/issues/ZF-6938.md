### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Word\_UnderscoreToCamelCase can't handle numbers. Given the string 'address\_1', the filter will output 'Address\_1'. I don't know if this was done intentionally, but if not, it is a bug. I personally don't see why numbers would be omitted.

For the record, this applies to Zend\_Filter\_Word\_SeparatorToCamelCase, which is the base class of Zend\_Filter\_Word\_UnderscoreToCamelCase.

The coding standard say: "Numbers are permitted in class names but are discouraged"

This is the reason why this filter does not allow classnames beginning with numbers.

Feel free to extend this filter with a own one when you are in need of a classname beginning with a number.

The use of this filter extends much beyond anything to do with class names. The intended functionality is to take a string, any string, and return a camel cased version of that string. Using a number in a string is perfectly valid.

The "intended" functionality is it's usage within Zend\_Controller to convert given classnames to directory and reverse. This is the reason why this filters are actually not documented.

Second reason I closed this issue as won't fix: This is a "word" filter... 1 is no word as words begin always with a alphabetical character. When you give 2 words then both words have to be words and not integers. "adress" is a word but "1" is no word. By using Word\_UnderscoreToCamelCase you said... " I have a string which consists of multiple words which are concated with a underscore char.... please seperate them erase the underscort and make them CamelCase.

Got it. I didn't take the use of the term "word" so literally as it reduces the flexibility of working with strings. Also, this class can turn the string "aaa\_aaa" into "AaaAaa", and "aaa" is not a word. Maybe the class should be called Zend\_Filter\_Alpha\_SeparatorToCamelCase or Zend\_Filter\_ControllerClassName\_SeparatorToCamelCase. I'll just go ahead and use my own regex. Thanks.
