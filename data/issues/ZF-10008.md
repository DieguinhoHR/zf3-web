### Description

The shared memory segments, semaphores and related files (\*.shm and \*.sem) are never being deleted when the process is stopped. shmod\_delete and shmop\_close function are simply ignored ...

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    class executeThread extends Concentre_Console_Process_Unix
    {
        protected function _run()
        {
            for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
                // Doing something really important which can't wait: sleeping
                sleep(1);
            }
        }
    }
     
     $thread1 = new executeThread();
     $thread1->start();
     
     $thread2 = new executeThread();
     $thread2->start();
     
     
     while ($thread1->isRunning() || $thread2->isRunning()) {
        sleep(1);
     }


I'm running PHP 5.2.6 under debian.  
 Below I've paste shared memory segments summary output after script execution.

ipcs -m

Seems that when process is forked php is unable to control shared memory. I've try to create segment /semaphore with the same code as in ZendX\_Console\_Process\_Unix class but without forking and it works !

Segments are created and deleted perfectly.
