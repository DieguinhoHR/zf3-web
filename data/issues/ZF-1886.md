Have you tried setting EOL in your transport ($transport->EOL = "\\r\\n")? It seems to be a similar issue as in ZF-589.

Please apply this patch to get this bugfix into the next release. This bug causes some mailservers to reject mails because of wrong linefeed.

Please list the mail servers that have issues with the line feed being \\n.

AFAIK, \\n is a industry acceptable line ending in mime despite what the RFC claims.

If possible, please make a case with examples/screenshots/error messages for changing the linefeed from \\n to \\r\\n.
