### Description

I need to calculate the body of a Zend\_Rest\_Client object so I can add the length to the header Content-Length.

There is a toString method in the Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result class that allows you to output the XML why not add one to the client class?

I'm not sure it makes sense to do so, considering the current architecture of the REST client. Currently, it simply makes HTTP GET and POST requsts -- no XML is actually transmitted in the request. In other words, the content length of a given request will be governed by, at most, the values being passed in a POST request. Additionally, this is automagically taken care of by Zend\_Http\_Client when the request is actually made.

For this request to have more value, the REST client would need to be able to send over XML as raw POST data -- something not currently supported.

Current architecture does not support feature request.
