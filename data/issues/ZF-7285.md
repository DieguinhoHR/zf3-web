ZF-7285: helper option not removed from Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Captcha\_Word attributes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-07-15T04:22:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-24T11:14:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Captcha\_Word does'nt unset the option helper when rendering the hidden and the text input. So we have an unknown attribute named "helper" in the HTML.

In Zend/Form/Decorator/Captcha/Word :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function render($content)
        {
            [..]
            $attribs = $element->getAttribs();
            unset($attribs['helper']);
            $hidden = $view->formHidden($hiddenName, $element->getValue(), $attribs);
            $text = $view->formText($textName, '', $attribs);

That was fixed in ZF-5855
