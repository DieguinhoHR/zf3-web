ZF-7155: Manual Search is useless!

### Description

The 'search the manual' function of the documentation is absolutely useless, failing to return any results for many search terms which should clearly be there, and returning useless results for many others. Not having content list at the top of the manual pages exacerbates this. Some examples:

Suppose I want to look at the docs for partial view helper: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=partial&language=en&search=Search+Manual)! (1 result; 24.3. Using the Book Search Data API)

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=partial+view+helper&language=en&search=Search+Manual)! (4 pages of results; although one of the early ones is for the view helper page, as there is no content list at the top of the page, the only way from there is to search the page until you find what you want.

Suppose I want to look at the docs for the EmailAddress validator: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=EmailAddress&language=en&search=Search+Manual)! No results.

It would be better just to use Google site search; it's at least a quick fix that would make it usable.

You're reporting two very distinct and separate issues: (1) you feel the search does not return sufficient results, and (2) individual manual pages do not have a TOC.

(2) is a limitation of DocBook -> HTML rendering. There may be a way to allow it, but I'm not going to make it a priority for the team based on this single complaint.

(1) is likely a Zend\_Search\_Lucene issue (as we use Z\_S\_L to index the manual as well as to search that index). However, that said, I'd like a list of search terms you've encountered that do not return results so that we can test.

Fair point; if the search linked to the correct anchor in the page, then the T.O.C. would be a trivial issue at best. I don't know if Z\_S\_L can do this or not.

I'll add comments to this issue as I come across search terms that give what I feel are incomplete / inaccurate results. I've had this problem for months and finally got frustrated enough to file an issue :-)

Part of the problem is that the search results page doesn't return any context for the links, and with the long manual pages, this can be confusing.

For instance, I want information on using the context parameter of the Zend\_Form validators: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=validator+context&language=en&search=Search+Manual)! The relevant page is actually second on the list, '23.3. Creating Form Elements Using Zend\_Form\_Element [en]', but it's far from obvious from the title alone that this is a relevant result (there are 2 pages of results for this query). Adding a few lines of context a la Google would make the search much more useful: [http://google.co.uk/search/…](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:framework.zend.com+validator+context)

Even though the correct result is further down the list, it's easier to locate.

Headscript - no results: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=headscript&language=en&search=Search+Manual)!

htmltag - no results [http://framework.zend.com/manual/search/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/search?query=htmltag&language=en&search=Search+Manual)! I'll keep posting these until you tell me you've got enough.

I'm not surprised that searching on "headscript" and "htmltag" are returning no results -- as they are stubs of full class names. In these particular cases, I'd say that Lucene is doing the correct thing-- there are no tokens generated for the words you're searching for as they don't exist as distinct words anywhere in the manual pages.

Try searching on Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript and Zend\_View\_Helper\_HtmlTag -- these return plenty of results.

Regarding the idea of including context, that may be possible for us to do, and I'll look into it.

Fair enough - I know almost nothing about Lucene, but I'm still surprised that the 'headscript' search fails - the word appears a half-dozen times on the page as a distinct word, as a section heading '60.4.1.8. HeadScript Helper', link, and in other text.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html)

Anyway, the context should really help - thanks.

@Matthew: I implemented Lucene for my own version of documentation: Headscript returns me less page than Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript but it returns me some results: [http://mikaelkael.fr/doczf/search.php/…](http://www.mikaelkael.fr/doczf/search.php?zf_version=1.9%E2%8C%A9=de&query_search=Headscript) [http://mikaelkael.fr/doczf/search.php/…](http://www.mikaelkael.fr/doczf/search.php?lang=en&zf_version=1.9&query_search=Zend_View_Helper_HeadScript)

To generate TOC in each page (TOC of the section, not the one of the chapter), you have to parameterize: html.xsl.in with addition of
