### Description

In Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Term there are two methods: getTerm() and getTerms(). getTerm() returns $this->\_term, which is fine. getTerms() wants to return $this->\_terms, which doesn't exist. So when calling this method, you'll get:

Notice: Undefined property: Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Term::$\_terms in Zend/Search/Lucene/Search/Query/Term.php on line 200
