### Description

This code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $className = $this->getPluginLoader()->load(strtolower($resource), false);


cause problems with loading bootstrap resources that contains uppercase letters inside their names. For example, I implement bootstrap resource My\_Bootstrap\_SomeComplexName in My/Bootstrap/SomeComplexName.php, and then trying to do smth like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bootstrap->getPluginLoader()->addPrefixPath('My_Bootstrap', 'My/Bootstrap');
    $bootstrap->getPluginLoader()->getPluginResource('SomeComplexName');


This cause exception, because plugin loader trying to load My/Bootstrap/Somecomplexname.php, and this is error (in my humble opinion).

this is easy to fix by removing strtolower from the code at the top of the issue.

This is actually by design and documented; it's to prevent issues with case sensitivity in the resource names.

We may revisit it for 2.0, but for now, closing as "not an issue".
