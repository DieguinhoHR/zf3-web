### Description

the query parser failed to fetch any search result in a search if we specify a very long number range query in string, for example:

mod\_date:[200810120000 TO 200812112359]

this is required if we indexed and search with date + time values in the format of yyyymmddhhmm where "hhmm" is the 24 hour and minutes.

\*\*\* however query object created by "Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Range" returns correct result

somemore details, on turning on the query parsing exception:

exception error message returned "At least one range query boundary term must be non-empty term"

but I don't have any boundary terms empty !!

Same issue here, with an YYYYMMDD field.

I get exactly the same error. When I run the same query defined programmatically, it works like expected.

I use ZF 1.10.3

I ran into a similar problem when working with spatial ranges. Looking into it, I'm not sure this is a bug in code, maybe just a problem with documentation. Seems like pure numbers are not allowed by the default parser, but numbers are allowed in a different parser. Consider:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // problem reported:
    try {
        Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::parse('longitude:[04000000 TO 10200000]');
    } catch (Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception $ex) {
        // expected -- parser expects alpha characters in terms
    }
    
    // change parser to use one that allows numbers (more robust, slower to parse)
    // @see <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.extending.html">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦</a>
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(
        new Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_TextNum_CaseInsensitive()
    );
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::parse('longitude:[04000000 TO 10200000]');
