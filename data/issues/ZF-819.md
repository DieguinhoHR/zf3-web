### Description

I would like to suggest that some improvements be made to Zend\_View, mainly to promote the use of fluent interfaces. I see that some components are doing this but it has not been widely implemented. I believe most of the add and set methods in this object lend themselves well to a fluent interface.

Could this possibly be suggested across the board for all the components?

P.S. This is my first time ever contributing so if I've done this in the wrong place, I apologise.

Added fluid interfaces to all setter methods in Zend\_View\_Abstract in revision 3058.

If you want to see fluid interface improvements elsewhere in ZF, please open another ticket specifying each module that needs them.

Would it not be appropriate for the add methods to offer a fluent interface also?
