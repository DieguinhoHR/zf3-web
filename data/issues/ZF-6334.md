### Description

When I try Example 33.4. Sending Multiple Mails per SMTP Connection from [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.multiple-emails.html) first of all I get a warning message "inet\_pton(): Unrecognized address localhost" and if I change the $host parameter of constructor to different IP ADDRESS NOT HOSTNAME, the warning message continues to emerge.

Also as I noticed in code of Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp->\_sendMail method it tries to execute next line $this->\_connection->helo($this->\_name);. Is it proper line or it should be like this $this->\_connection->helo($this->\_host);}?

_P.S._ I think _for_ loops in examples 33.4 and 33.5 have mistakes for ($i = 0; $i > 5; $i++) { it will never do any iteration because of condition $i > 5. It should be $i < 5

That's TRUE. What is the "\_name" property used for?

Apparently, only for that call. It's set in the construct method from $config['name'] value (if set). By default, its value is "localhost".

Does it make sense to duplicate the 'host' value? Or are we missing something about "helo" method?

Thanks

Hi, Marcos.

The $\_name is used for sender hostname. It is different from $\_host which means receiver's one.

I think the document seems to be bit difficult to understand how to use helo() function.

So, I will update the document.
