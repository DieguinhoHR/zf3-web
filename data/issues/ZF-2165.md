### Description

I recently installed Fedora 7, previously was on Fedora Core 6. Also upgraded ZF to 1.02. The following code was working under under FC 6, but does not work now. I get an html 500 error, using , firefox 2, IE-7,IE-6.

require\_once 'Zend/Feed.php'; // Fetch the latest Slashdot headlines try { $slashdotRss = Zend\_Feed::import($site); } catch (Zend\_Feed\_Exception $e) { // feed import failed echo "Exception caught importing feed: {$e->getMessage()}\\n"; echo "  
report problem to webmaster  
"; // exit; }// Initialize the channel data array

It dies when trying to catch the exception, no error just stops. The $site variable is set correctly. The URL works from the browser address line so I know it is still there. Any help would be appreciated.

I suppose this is your problem [http://nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/zend-feed-issue--tf4928553s16154.html)

Could you post here the URL for the feed you are trying to load? I mean, the value of $site variable.

I apologize for not posting the fix on this forum. It turned out I was missing the DOMDocument class. Apparently Fedora 7 and 8 do not contain it as a default.

I finally started to look at the log files and they told me what was wrong. I kind of got busy and forgot to post the answer. I hope this helps someone else.

This was the error message in the log file

[Wed Oct 31 02:59:46 2007] [error] [client 192.168.3.1] PHP Fatal error: Class 'DOMDocument' not found in /usr/local/lib

/php/Zend/library/Zend/Feed.php on line 195,

I subsequently loaded the missing class using an rpm and all was well.
