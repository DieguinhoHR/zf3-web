ZF-6030: Accept Zend\_Config object in factory
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-03-14T01:23:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-24T12:40:49.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently the Zend\_Cache::factory method does not accept Zend\_Config as an object.

I would suggest that, calling the function with just one parameter which is instance of Zend\_Config does search for a valid config with the keys:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config->frontend;
    $config->backend;
    $config->frontendOptions;
    $config->backendOptions;


This would greatly enhance the use of the factory.

I am not convinced.

Because you can already do something like that :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Cache::factory($config->frontend, $config->backend, $config->frontendOptions->toArray(), $config->backendOptions->toArray());


And because I do not want to impose a key structure.
