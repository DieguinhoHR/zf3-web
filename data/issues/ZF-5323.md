ZF-5323: Return the columns/fields for a row

### Description

I think it would be useful to be able to get the columns/fields from a Row or Rowset from a Row you could do

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    function getColumns()
    {
        return array_keys( $this->_data )
    }


From a RowSet you will need to get the first Row (if there is one) then run the same getColumns call. I perdonally would use this when building a sort form so providing the ability to sort or not sort via one or more columns in the database.

On second review, this functionality already exists (albeit in a slightly roundabout way). Both Row and Rowset supply a getTable() method, so this is possible:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $columns = $row->getTable()->info('cols');


I don't see any real added value to providing a getColumns wrapper around this at this late stage in ZFv1's lifecycle. If anyone disagrees, please feel free to reopen the issue.
