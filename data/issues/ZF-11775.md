### Description

Sqs class should not forcibly limit the user to 8k. The queue itself has the maximum message size attribute and that should be used PER QUEUE. The size can be from 1k to 65k and needs to configurable by the user. Allowing 8k messages on a queue that is smaller can cause unknown errors that are hard to track down. Sending messages larger than 8k right now does not throw an exception, making it hard to track down especially when the queue supports larger messages. All of this comes back to supporting the adjustable queue size based on the attribute of the queue. This becomes especially important when users are using more than just php for queue management.

I listed this as a bug due to the limit being forced on the user rather than selected from an attribute that does exist for this purpose.
