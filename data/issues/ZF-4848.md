### Description

I need \_pdfpageClass property to specify which Zend\_Pdf\_Page object is used to render page. When you use Zend\_Db\_Table you can specify which class you want to use to render row and rowSet.

It would be nice to have the samething with Zend\_Pdf allowing to set which Zend\_Pdf\_Page object you want to use.

I've extended the Zend\_Pdf\_Object to implement FPDF like methods. It works like a charm for new page but If want to load a template using my custom Zend\_Pdf\_Page object I can't ! The default Zend\_Pdf\_Page object is used !

Thank you

Since version 1.7 all Zend\_Pdf variables are protected rather than private, this allows you to extend Zend\_Pdf and overrwrite the method \_loadPages and return your personal Zend\_Pdf\_Page object.

Adding a new variable $\_pageClass variable would add new methods to the already hard to grasp PDF API.

This could be implemented without changing existing API (just one new method Zend\_Pdf::setPageClass($classname) or something like this)
