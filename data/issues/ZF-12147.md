Code to add at line 146 of Zend/Service/Twitter/Search:

 
                case 'include_entities':
                    if (true == $param) {
                        $_query[$key] = 1;
                    }
                    break;


I will do this as soon as I get some time to add myself unless anyone gets there first.
