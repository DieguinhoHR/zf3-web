ZF-7975: Strict Standards: Only variables should be passed by reference in Zend/Db/Select.php on line 246

### Description

The error comes from lin 246 where array\_keys() is wrapped in current().

This is triggering the error: Only variables should be passed by reference

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($correlationName === null && count($this->_parts[self::FROM])) {
     $correlationName = current(array_keys($this->_parts[self::FROM]));
    }


This can be prevented with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($correlationName === null && count($this->_parts[self::FROM])) {
     $correlationNameKeys = array_keys($this->_parts[self::FROM]);
     $correlationName = current($correlationNameKeys);
    }
