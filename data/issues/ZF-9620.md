Base64 isn't encryption at all, so I think that Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt is a bad place for such a filter, because this might give the suggestion that people can use it as a (safe) encryption algorithm.

What should be problematic by using

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new Zend_Filter_Encode(array('adapter' => 'Base64'));


?????

It's as save or unsave as PHP's own base64\_encode() method.

Ok, now you are confusing me, in the issue you say it will be in Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt, and in your comment you say it will be for Zend\_Filter\_Encode?

It would be great if it came in ZF as a Zend\_Filter\_Encode adapter.

But it should never be in Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt, because base64 simply is _not_ an encryption algorithm.

So I guess you mean Zend\_Filter\_Encode instead of Zend\_Filter\_Encrypt in the issue?

Looking into Incubator you can see what is being developed. This issue is just a note to myself for something which was discussed in IRC.

Closing as needs proposal. The component is ready for API review within incubator. (Part of Zend\_Validate\_Encode)
