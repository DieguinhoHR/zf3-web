Zend\_Mime\_Decode has been in the core library since the initial release. Changing the name impacts not only the class, but Zend\_Mail, the various Zend\_Mail\_Read components, all unit tests, etc. This is not a trivial change, and finally, one that will have little if no visibility as most people will not use it directly. The ROI for such a change makes no sense.

Marking as "Won't Fix".

It's been the standard response that naming standards aren't that important, even when following them does not negatively affect users in any way. I disagree--but even so, I'm not sure I understand the difficulty with the change.

From your checked-out copy of the framework:

Rename Decode.php to Decoder.php
================================

Run this Bash script:
=====================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    TRUNK_PATH = /path/to/Zend/trunk/
    for filename in $(find $TRUNK_PATH -type f -name '*.php' | sort); do
        sed 's/Zend_Mime_Decode/&r/g' $filename > $filename.sed
        mv $filename.sed $filename
        echo "Modified $filename"
    done


Run tests
=========

Check in copy
=============

Four steps that take only a few minutes to complete.

Zend Framework does not have a naming convention that requires class names to be nouns.

You have suggested that class names should be nouns, but this has not been adopted as a policy in Zend Framework.
