ZF-11032: Module configs are implied in docs, but aren't loaded

### Description

On the following pages: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/project-structure.filesystem.html) [http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.application.available-resources.html#zend.application.available-resources.modules)

Looking at the two pages in tandem one would assume athat the module bootstrapper would load the module config file, but it doesn't. The docs should reflect that module config must go into the root application.ini file (application/configs/application.ini), and that ZF has no built in automatic loading of module config files.

I guess the absence of a config options like: resources.modules.configFile = "configs/application.ini" should tell me that configs aren't loaded, but it's just not very clear.
