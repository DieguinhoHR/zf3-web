ZF-7993: CAPTCHA is generated in the main request making it slower

### Description

The CAPTCHA image is generated in the main request, then saved somewhere in the hard drive accessible by the web server and then statically linked inside the HTML Image tag in the resulting page.

This makes the page almost 10 times slower to generate. According to Apache (using %D in the log format), my page takes about 230 thousand microseconds to generate (more that 2 tenths of a second) when showing the CAPTCHA. If I disable the CAPTCHA the page takes about 28 thousand microseconds.

It would be great to be able to point the src attribute of the Image tag to a dynamic PHP request and generate the CAPTCHA there, this way the page would be fast to generate and it will be available to the user sooner while the image is being generated in the background. This way the slowness of the CAPTCHA generation is less obvious.

Besides, there might be an advantage of not needing to save the image in the server's hard drive before serving it to the browser.

I don't really know if what I'm saying is already possible but the documentation about using the CAPTCHA is not very detailed. If it is already possible please point me to the appropriate documentation.

Thanks.

I think best idea here would be to override generate() and render() methods for Zend\_Captcha\_Image in your own class and set $\_imgUrl and $\_suffix to correct values. I don't see generic enough way to do it so it will be suitable for Framework. If you have some way in mind please propose here or write a proposal.
