I have found on this tracker that Kamil Grecki has applied patch for this problem. But STILL it doesn't work for me.... If i would pass string like ```... exception is rised. I have to comment off line 143 and 135 at library\\Zend\\Db\\Statement.php to be able of continue project...

Regards Peter

This issue is still active at 1.8 ?

At every launch of every query with a ":" followed by a character inside and mysqli like adapter, the ZF launch the exception, because the regluar expression at line 123 of Zend/Db/Statement.php split the query in chunk of possibly parameters and the mysqli doesn't support the named parameters. So every query with a time in the 'HH:MM:SS" format, or with a comment, or with a regexp that specifies a ":" the query falls in a exception.

I think that the problem is in the logical of \_parseParameters() If an adapter, lile mysqli, doesn't support the named parameters, why there's the need of testing the existence any parameters?

I humbly suggest the solution of change the conditions placements or, obviously, change the regular expression at 123 to avoid the problem.

many many many thanks of all your works ps. excuse me for my poor english

I can attest that it doesn't seem to be a particular adapter problem, as this issue is occurring for me using the PostgreSQL adapter.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    object(Zend_Db_Statement_Exception)[281]
      protected 'message' => string 'Invalid bind-variable position ':days'' (length=38)
      private 'string' => string '' (length=0)
      protected 'code' => int 0
      protected 'file' => string '/home/neraath/Development/Workspace/cfegroup/library/Zend/Db/Statement.php' (length=74)
      protected 'line' => int 250


The specific query is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    UPDATE cfegroup.payment_item_training_module SET start_date = now(), end_date = now + interval ':days days' WHERE payment_id = :paymentId and group_id IS NULL


Same version as mentioned above.

Hi, we encounter this issue, too. We have a lot of SQL queries that contain URIs. HTTP URIs are no problem, for they contain a '/' after the ':'. But e.g. mailto: URIs lead to the above error message. Do you see a chance that this issue will be fixed in the not to distant future?

I am inclined to close this as not an issue. It seems like you are attempting to use bound parameters inside of quoted literals. How is the database suppose to know whether you want ':days days' or the parameritized version if its a literally quoted value?

Even without ZF this does not work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $x = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE interval = ":days days"');
    $y = $x->execute(array('days' => 30));


The above will fail with: Warning: PDOStatement::execute(): SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: :days in /Users/ralphschindler/tmp/test-pdopgsql.php on line xxx

If you want to use parameritized queries, the whole value needs to be parameritized, not part of it.
