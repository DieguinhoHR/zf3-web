ZF-12388: Zend\_Navigation is consuming too much time on render
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Performance Improvement Created: 2012-08-24T19:09:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2013-02-10T10:03:20.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I have created apc cache for Zend\_Navigation instance. I have got massive performance improvement on container init.

But still there is a problem on rendering helper.

findActive function of Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_HelperAbstract class is consuming too much time on render.

I think findActive function may use to indexing or caching adapter for following calls.

You can see my cachegrind.out

Hi Tuğrul, at this point a caching adapter for Zend\_Navigation (ZF1) is not an option.

If you can you give a proposal for implementation, then we can reopen this issue.

Maybe can pick active node and keep aside on navigation build.

I abandoned ZF1 and look at ZF2. I don't like ZF2 because there is a unnecessary confusion on ZF2.

I'm using Phalcon framework currently and building my own navigation component based on mongodb. I think dbms is very easy and fast way find active node with query and climb up throught parents using dbref.

{quote}Maybe can pick active node and keep aside on navigation build.{quote} Give me an example how would you do it. {quote}I don't like ZF2 because there is a unnecessary confusion on ZF2.{quote} Confusion? It is new and makes many things diffent, but ZF2 is much more flexible and better structured. The module structur in ZF2 is very nice! Some practice and maybe a complete project and you will no longer have any big problems. {quote} I think dbms is very easy and fast way find active node with query and climb up throught parents using dbref.{quote} A db-adapter is not a option for Zend\_Navigation in ZF1.

If you can offer a good solution, then I will write a patch and unit tests. But we can't rewrite the whole component.
