ZF-4227: useDefaultActionAlways parameters for Zend\_Controller\_Front
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Front should have a useDefaultActionAlways parameter similar to the useDefaultControllerAlways one.

This would make it consistent with setDefaultAction() and setDefaultControllerName().

I'm going to close this issue as "won't fix". There's a bigger architectural issue here that needs to be resolved with dispatching that we plan to address with 2.0. When that happens, either we'll be doing this, or the need for it will no longer be present.
