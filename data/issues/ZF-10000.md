### Description

When using where(), you can pass the optional third parameter which way the $value should be quoted. This functionality is not available for having(). It would be nice to have it.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function where($cond, $value = null, $type = null)
    
    vs
    
    public function having($cond)
        {
            if (func_num_args() > 1) {
                $val = func_get_arg(1);
                $cond = $this->_adapter->quoteInto($cond, $val);
            }


Workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$cond = $this->getAdapter()->quoteInto('count >= ?', $minimalCount, Zend_Db::INT_TYPE);
    $select->having($cond);

Can you propose a patch and unit test by chance?

Can I just say I'm jealous on this issue?

I think this patch has some problems : In Zend\_Db\_Select, line 535, a test on value is done. That can't allow us to pass 0 or "0" (or an empty string) as value.
