### Description

Zend\_Memory is nowhere to be found in the Framework manual. Since the module is in the main library, I think it should be in the docs too.

The documentation is there, and it was built and included in the ZF 0.9.3 beta release.

However, the index of manual chapters presented on the website does not have a link to the Zend\_Memory chapter. That is a mistake. The link is missing, but the files are there.

I have committed and deployed a fix to the manual view for the website to link to the chapter on Zend\_Memory.
