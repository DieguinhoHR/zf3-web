### Description

Hi,

I have the "user" table in my schema and the following code fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Data_Users extends Zend_Db_Table {
        protected $_name = 'user';
    }
    
    $users = new Data_Users();
    $users->fetchAll(); 


with the following error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[42S22]: 
    Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'user.Host' in 'field list'' 
    in D:\amp\host\projects\htlibs\Zend\Db\Adapter\Abstract.php:154


As I see, two last executed SQLs are:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(871) "SELECT c.table_schema, c.table_name, c.column_name,              
                  c.ordinal_position as column_ordinal_position, c.data_type,              
                  c.column_default, c.is_nullable, c.character_octet_length,
                  c.numeric_precision, c.numeric_scale, c.character_set_name,              
                  tc.constraint_type, k.ordinal_position as key_ordinal_position            
                FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS c
                  LEFT JOIN (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE k
                    JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS tc
                    ON (k.table_schema = tc.table_schema
                      AND k.table_name = tc.table_name
                      AND tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY'))
                  ON (c.table_schema = k.table_schema
                    AND c.table_name = k.table_name
                    AND c.column_name = k.column_name)
                WHERE c.table_name = 'user'"


and

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(983) "SELECT `user`.`id`,    `user`.`name`,
    ... skipped ...
    FROM `user`"


So it looks like the current schema is not used during obtaining fields of a table. I think that the first SQL should contain additional WHERE criterion:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    WHERE c.table_name
         = 'user' and c.table_schema='myspherecms'?


Sincerely,
----------

Alexander

It would be great if describeTable used the schema from \_config (dbname) by default if $schemaName was not supplied. I am not sure if a separate issue should be filed for this, or a does this fall within the scope of current issue.

describeTable now works well for 'user' table but only if \_schema is specified.

I have not found how I can specify default schema for adapter and it looks like I need to specify it for each Zend\_Db\_Table but this is quite uncomfortable.

Will something like the following be available soon?

$db = Zend\_Db::factory(..., ...); if ($db instanceof Zend\_Db\_Pdo\_MySql) { $db->setDefaultSchema(...); }

or it can use dbname as default schema.

Thanks, Alex
