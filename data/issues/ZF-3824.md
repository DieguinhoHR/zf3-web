### Description

I've a parenthese in my config.ini =>example : az(rt789fds

When i launch my web application, i 've some errors :

Warning: Error parsing ./application/config.ini on line 5 in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Config/Ini.php on line 108

Warning: Error parsing ./application/config.ini on line 5 in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Config/Ini.php on line 108

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Config\_Exception' with message 'Section 'Mail' cannot be found in ./application/config.ini' in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Config/Ini.php:163 Stack trace: #0 /data/www/Preview/Danone\_SensaFruits/index.php(26): Zend\_Config\_Ini->\_\_construct('./application/c...', 'Mail') #1 {main} thrown in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Config/Ini.php on line 163

Zend\_Config\_Ini uses php's parse\_ini\_file to parse this file.

[http://php.net/parse\_ini\_file](http://php.net/parse_ini_file)

To remedy your problem, perhaps try putting your password inside double quotes like so:

name = "some(value"

That should do the trick.

We have the same issue. Password is in double quotes.
