ZF2-582: Unable to set explicit Accept-Encoding header in Zend\\Http\\Client due to (perhaps) obsolete code

### Description

In Zend\\Http\\Client::prepareHeaders ([https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Http/Client.php#L1043)):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (! isset($this->headers['accept-encoding'])) {
                if (function_exists('gzinflate')) {
                    $headers['Accept-encoding'] = 'gzip, deflate';
                } else {
                    $headers['Accept-encoding'] = 'identity';
                }
            }


The "$this->headers" property is not used anywhere else, perhaps the "if" line should be something like that, according to the surrounding code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$this->getRequest()->getHeaders()->has('Accept-Encoding')) {
    ...
    }


Now the condition is always true and there is no other option to disable gzip in the HTTP response than removing the gzip PHP extension.
