### Description

I found tiny spell miss in Zend\_Pdf\_Page.

Here is a diff patch to svn HEAD.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    617c617
    <             throw new Zend_Pdf_Exception('Page is attached to other documen. Use clone $page to get it context free.');

    >             throw new Zend_Pdf_Exception('Page is attached to other document. Use clone $page to get it context free.');
