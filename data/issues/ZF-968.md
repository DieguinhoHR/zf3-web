### Description

Notice about unexistent constant is raised then using Zend\_Date such way

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-01 01:02:03');


That is a fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Index: library/Zend/Date.php

    +        if (is_string($date) && defined("Zend_Date::".$date)) {
                 $part = $date;
                 $date = null;
             }

Please give details on - your machine - your OS - your standard locale - your php version - if BCmath is enabled or not

Issue can not be reproduced as with PHP 5.1.4 and PHP 5.2.1 on Windows.

No notice is raised... Would wonder me because "@" should suppress the failure message anyway.

I'm using custom error handler, and it recieves notice and raises exception (I'm using this in development server to capture all errors and notices and clean them out before publish project to production server).

Btw, using "@" is not good. It suppresses notice output, but doesn't suppress notice itself.

And sometimes "@" has to be used.

You will have a notice also with the automatic locale detection from Zend\_Locale because there is no other way to get the locale and look if it's set or not.

Anyway... With SVN 3634 I changed the line from "constant" (which explicit supports class constants) to "defined" (which only supports normal constants). Maybe the php documentation should clearify the differences :-)

Thanks, Thomas. Can you tell me filename and line, from where I can get another E\_NOTICE? I can't find it myself.

I'm not sure what you mean...

The E\_NOTICE can be switched on and off in the PHP.ini file.

And if you want to look where other messages will be supressed just search the code for '@' signs.

I've searched, but I can't find where in Zend\_Locale and Zend\_Date other places with '@'.
