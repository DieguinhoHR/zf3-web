### Description

There are 3 flags, include\_rts, trim\_user, and include\_entities that are listed on the twitter API documentation that get thrown away by Zend\_Service\_Twitter() -- I'm having to write my own \_Service\_Twitter subclass to get around it, because I want to use the include\_rts flag.

Twitter API for call: [http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/â€¦](http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/statuses/user_timeline)

A quick patch to the Zend\_Service\_Twitter.php to allow these 3 parameters to the API call.

Flags added in trunk and 1.11 release branch, with corresponding unit test.
