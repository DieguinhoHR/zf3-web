### Description

If I create Zend\_Dojo\_Form class (with Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor) and then run it, it works. But if I disable JavaScript(in FireFox) and send an empty or fulled Form with requires, I get a string "Array" (in Editor).

Set component and auto reassign

The Editor dijit will not work without Javascript. Internally, it is represented by two elements,a textarea and a hidden element. Client-side, Dojo changes the textarea into a custom JS widget, removing the textarea entirely, and an onSubmit event writes the content of the dijit to the hidden element -- which Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor then uses as the value.

This is one area where we cannot gracefully degrade, unfortunately.
