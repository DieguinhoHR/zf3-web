### Description

The German translation of assertion is "Zusicherung" in a unit test context. The manual says "Ausnahme" which means exception.

Assigning to Thomas since he's German, and does a lot with (German) translations.

Please give the related manual pages... We can't re-read the complete manual for every mistyped word.

The component is named Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit like you can read from this issue's header, so you can find the documenation at

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/de/zend.test.phpunit.html)

Press Ctrl + F and type "Ausnahme", then press enter.

Compare each search result with the manual in English:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.test.phpunit.html)

You don't need to get harsh or ironic.

The component you selected contains 9 pages with more than 5500 words. That's the reason why I asked for the related page.

Won't fix.

Zusicherung is the wrong translation for this verb. Additionally there is no verb "Ausnahme" within the noted chapter.

You are very funny Thomas. I found "Ausnahme" more than 40 times on the German manual page linked above.

"Zusicherung" is also the correct wording for assertion. The verb should be "zusichern" (to assert).

At the moment the (German) world could thought that zf developers don't know the difference between an exception and an assertion. If you know a better translation than "Zusicherung" please let me know.

My German is not good enough to judge on this usse. But please not that Thomas wrote 'verb ausnahme', and from what I can tell, the only occurences of Ausnahme are nouns rather than verbs.

Just compare the English and German chapters. Each time when "Zusichern" should be wrote "Aushnahme" is written. It's not that difficult.

I searched the complete chapter for Zend\_Test\_PhpUnit within trunk.

There is no "Ausnahme" in the complete chapter. The verb "assertion" is translated with "Behauptung" which is the correct translation for assertion as you assert something.

I don't see how I should change verbs which are not available in the manual.

You should have searched within the links i posted above.

In German books about unit testing i always read "Zusicherung", but "Behauptung" is also ok.

Why should I search the link?

We have no access to the link you provided. But I searched within the manual which is what you noted as being failed.

You should additionally note that this issue is marked as "fixed" for the next minor release.

 

 

Posted by David Toniolo (david toniolo) on 2009-11-18T12:23:01.000+0000

I linked to the current online version of the manual, so if you follow the link you will see what this issue is about.

You say it's already fixed in trunk, that's nice.

Please stop being ridiculous.

As I said already before the community, including me as being community member, has no access to the servers from Zend which are hosting the homepage.

We have no write access to these sites. So we can't change the content from these servers.

This issue is ALREADY MARKED AS FIXED SINCE 2 DAYS FOR THE NEXT RELEASE. Which means that it will automatically being fixed with the next release for public.

There is no other way to solve such issues. We will wether build a new release for this single bug, nor change the homepage until the next release will be official released.

It's good to hear this issue has been fixed, Thomas.
