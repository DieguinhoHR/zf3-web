ZF-9555: headStyle placeholder helper does not work for XHTML
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

headStyle placeholder helper comments out the styles to support older browsers. This works fine when serving text/html, but the XML parser ignores it when serving application/xhtml+xml. This happens in Firefox 3.6 and Opera 10.10 running on Ubuntu 9.04. Not commenting out the styles for pages served as application/xhtml+xml should take care of this since not many older browsers can render XHTML anyway.
