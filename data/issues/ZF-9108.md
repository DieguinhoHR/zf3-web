ZF-9108: Zend\_Captcha\_Image always has <br/> in rendered element

### Description

At the moment it is not possible to put the input text field of an Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha besides the captcha image with css for example.

The generated code looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><img alt="f2fa4b159345bf3bd7ab7268349aa11a.png" src="/images/captcha/f2fa4b159345bf3bd7ab7268349aa11a.png"></img><br></br>

The render() method looks like this at the moment:

 
    <pre class="highlight">public function render(Zend_View_Interface $view = null, $element = null)
    {
        return '<img alt="'.$this->getImgAlt().'" src="'%20.%20$this-"></img><br></br>';
    }

So there is always a   
 in it which makes it hard to change the appearance with css.

The   
 should not be hardcoded and the output should be more flexible, so a developer can put the textfield right beside the Image.

At the moment I changed that behaviour by extending Zend\_Captcha\_Image and changing the render() method.
