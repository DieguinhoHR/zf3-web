### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">


        Options :
      
      
        opt1<br></br>opt2<br></br>opt3
      

In the HTML above, the "for" of the first label should be removed because there is no id="options".

Actually, the "for" attribute of labels can point to either the id _OR_ the input name. As such, this is still valid and correct -- there is an input named "options".

Are you sure about that ?

The W3C validator reports an error. And from W3C HTML reference :

[http://w3.org/TR/1999/…](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#h-17.9.1) {quote} for : (IDReference) This attribute explicitly associates the label with a form control. When present, the value of this attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control in the same document. When absent, the label being defined is associated with the control inside the label element. {quote}

Mea culpa -- this was evidently in older browsers that such support was implemented. Re-opening. It should point to "options-element" in this case.

What is the best location to make this change? My first thought is to do this (in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label::getId):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    Index: library/Zend/Form/Decorator/Label.php
    ===================================================================
    --- library/Zend/Form/Decorator/Label.php       (revision 24746)
    +++ library/Zend/Form/Decorator/Label.php       (working copy)
    @@ -89,6 +89,9 @@
             if (null === $id) {
                 if (null !== ($element = $this->getElement())) {
                     $id = $element->getId();
    +                if ($element instanceof Zend_Form_Element_Multi) {
    +                    $id .= '-element';
    +                }
                     $this->setId($id);
                 }
             }


I haven't checked yet to see if this has any unintended consequences, but all Zend\_Form and Zend\_View tests still pass after the above change.
