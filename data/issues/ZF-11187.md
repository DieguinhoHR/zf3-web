Your patch breaks the current behavior, because the log variable is undefined in your version. The condition is never true in this case, so no log.

Here is an explanation of the current version. You have an assignement in the condition for the log variable.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($log = $this->getLog()) {
        $log->log($message, $priority);
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = $this->getLog();
    if (false != $log) {
        $log->log($message, $priority);
    }


The feature works very well now. Why do you want to modify something?
