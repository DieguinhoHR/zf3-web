### Description

When navigating through Reference Guide, there are some pages that the right sidebar falls upon documentation, and prevents reading. It may be seen on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.core-functionality.html) as you scroll down, it's impossible to read the tables.

It would be more usable if the sidebar was coded collapsible, like the Issue Tracker's left sidebar.
