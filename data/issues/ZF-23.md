ZF-23: Zend\_Http\_Client::get() always build path string with '?'
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-19T01:18:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:27.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.4 (29/Jun/06)

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client builds a request path string like following code.

[http://framework.zend.com/developer/browser/…](http://framework.zend.com/developer/browser/trunk/library/Zend/Http/Client.php#L74) 74 $request = array\_merge(array('GET ' . $this->\_uri->getPath() . '?' . $this->\_uri->getQuery() . ' HTTP/1.0',

This code always makes a path string with "?" if URL has no querystring. ex) "/path/to/file?" But some webpages return other contents if the path string has "?" or not. ex) <http://wordpress.rauru-block.org/index.php/1354> and <http://wordpress.rauru-block.org/index.php/1354>?

So please change like this.

74 $request = array\_merge(array('GET ' . $this->\_uri->getPath() . (($this->\_uri->getQuery() !== false) ? '?' . $this->\_uri->getQuery() : '') . ' HTTP/1.0',

Development of the HTTP client currently concentrated on the incubator version which is a complete rewrite of the client.

Please test if the problem exists in the incubator version.

To learn how to use the incubator components, read this: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Zend+Framework+Subversion+%28SVN%29+Standards#ZendFrameworkSubversion%28SVN%29Standards-UsingtheZendFrameworkIncubatorComponents)

Ok, I will test the incubator version. Please close this issue.

Does not happen in the incubator version - will not fix, please use the incubator (will soon replace the old HTTP client anyway).
