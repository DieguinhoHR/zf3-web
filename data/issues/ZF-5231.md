### Description

Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect does not take into account aliased tables when Zend\_Db\_Select::DISTINCT is active inside count() method. On line 164 and 166 the table alias part of the column is completely disregarded. This has severe issues when joining tables with foreign key relationships having the same column name.
