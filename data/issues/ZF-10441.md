### Description

The code snippet at the end of this post generates:

 ...

When it should generate gallery[photo1], gallery[photo2], etc, for Zend\_Form\_Element\_File fields.

class Form\_Gallery extends Zend\_Form {

 
    public function init()
    {
        $subform = new Zend_Form_SubForm;
    
        for ($i = 0; $i <= 4; $i++)
        {
            $subform->addElement('file', 'photo'.$i, array(
                'label' => 'Photo '.($i + 1)
            ));
            $subform->addElement('text', 'legend'.$i, array(
                'label' => 'Legend '.($i + 1)
            ));
        }
    
        $this->addSubForm($subform, 'gallery');
    }


} // End Form\_Admin\_Gallery

The array notation can not be supported by the file element as this notation breaks the files when they are uploaded. This is mentioned within the documentation.

Therefor this issue is closed as non-issue.
