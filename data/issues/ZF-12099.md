### Description

Private method is not a part of object API because it is not accessible outside declared class. Thus, it can not be marked as deprecated. If it is not needed just remove it.

 
    <pre class="literal">
        /**
         * ZF-9970
         *
         * @deprecated
         */
        private function _makeId($callback, array $args)
        {
            return $this->makeId($callback, $args);
        }
