### Description

In Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable, the following code is used to generate a SQL statement:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$credentialExpression = new Zend_Db_Expr(
                $this->_zendDb->quoteInto(
                    $this->_zendDb->quoteIdentifier($this->_credentialColumn)
                    . ' = ' . $this->_credentialTreatment, $this->_credential
                    )
                . ' AS zend_auth_credential_match'
                );

which generates the following SQL:

 
    <pre class="highlight">SELECT auth_user.*, pwd  = '[[password hash]]'
    AS zend_auth_credential_match
    FROM auth_user
    WHERE login = 'admin'

Since Oracle does seemingly not support logical expressions in the part of the SELECT statement before WHERE, this query fails in Oracle. In a quick test, Oracle 10g returns the error code ORA-00923 - SQL Invalid. Suggested fix would be the following SQL statement:

 
    <pre class="highlight">SELECT CASE COALESCE(count( * ),0)
    WHEN 0 THEN 0
    WHEN 1 THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END AS zend_auth_credential_match
    FROM auth_user
    WHERE login = 'admin'
    AND pwd = '[[password hash]]'

This is supported by Oracle, DB2 and MySQL; I was not able to test it in a Postges environment since I currently do not have access to one.

Another option would be to do it the "old-fashioned" way using the following SQL:

 
    <pre class="highlight">SELECT auth_user.*
    FROM auth_user
    WHERE login = 'admin'
    AND pwd  = '[[password hash]]'

and then checking if the query returns a row to check if a user with the given name and password exists.
