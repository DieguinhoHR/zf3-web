### Description

Currently you cannot configure Zend\_Log to use a custom PHP 5.3 namespaced writer.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $config = array(
        'mine' => array(
            'writerName'      => 'Writer',
            'writerNamespace' => '\Zfns\\',
        )
    );
    
    $logger = Zend_log::factory($config);


Will fail, as it will try to find a class with the name \\Zfns\_Writer in the path /Zfns/
