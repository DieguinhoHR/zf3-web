### Description

I try to make HTTPS connection through Proxy with Zend\_Http\_Client and Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy. but always get expection "Unable to read response, or response is empty". Proxy has been verified no problem. After some debugging, I found that the only message returned from the proxy is "Connection: close".

p.s. make direct HTTPS connection works fine with Zend\_Http\_Client.

Hi,

Is this proxy open? Can you pass some example code and if possible the address of a proxy I can test on?

TIA,

here are some code you can take a look. the proxy used is Tor, I donot have a open to public proxy server , but you can easily install Tor on almost any platform.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Http/Client.php';
    require_once('Zend/Http/CookieJar.php');
    require_once 'Zend/Db.php';
    
    session_start();
    
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setConfig(
        array(
        'maxredirects'      => 5,
        'useragent'          => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1;
    en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3',
        'timeout'           => 30,
        'keepalive'      => true,
        'adapter'    => 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Proxy',
        //'ssltransport' => 'ssl',
        'proxy_host' => 'localhost',
        'proxy_port' => 8118,
        )
    );
    
    $client->setUri('<a href="https://www.apache-ssl.org">https://www.apache-ssl.org</a>');
    try {
       $response = $client->request();
    } catch (Zend_Http_Client_Exception $ex) {
       // Report the exception to the user
       die('Client Excep'.$ex->getMessage());
    } catch (Zend_Http_Exception $ex) {
        die('Http Excep'. $ex->getMessage());
    }
    echo $response->getBody();
    
    ?>

Hi,

I've done some research and I believe that in order to properly support tunneling of HTTPS connections, we need to properly implement the CONNECT method in the client.

This is a big change and thus cannot be applied on the main branch before 1.0 is released. Also, it would require some time to work on.

I will do my best to look into this, but I am not sure this will be supported soon.

OK then, thanks

Changed to 'new feature' - add proper support for HTTP CONNECT requests

Support was added in one of the latest revisions and should be available in SVN HEAD. I am still waiting for feedback (got none) to see if it properly works or not.

I have tested the ZF latest revision. It did not work, I'm getting following errors

Warning: stream\_socket\_enable\_crypto() [streams.crypto]: this stream does not support SSL/crypto in /Applications/Zend/ZendStudio-5.5.0/bin/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Proxy.php on line 194

above my last comment, the problem was because of I did not have openssl installed.

It works now!!!

Thanks!!!

No complaints yet - seems to be relatively well implemented. If any bugs appear they should be opened as new issues.
