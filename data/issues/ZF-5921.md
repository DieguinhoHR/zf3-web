### Description

Zend\_Uri\_Http does not allow special characters like umlauts and such in the path, query or fragment, while those are valid. As Zend\_Http\_Client and other classes uses Zend\_Uri directly, this makes it impossible to access those URLs. Currently the only way to work around this is to subclass Zend\_Uri and all classes which utilize it. Tho this makes it really hard to upgrade to a new version of the framework.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $url = '<a href="http://www.example.com/special-chars/%C3%BC">http://www.example.com/special-chars/ü</a>';
    var_dump(Zend_Uri::check($url)); // false
    
    $url = '<a href="http://www.example.com/?specialChars=%C3%BC">http://www.example.com/?specialChars=ü</a>';
    var_dump(Zend_Uri::check($url)); // false
    
    $url = '<a href="http://www.example.com/#%C3%BC">http://www.example.com/#ü</a>';
    var_dump(Zend_Uri::check($url)); // false

the URI RFC (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>) clearly does not allow such characters in an unescaped form in a URL (and specifically not in the path segment).

We can add some "magic" in Zend\_Uri that auto-escapes such things - but then how will you know not to escape characters such as '?' and '/'?

Well browsers like Firefox and so all know how and what to escape, and still display the unescaped URIs to the user. The user will always expect those URIs to workj in his applications where he enters them as well, so yeah, we should introduce some magic there then.

Browsers are also supposed to work for noobs. ZF is for developers (though they're not mutually exclusive :'( ).

Changing the issue type as it is obviously not a bug, but a feature request (at least that's what it has become).

Sure Dolf, but by telling this, you would force any developer to do the magic by himself, which simply cannot be right.
