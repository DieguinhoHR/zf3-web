ZF-3163: Cannot specify accountCanonicalForm = 1 from an ini file
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-04-22T17:03:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-07-17T22:02:39.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using an ini file to configure a Zend\_Ldap instance, setting accountCanonicalForm throws the following exception: "Unknown canonical name form: 1"

This is because the value returned from Zend\_Config\_Ini is a string and line 388 of Ldap.php, the value is strictly compared to an integer. This can also be an issue when $form is not specified, since $form = $this->\_getAccountCanonicalForm(); isn't done until line 401 (after the previous check has already been made). Other values of accountCanonicalForm seem unaffected, since they are non-strictly compared in the following switch statement.

Fixed in r10171.

Zend\_Ldap will now correctly interpret a string '1' as an integer 1.

However, note that trying to use a usernameCanonicalForm = 1 is currently not supported by Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap. Username canonical form 1 is a DN. It is highly unlikely that anyone would want to canonicalize usernames to DNs.
