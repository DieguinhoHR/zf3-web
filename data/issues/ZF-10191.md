ZF-10191: Zend\_Soap\_Client has problem encoding a certain string
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When passing a certain string "yw202" to a member function of a Zend\_Soap\_Client, it throws this exception: SOAP-ERROR: Encoding: string '\\xff...' is not a valid utf-8 string

"yw202" is a room code. It's passed to a soap server that returns data about that room. It was very difficult to track. When I finally tried to use the string directly in the call to the function:

$this->client->getRoomno("yw202");

I began to think this is a bug in the Zend\_Soap\_Client code. I'm guessing "yw202" represents some other character in another encoding?

I think I may have jumped the gun on this one. Will report back soon. For now ignore it.

Yes, definitely not an issue. This can be closed.
