ZF-3976: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action should give option to bypass the current request parameters

### Description

In the views <?= $this->action() ?> is usually used to call page related controls. The helper dose not give an option to merge or bypass the current request user parameters by force set them to null, Why?

public function resetObjects(array $newParams) { $params = $this->request->getUserParams(); foreach ($newParams as $key => $value) { $this->request->setParam($key, $value); }

public function action($action, $controller, $module = null, array $params = array() , $merge = false)

and one more parameter to the action function to merge the user request parameters with the give parameters. The current code is require set variable from the view control and if this in a layout view like my layout, it will be a nightmare :)

Thanks.
