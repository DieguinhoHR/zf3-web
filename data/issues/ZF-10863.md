### Description

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db is not final, so I expected that it could be extended. I am providing a custom ORM in the constructor($\_db) and then extending from Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db to implement a custom \_write().

The problem is when overriding the protected function \_write(), access to the $\_db, $\_table, and $\_columnMap is restricted since those variables are declared as private in Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db. This prevents you from effectively extending Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db.

It seems like the visibility of those variables should be protected. If we aren't to extend this class, then declare Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db as final.

I agree that we should not use the private visibility as much as possible. The protected visibility will be or has been implemented for ZF2. I'm going to do with Matthew if we can add the final class like for Zend\_Version.

But, I see no reason to extend the db writer to use a custom ORM. Why? You can't use the factory() method with the late state binding in PHP 5.2, and you rewrite the \_write() method. You just need to write your own writer, which extends Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Abstract.

Fixed in [pull 151](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/151).
