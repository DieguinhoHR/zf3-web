View scripts are not intended to be accessed directly via the browser; they are to be consumed by Zend\_View, at which time they run within an instance of Zend\_View and $this is populated. Follow the instructions in the quick start, and setup a virtual host pointing to the application's "public" directory, and then access <http://yourhostname/guestbook> -- which will then display the correct output.
