### Description

Alot PHP installations go with an variable\_order of "GPC". "E" is often no longer part of it. Also suhosin patches clear up the $\_ENV environmental variable by a good amount. In those cases, $\_ENV['MAGIC'] will not be available, even while getenv('MAGIC') would return the correct value.

Therefor I would advise to use getenv instead of $\_ENV within the getMagicFile method of the Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType class
