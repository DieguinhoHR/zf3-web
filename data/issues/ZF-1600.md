### Description

Strict Error in Zend\_Validate\_Abstract class on line 93 (Only variables should be passed by reference)

My code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="http://xmlsearch.yandex.ru/xmlsearch">http://xmlsearch.yandex.ru/xmlsearch</a>', array('maxredirects' => 0, 'timeout' => 30));
    $response = $client->request('POST');
    
    if ($response->getStatus() == 200) {
      echo $response->getBody();
    } else {
      echo $response->getStatus() . ": " . $response->getMessage();
    }

I cannot reproduce this error. Can you give any other information like your PHP version, operating system, or the error reporting mode in effect?

I am using PHP 5.2.3, Windows XP, and I have Xdebug 2.0.0.

I am using PHP 5.2.3, Mac OS X 10.4.10

How can i see this issue has resolved in revision 5395. Thanks.

Any of the following ways can get the changed file for you:

1. If you access the latest code for Zend Framework by using subversion, you can update to revision 5395 or later.
2. You can download the nightly snapshot, which is produced from subversion: <http://framework.zend.com/download/snapshot> Last night's snapshot was based on revision 5401, so it should include the change.
3. You can also download just the single file that was changed, and temporarily copy it into your ZF library. [http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/~raw,r=5395/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Validate/Abstract.php)

Thanks Alexey for locating the errors. It is strange because I cannot reproduce the errors. I enabled error\_reporting(E\_ALL|E\_STRICT) but I cannot see the errors. Perhaps it is because of xdebug.

In any case, I have done a grep for all occurrences of current() in the code, and I have verified that in all cases they are used on real variable references and not expressions.
