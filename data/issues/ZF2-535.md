### Description

Using a configuration array to wire up a global logger is currently obtuse. Writers construct signatures vary too much to be practical. Here's what I want to do in my autoload/global.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
        'logger' => array(
            'writers' => array(
                'Stream' => array(
                    'streamOrUrl' => 'log/application.log',
                ),
            ),
        ),
    );


Now, I can write a custom Factory just for that Writer. But, as soon as I try to make it generic for any writer, I run into signature hell. I haven't even begun to try to config filters or formatters.

See: [http://logging.apache.org/log4php/docs/…](http://logging.apache.org/log4php/docs/configuration.html)

Also, regarding the tutorial project: Who starts any project without logging? Only amateurs.

What is your problem exactly? Can you add the actual config to compare with the expected config?

I don't see something different in log4php, if you take two appenders like File and PDO: you need to define dsn for PDO, and file for File.

Where is an example of the current recommended service manager config for a global logger with multiple writers? If you can provide a clean example, then this issue can be closed.
