### Description

According to page 148 of the Zend Framework Certification Study guide (MVC section), "User-defined routes are added by calling addRoute() and passing a new instance of a class implementing Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface."

This conflicts with the "Basic Rewrite Router operation" section of the Zend Framework Reference Guide, which states in accordance with the API docs that "Routes are added by calling the addRoute method of RewriteRouter and passing in a new instance of a class implementing Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface." (Note the "\_Route" segment not present in the interface name cited in the study guide.)

I'm closing this since ZF Cert Study Guide issues aren't tracked here, but I've forwarded this report to the author for correction. Thanks! ,Wil
