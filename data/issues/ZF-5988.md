### Description

The Zend\_Dojo documentation could be improved in the following ways:

1 - The introduction should at a minimum reference the dojo view helpers provided to get dojo included in an application.

 
    The introduction should ideally explain which sections of the documentation to refer to for what purposes, ie something like:
       To add dojo to an application using Zend_Views,: see Dojo View helpers.
       To enhance forms and form elements using Dojo/Dijit (see 15.4. Dojo Form Elements and Decorators)
       To provide dynamic data to dojo in ajax style applications see Dojo Data.
    
      (I think it's confusing that the first section is on dojo data, which I think should have been the last section.)


2 - The view helper section, should have a small discussion on getting dojo from a CDN vs. locally. Currently it's spread throughout the view section. Additionally there should be a mention of what's needed to use dojo from a cdn but still have local modules. See also ZF-5986, the documentation for useCDN() is incorrect. It is probably also worth mentioning that setCdnXxx() and setLocalPath() are mutually exclusive.

3 - The view helper section should mention what actions cause dojo to be implicitly enabled. Such as setLocalPath, setCdnVersion, Also: rendering a dojo enabled form will implicitly enable dojo.

Thanks, --Rob

Updated description, a few more suggestions for improving the docs. Mentioned ZF-5986, which is partially documentation related, not sure if I should also link to that.
