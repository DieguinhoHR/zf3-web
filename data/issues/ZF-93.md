### Description

Due to the fact, that creating an index and doing a commit at the end, is not working due to exaust of memory, I am commiting the index after each first word letter, so I have now a folder containing \_0.cfs to \_z.cfs & deletable & segments.

Now trying to do a search is always returning no result. a print\_r of the Zend\_Search\_Lucene object returns certain stuff, which assumes that it is only using the first (\_0.cfs) file:

[\_fileHandlers:private] => Array

(

[segments] => Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_File\_Filesystem Object

(

[\_fileHandle:private] => Resource id #56

)

[\_0.cfs] => Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Storage\_File\_Filesystem Object

(

[\_fileHandle:private] => Resource id #57

)

)

[\_segFiles:private] => Array

(

[\_0.fdx] => 106 [\_0.fdt] => 130 [\_0.fnm] => 618 [\_0.tis] => 742 [\_0.tii] => 1689 [\_0.frq] => 1717 [\_0.prx] => 1838

)

Trying to open the index with the Luke Java Application reports "No sub-file with id \_0.f2 found". But trying to open an index directory which works (with a single commit) reports the error : "No sub-file with id \_0.f1" found.

This index is working and there are the following files in it: \_0.cfs deletable segments

It's the same problem as ZF-91.

Index has several segments, but only first is listed in a 'segments' file
