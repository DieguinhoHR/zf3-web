yes, I know that h1 not closed, but with closed h1 alert works too. And does it possible autoclose this h1?

Fixed in r21550 and r21551 (merged into 1.10 release branch).

And can you do me a pleasure next time: Make the usecase just the most simple code possible, just "[h1][/h1]" as input is enough in this case. I don't need the rest of your input for this ;).

Thank for fast fix.

Ok, will report shorter parts of code next time. But this "big" part of code pasted because issue has 2 parts: _xss_ and _parsing of incorrect tags_

What about autoclosing of non-closed tags? Can you make it? Or maybe just ignore non-closed tags. As you see in my output - all text below second h1 hasn't rendered correctly.

There are library XBB <http://xbb.uz/docs/> (only russian language). In XBB input "[b][i]foo bar[/b][/i]" will be represented by parser as "[b][i]foo bar[/i][/b][/i]" and parsed as "**_foo bar_**"****

Please open separate issues then ;). Its much easier to manage two separate issues than one big one that gathers a lot of issues.
