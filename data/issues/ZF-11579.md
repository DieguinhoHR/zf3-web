### Description

ZA\_Resource\_View creates itself a ViewRenderer and registers it in the HelperBroker stack. It should not create the ViewRenderer, but instead, rely on HelperBroker to lazy-load it.

When back-adding the created ViewRenderer into HelperBroker, it is created with a wrong name into the HelperBroker stack. Then, if ZA\_Resource\_View gets loaded _after_ a plugin that did play with the ViewRenderer, we got two ViewRenderer objects in memory.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // diff
    public function init()
        {
            $view = $this->getView();
    
    -       $viewRenderer = new Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_ViewRenderer();
    +       $viewRenderer = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('viewRenderer');
            $viewRenderer->setView($view);
    -       Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::addHelper($viewRenderer);
            return $view;
        }

Added a test for this, and applied the patch in trunk and the 1.11 release branch. Thanks!
