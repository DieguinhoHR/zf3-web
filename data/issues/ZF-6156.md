### Description

the new $\_minPrefixLength functionality added in to fix ZF-3321 may break many peoples searches with the default set to 3, I would think this should be changed to 0.

using :

$searchIndex = Zend\_Search\_Lucene::open($config->datafiles->directory . 'search-index'); Zend\_Search\_Lucene::setDefaultSearchField('title'); $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Word\_SeparatorToSeparator(' ','\* _'); $searchCriteria = $filter->filter($searchCriteria); $query = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse('_'.$searchCriteria.'\*'); $searchResults = $searchIndex->find($query, 'title', SORT\_STRING);

after upgrading to 1.7.7 all my search returned was "At least 3 non-wildcard terms are required." regardless of what anyone was searching for.

I had to add the following in above the call to the QueryParser to fix this issue:

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Wildcard::setMinPrefixLength(0);

The lack of documentation for this new functionality certainly didn't help

Setting it to 0 by default allows things like searches for \* AND \* AND \* (and longer) which allows each user to easily let the script run for a long time and consume lots of memory until memory\_limit or max\_execution\_time is reached.

I think security here should come first to not allow those things if the user not explicitly wants it.

This behavior is documented now.
