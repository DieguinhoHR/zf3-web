ZF-9441: Zend\_Validate\_StringLength doesn't reset errors and messages if null is passed in as value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The $this->\_errors and $this->\_messages is normally reset when isValid() is invoked (actually Zend\_Validate\_Abstract::\_setValue does the reset).

In Zend\_Validate\_StringLength, the isValid() checks for is\_string before it does a \_setValue.

This means if it is not re-instantiated it will keep the $this->\_messages and $this->\_errors from the previous validation.

Fix: Move \_setValue() in Zend\_Validate\_StringLength to the first line of Zend\_Validate\_StringLength::isValid()

public function isValid($value) { $this->\_setValue($value);

 
        if (!is_string($value)) {
            $this->_error(self::INVALID);
            return false;
        }

Moving \_setValue "before" the validation (which looks if the given value has the correct type, would add new problems when a false type is given.

According to API doc from StringLength only "string" is allowed as type. A "NULL" is no string, so from this point the behaviour is correct.
