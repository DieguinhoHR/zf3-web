public function addTypes($types) { if ($types instanceof DomDocument) { $dom = $this->dom->importNode($types->documentElement, true); $this->wsdl->appendChild($dom); } elseif ($types instanceof DomNode || $types instanceof DomElement || $types instanceof DomDocumentFragment ) { $dom = $this->dom->importNode($types, true); $this->wsdl->appendChild($dom); } }

Here is the fix.

I'm familiar with this issue, so I thought I'd clarify a little bit.

The AddTypes method in the Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl appears to have a bug/typo where it imports the types element, but then doesn't bother to use it. Marcus's fix addresses that error and also fixes the problem where the import doesn't get the hierarchy of types.

It appears that in it's current state Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl is unusable with custom types.

Fixed.
