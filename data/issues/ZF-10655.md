### Description

Lets say you have a translation like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    return array(
        // Navigation strings.
        'Dashboard' => 'Übersicht',
        'Menus'  => 'Menüs',
        'Pages' => 'Seiten',
        'Extensions' => 'Erweiterungen',
        'Help' => 'Hilfe',
        'Users' => 'Benutzer',
    
        // Router key translations.
        'admin' => 'Administration',
        'default' => 'Standard',
        'menu' => 'Menü',
        'media' => 'Medien',
        'pages' => 'Seiten',
        'extensions' => 'Erweiterungen',
        'help' => 'Hilfe',
        'user' => 'Benutzer',
    );


The problem here is 'Benutzer', because in German singular and plural is the same for this word. Now create the navigation with the following page:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
            'label'      => 'Users',
            'module'     => 'admin',
            'controller' => 'user',
            'action'     => 'index',
            'route'      => 'default',
            'resource'   => 'res:admin.user.index',
        ),


This will result in: Invalid controller specified (Users)

Changing the order of 'Navigation strings' and 'Router key translations' will work for now but this can't be a real solution.

Can you please provide a unit test, or at the minimum, the exact code, expected result, and actual result you receive? I'm really unsure how to reproduce this, as I'm not sure what the expectations are.

Can you explain "router key translation"? What is it or what do you mean. Please provide also your route definition. Thanks.

I ran a few tests, but I do not know the route definition. And what is a "router key translation"?

Hi,

sorry for my late answer :)

The problem was, that "Benutzer" will be translated to "Users" instead of "user". "user" is the module name which will translate like: - domain.tld/de/Benutzer/Name1 - domain.tld/en/user/Name1

So "router key translation" was ment to be one of the following: name of a module, a controller or an action name.

"Navigation strings" are strings used within Zend\_Navigation label's.

The main problem now is, that "Benutzer" is singular and plural at once in Germany.

I don't know if this problem exists not anymore. And i also don't know how to write a unit test in this case. :)
