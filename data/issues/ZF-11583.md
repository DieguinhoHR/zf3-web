ZF-11583: Zend\_Cache\_Backend::getTmpDir() fails when $\_SERVER['TMP'] is set to false

### Description

While I was installing ZF on a new server I noticed, that Zend\_Cache\_Backend::getTmpDir() returns document root instead of temp directory. The reason was that the server set $\_SERVER['TMP'] as a false value and the code in getTmpDir() checks it only via isset(). I would therefore recommend checking also the value.
