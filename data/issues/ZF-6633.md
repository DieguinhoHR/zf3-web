ZF-6633: How about classifing the issues by DB kind than class name?

### Description

I will be happy if Zend\_Db issues are classified by DB Kind.

Now I feel hard to search issue that depends on specified DB.

For example, If I must search the DB2 issues, I should look over Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2 , db2 issues in Zend\_Db\_Table, and the same in Zend\_Db.. and so on.

I hope we become to be able to group by Zend\_Db(Db2), Zend\_Db(Oracle), Zend\_Db(Mysql) , Zend\_Db(Common), Zend\_Db(another DB) etc...

Or we should use the "Tags" to sort by DB product name?

With King Regards.

Now I close this issue because my report might cause some inconsistence against how to assign another components.
