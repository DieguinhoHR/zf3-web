I'll try to roll this into the layout classes I've been working on. There are some new geometry classes (such as Zend\_Pdf\_Rect) that should make such a feature easier to implement.

Hi Willie, with this new features can we will use "tag-formatted" text and circular text?? Do you implements bookmarks and protection functions? Thanks

The first revisions will not support tagged text. The API works by assigning attributes to character ranges. However, some type of tagging support (perhaps a subset of HTML) is on my long-term list.

I'm not sure what you mean by circular text. Can you give an example?

Bookmark support is currently missing, and I realized that there was no issue for it. You can track the progress of bookmark support now in ZF-314. For encryption (protection) functions, refer to ZF-13.

Here a circular text example (<http://www.fpdf.org/en/script/script82.php>). But.. with an image (like in the Zend\_Pdf demo) the result is better. What do you think?

I'm watching bookmarks and encryption issues now!

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Unassigning Zend\_Pdf issues currently assigned to me pending decision on ZF 2.0 release timeframe and potential contribution of comprehensive changeset.

Attached is a patch that includes the code, documentation, and modified unit tests for rectangles with rounded corners. It is implemented differently than fpdf, but provides the same functionality. In the unit tests, I also made the regular rectangle and line bigger to accommodate the new rounded rectangle.

Patch is applied
