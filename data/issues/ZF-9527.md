ZF-9527: When Using ZendStudio locally; the browser doesn't always show any html

### Description

ZendFramework 1.10.1, ZendStudio (7.1.2), ZendServer ce (5.3), CentOS 5.4 - as this may be very specific.

When debugging pages, the ZendStudio Debug Output pane shows the html that sometimes is sent to the browser. In the file Zend/Controller/Response/Abstract.php, function outputBody(), adding a flush() call after 'echo $body;' fixes this problem.

I believe this issue has since been fixed in Zend Studio?
