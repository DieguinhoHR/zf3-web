ZF-5283: Make static routes case-insensitive
--------------------------------------------

### Description

It would be nice if static routes matched in a case-insensitive way. I think about, About, and ABOUT should all route to aboutAction().

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function match($path)
    {
        if (trim($path, '/') == $this->_route) {
            return $this->_defaults;
        }
        return false;
    }


becomes

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function match($path)
    {
        if (strcasecmp(trim($path, '/'), $this->_route) == 0) {
            return $this->_defaults;
        }
        return false;
    }

I think this is actually an issue with the dispatcher, for instance FC calls getControllerClass() method of dispatcher, this method checks \_controllerDirectory array, which is indexed in a case sensitive manner, so if you pass in lowercase it will not match. I believe you would need to subclass methods like this to work around the issue, only then could you subclass the router to cast strings to lowercase. Hope this helps.

Actually the best way to do this would be to probably override the request object, not the dispatcher or the router. The router is already case insensitive, overriding dispatcher would work but would require overridng more code and overriding the request object would be more semantic anyways. I'm going to override getModuleName() to inflect it's return value. ( meaning even if I pass lower first module name in request URI, the dispatcher should be hitting a ucfirst() directory name. To me this should be a pretty easy fix and it could be left optional... It should not be difficult to override but in order for the Zend team to include this fix they'd have to account for different dispatching paradigms, it'd be interesting to see this in an upcoming release for sure.

Alright, sorry for the tri-post, here's the patch tho:

class Ne8\_Controller\_Request extends Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http { /\*\* \* Retrieve the module name \* \* @return string \*/ public function getModuleName() { if (null === $this->\_module) { $this->\_module = $this->getParam($this->getModuleKey()); }

 
        return ucfirst( strtolower( $this->_module ) );
    }


}

Then in your bootstrap you need to call ->setDefaultModule( 'Default' ) on the FC, since we're forcing all directories into a naming convention.

I don't see this as a nice feature at all - it would allow for a lot of duplicate content. For example Google processes URLs in case-sensitive way, if I'm not mistaken.

Perhaps it can be an option?

If the functionality can be optional, I see no problem with applying such a patch -- as long as there is a note in the manual indicating that it may affect SEO.
