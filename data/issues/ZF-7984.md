ZF-7984: Sub-second timeouts are not supported
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-09-30T05:53:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:10.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Sub one second timeouts are not supported, even in the case where the underlying adapter supports them.

For example, the stream\_set\_timeout() in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket's connect() method is called with:

 
    stream_set_timeout($this->socket, (int) $this->config['timeout'])


Hence, the timeout value is cast to an integer even though stream\_set\_timeout itself supports sub-second timeouts with the $microseconds argument.
