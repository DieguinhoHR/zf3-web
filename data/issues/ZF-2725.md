### Description

snapshot : ZendFramework-20080220-8205

I ve implemented a Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Interface class to build my feeds.

in getEntries() i loop with new Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Entry($title, $url, $description);

I had to htmlentities escape $title, $url and $description... ok so far.

But if i put some & in $url it's ok in rss but it's double escaped in atom...

rss: ... [http://beta.nicematin.com/ra/26/…](http://beta.nicematin.com/ra/26/120060?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&xtor=RSS-120&amp); ...

atom:

... ...

And If I do not escape I get some createElement warnings in rss :

Warning: DOMDocument::createElement() : unterminated entity reference utm\_medium=feed&xtor=RSS-120& in /prod/htroot/Zend/ZendFramework-20080220-8205/library/Zend/Feed/Rss.php on line 387

it s a shame if i have to code 2 feed builders....

best regards

Unable to reproduce. This doesn't invalidate the bug, however it's likely it was fixed in a previous version.
