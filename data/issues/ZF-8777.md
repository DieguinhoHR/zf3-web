### Description

when we test the avaibility of a Zend\_Locale instance, the test is done on zend\_locale ::to\_string instead of zend\_locale::getlanguage

And what's the problem with this way? getLanguage() does only return the language and not the locale.

Zend\_Translate on the other side allows also to do regionbased translations.... wordings from one region are not always equal to another region using the same language. Using getLanguage() would not work in such a case.

Please give us a reproducable usecase which shows what exactly your problem is

In the application I initialize Zend\_translate with the 'en' string as locale then I test if the Zend\_Locale('auto') is available.

if(Zend\_Translate::isAvailable(Zend\_Locale('auto')){ Zend\_Translate::setLocale(Zend\_Locale('auto)); }

If in the http header the value of Accept Language is something like fr\_FR, Zend\_Translate::isAvailable returns false while for fr it returns true. In fact Zend\_Tranlate works fine in the two cases, if the locale isn't translatable it search translation for the regional part of the locale, so it seems logical that isAvailable returns true for all case where Zend\_Translate is working fine.

p.s. : I know that I have a very uggly english so if you want some clarifications please let me know.

Sorry, but I don't get the point...

"auto" is ALWAYS available... when your user does not provide one, your systems locale will be used as "auto"-value.

Something like isAvailable('auto') is useless and will not work in such a situation (in my eyes) as "auto" is no locale at all. You can use it at initiation, but not when you request a locale.

isAvailable() returns true when you have translations for fr, your user sets fr\_FR and you allow degradation.

Another note: Release 1.8 is no longer supported except for security problems.

It could be that your problem is already fixed within the actual release or the new upcoming release 1.10.

You should test one of these to see it that is the case. And you should beware to use the actual online manual for the release you are using. Actual release is 1.9.7. It adds some features which are not available within your release.

I explain from the beginning. My browser send http request like with "Accept-Language fr-fr,fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3" If I in my application I have : Zend\_Translate(Zend\_Locale('auto')); The Zend\_Translate uses my french translation file ( fr.mo ), it search fr\_FR.po then fr.po

So I think Zend\_Translate(Zend\_locale('fr\_FR')) would return true to have the approach in isAvailable and in setLocale methods. isAvailable would be more like that : public function isAvailable($locale) { $return = isset($this->_translate[(string) $locale]); if(!$return){ $temp = explode('_',$locale); $return = isset($this->\_translate[(string) $temp[0]); } return $return; }

p.s. : I just download the 1.9.7 release the issue exists ever

As described before isAvailable() returns only SET translations.

And as also described before Zend\_Translate itself must allow to return regional translations.

This means in detail that you could have: de => "Auto" de\_AT => "Karre" de\_DE => "Automobil" de\_CH => "Vehikel"

So far so good. What ever language your user requests he get's his dialect.

Related to isAvailable returning ONLY language and not region is \* errorous and \* problematic

Think of a translation which provides only de\_AT => "Karre" de\_DE => "Automobil"

The user requests "de"... and your change would force isAvailable to return true... but there is no translation at all. So this approach would not work.

This is the reason why, as described before, you must give the proper locale... when you are not able to do so (because you are working with uncommon locale abbreviations) simply use Zend\_Locale to get the correct locale.

This means: $locale = new Zend\_Locale($mystring);

isAvailable() itself supports also to use a locale instance.

For your case this means: \* There is no official locale "auto", therefor null is returned when requested \* The Zend\_Locale-internal locale "auto" is converted by Zend\_Locale to the wished locale

Related to your issue using "getLanguage" instead of "toString" this does mean: "No... this is not a bug, but wished and expected behaviour"

Related to your other request that isAvailable() should return true on "fr\_FR" by using "fr" is available also a NO.

When there is no fallback it would return NO as described before even if I would expect YES.

Closing as won't fix.

Disallowing regional translation will not be done.
