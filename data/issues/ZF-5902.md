### Description

I have a similar problem which causes Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script '.phtml' not found in path.

It's related with url rewriting.

Ia have actions in my IndexController: class IndexController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action {

 
    public function indexAction() { $this->view->myVar = 'Hello world';}
    
    public function pageAction(){$this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender(true);}


}

Now when I go in url: <http://localhost/index/page> - everything goes fine, but when I ad this to my bootstrap file: $frontController->getRouter()->addRoute('pages', new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('page/:urlrewrite/\*', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'page')));

and now I go on: <http://localhost/page> - I get this fatal error. After some debugging I have found, that content is well rendered (renders nothing) but there is some next step, which throw this error: on postDispatch> plugin Zend\_Layout\_Controller\_Plugin\_Layout: try { $fullContent = $layout->render(); } - it is because $name is null;

I have found a solution, it was my fault:

I had Plugin which set layout template by module name. But it was done on routeShutDown. When I have switched it on postDispatch, everything goes as expected.
