### Description

Hello.

We're using the PluginLoader cache in a high-frequented website. Therefore our deployment system deletes the cache file on every deployment run, when plugin files got deleted or moved. Now we ran into the problem that the cache was re-created incomplete. The opening <?php tag was missing in the file.

We could track this problem to the \_appendIncFile method in Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader. protected static function \_appendIncFile($incFile) { if (!file\_exists(self::$\_includeFileCache)) { $file = '<?php'; } else { $file = file\_get\_contents(self::$\_includeFileCache); } if (!strstr($file, $incFile)) { $file .= "\\ninclude\_once '$incFile';"; file\_put\_contents(self::$\_includeFileCache, $file); } }

Following scenario happens: - The PHP process works on the first if condition and finds the still existing cache file. => Jumps to else block. - A new deployment is simultaneous started, which has to delete the cache file (plugin files were moved or deleted). This happens in the time after the PHP process calls the file\_exists and tries in the next step a file\_get\_contents. - The PHP process now tries to get the file with file\_get\_contents. Because the file is missing $file gets the value false. - Adding the next include\_once to the variable and calling file\_put\_contents ends up in a cache file without an starting <?php tag. => Our website stops working, because this non php file gets included on every call producing unwanted output.

We're not sure if this is a bug of the \_appendIncFile or it's just wrong to delete the cache file and there's another option to clean it up and start his recreation.

We think this could be fixed, when the file\_get\_contents is directly called (before any file\_exists). If the returned value is false the string should get a <?php tag assigned as string value.

You're right, a warning will be raised, not ideal. But this also also currently the case when our described scenario happens.
