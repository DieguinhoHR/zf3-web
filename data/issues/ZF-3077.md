### Description

The unit test suite for Zend\_Service\_Simpy should have the capability to run offline. Typically this involves capturing responses from the service provider to files and adding these files to SVN for use with the test suite. See other test suites for more specifics on how this can be done.

Alex, please evaluate and decide whether we should fix this. If it is worth fixing, please contact the author of Simpy to see if she/he will fix it.

I'm working on separating the test suite out into both online and offline versions. I've run into an issue with Simpy itself that prevents some tests from running reliably and contacted its maintainer but as of yet have received no response. Copies of the communications are included below.

Hey Otis,

I'm having an issue deleting links on Simpy, both from the web interface and through the API. If you look under the syapizend account, you should see a single bookmark for <http://framework.zend.com>. Attempts to delete this link from the web interface appear to work as normal up to the point where the page refreshes, when the link is still shown despite the deletion attempt. The API returns the response shown below, also appearing to indicate that all is well, but a subsequent call to GetLinks shows the link to still be present. Any ideas on what could be causing this issue? Thanks in advance for your help.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> `0` Link deleted successfully.

Regards,

Hey Otis,

Another issue that came up after I'd already sent the previous e-mail: when I attempt to edit this link, I get the following.

Who Stole my Mojo!? (read: ooops, something broke) An error has occurred. This may be a temporary error. Please go back and try again. If the error persists, please let us know.

Perhaps this is an issue with the search index being out of sync with data storage? Please keep me apprised of what you find out.

Thanks,

Hi,

All clear now - your account's underlying bookmark index needed reindexing, that's all. Note that I replied to you.... I think it was over IM, so maybe you didn't get my message.
