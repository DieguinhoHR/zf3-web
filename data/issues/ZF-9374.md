### Description

When anonymous parameters are passed in, and one or more optional parameters are missing, the default values are not correctly filled in, and the call fails with a 'missing arguments' error message.

There was already a unit test for this functionality, but the expected value was incorrectly hard-coded backwards, so the failure was counting as a pass.

Attached patch fixes Zend\_Rest\_Server, and accompanying unit tests.

'sorry.. original diff had a misleading/incorrect comment. This is the correct diff.

I agree with _Jonathan Csanyi_.

I ran into that problem an thought Zend\_Rest\_Client was the cause as it uses the "arg1" query parameter name when only one argument is passed to the server (see ZF-4910). But is seems that Zend\_Rest\_Server is guilty.

With the following server PHP code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyServerImpl
    {
      public function myMethod ($var)
      {
        $return $var*$var;
      }
      public function myOtherMethod ($var = 3)
      {
        $return $var*$var;
      }
    }
    $server = new Zend_Rest_Server();
    $server->setClass('MyServerImpl');
    $server->handle();


The following client PHP code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client
      ->myMethod(5)
      ->get();


Issues the following request: server.php?method=_myMethod_&_myMethod_=5&arg1=_5_

Which is handled by Zend\_Rest\_Server::handle() as

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $missing_args[0] = 'var';
    $calling_args[1] = 5
    => myMethod(5);


{color:green}Which is correct.{color}

And the other following client PHP code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client
      ->myOtherMethod(5)
      ->get();


Issues the following request: server.php?method=_myOtherMethod_&_myOtherMethod_=5&arg1=_5_

Which is handled by Zend\_Rest\_Server::handle() as

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $missing_args[] = array();
    $calling_args[0] = 3;
    $calling_args[1] = 5;
    => myOtherMethod(3);


{color:red}Which is incorrect.{color}

The solution would be to either use 0-based array everywhere, or the given "library/Zend/Rest/Server.php" DIFF file [^trunk-correct.diff].
