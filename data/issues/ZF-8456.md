### Description

The documentation for Zend\_Feed\_Reader Attribute Collections uses the word "type" but, based on the code and usage of the component, I believe it should use the word "term":

bq. The container object will contain, per category, three fields of data: type, scheme and label.

I believe this is supposed to read:

bq. The container object will contain, per category, three fields of data: term, scheme and label.

Here is a patch for the English and German documentation which I believe are the only ones written for this feature.
