### Description

Actual FC (FrontController) stands like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = $this->getRouter();
    $router->setParams($this->getParams());
    
    // ...
    
     try {
                $this->_plugins->routeStartup($this->_request);
                $router->route($this->_request);
                // ....


As you can see, there is no way for a plugin listening on routeStartup() to alter the router in FrontController as it's already been set before.

We should find a way to allow that, like, for example, move the $router affectation just after the routeStartup routine
