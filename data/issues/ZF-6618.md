ZF-6618: Passing resource/resources through Zend\_Application bootstrap() wrapped method to the bootstrap() method of Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract

### Description

Right now if you only want to instantiate specific resources in the bootstrap, you're required to do this (after instantiating a Zend\_Application object):

$application->getBootstrap()->bootstrap('resource');

The following won't work:

$application->bootstrap('resource');

This is because the bootstrap() wrapper of Zend\_Application doesn't proxy the arguments to Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract.

I suggest that the the implementation of the bootstrap() method in Zend\_Application is changed so that doing this is possible.
