ZF-11879: Zend\_Locale\_Format precision incorrect
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-11-09T18:35:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-11-09T20:51:06.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

In Zend\_Locale\_Format the precision option seems to be broken for some locales. Here is an example in German:

echo Zend\_Locale\_Format::toNumber(53.3333333333333333333) returns 53,3333333333333333333

which is correct but

echo Zend\_Locale\_Format::toNumber(53.3333333333333333333, array('precision' => 1)) returns 533.333.333.333.330,0

which isn't even close.

This is seen on PHP 5.3.8 with BCMath enabled and ZF 1.11.11.

Drilling down a bit further it appears to be an interaction between PHP's setlocale() and ZF. Since we are in the process of migrating code from one to the other we are currently making use of both. It looks as if Zend\_Locale\_Format should be made aware of setlocale()'s settings.

After some team debugging the issue is the overuse of Zend\_Locale\_Math::normalize in toNumber. The first use is fine and handles the setlocale() case but then it is called over and over during the execution of toNumber. After the first call it strips the wrong decimal\_point/thousands\_sep and butchers the number resulting in the wrong output.
