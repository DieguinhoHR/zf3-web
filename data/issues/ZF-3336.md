### Description

Currently the format is inconsistent and carries unnecessary information (in addition to not being documented).

Suggested Improvement: - remove the called and method from the XML (they're known) - wrap any type of response in a root node - add the status as an attribute to the response Success: <response generator="zend" version="1.0" status="success'>

- For exceptions adding the type of exception would be helpful <response generator="zend" version="1.0" status="failed'> FooBarException

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary. I've already targeted a release, but please update if that schedule is not appropriate or realistic.
