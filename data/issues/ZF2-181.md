----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Json\_Server (ZF1) currently only allows errors in range(-32099, -32000). For ZFv2, the implementation should be changed to adhere to the spec: \* Error code can be any integer \* Codes in range(-32700,-32000) are reserved for protocol implementation

See: ZF-11991 for more information. Thanks to [~448191] for raising the ZFv1 issue.
