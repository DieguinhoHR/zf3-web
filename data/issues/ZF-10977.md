### Description

A very nice method for returning json content is to use the json ActionHelper:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function listAction()
    {
      return $this->_helper->json($dataArray);
    }


But using this method with data stored in some temporary cache requires the decoding and re-encoding of the information:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    function listAction()
    {
      return $this->_helper->json(json_decode(file_get_contents($cacheFile)));
    
      //or
    
      return $this->_helper->json(unserialize(file_get_contents($cacheFile)));
    }


It would be faster to just json encode the data in the cache and output them with a simple:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
      return $this->_helper->json(file_get_contents($cacheFile),array('jsonEncode'=>false));


It is quite easy to implement, as it requires only a couple of lines in Zend\_Json::encode():

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
            if (isset($options['jsonEncode']) && false === $options['jsonEncode']) {
                return $valueToEncode;
            }

I've attached a patch which implements the functionality you are looking for. As Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Json doesn't use a configuration array, the usage is slightly different:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return $this->_helper->json(file_get_contents($cacheFile), true, false, true);


Where $this->\_helper->json has the following method signuature:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Strategy pattern: call helper as helper broker method
     *
     * Allows encoding JSON. If $sendNow is true, immediately sends JSON
     * response.
     *
     * @param  mixed   $data
     * @param  boolean $sendNow
     * @param  boolean $keepLayouts
     * @param  boolean $dataIsJson Provided data is already JSON
     * @return string|void
     */
    public function direct($data, $sendNow = true, $keepLayouts = false, $dataIsJson = false)


The usage is a little clumsy, and I think that this action helper could be restructured to also allow setting configurations in the syntax you use in your example without breaking BC.

Thoughts?

I've reviewed the patch and confirm it operates as intended. Please ensure a matching unit test is included before committing.

Recommend committing to trunk (need to check with Matthew on adding to release branch as it adds to the API). Please ensure a ZF2 git pull request including matching changes is issued for ZF2 before resolving.

The patch works perfectly, but I do agree that the usage could be a little clumsy. If you are worried about that, a way to mantain BC could be to check if $sendNow is an array, and then parse it for the relevant parameters. Could that work?

Upon further review, I missed one thing: The original patch I suggested short-circuits the calling of Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json entirely, which means that the JSON headers never get set. I've attached an updated patch with unit tests which address this issue by extending the encoding enable/disable flag into Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json as well. There is also an updated manual page for Zend\_View\_Helper\_Json which explains how to disable encoding. I did not update the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Json manual page, as it needs a rewrite (see below).

The question of providing an array shortcut via $sendNow is related to ZF-11826. Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Json's manual page gives incorrect examples which show an array shortcut functionality that doesn't exist in that component. Whether we choose to add that feature, or simply change the manual page, it will be done under that issue #.

Fixed in trunk r24829. No forward-port to ZF2 as it does not have the JSON action helper anymore.
