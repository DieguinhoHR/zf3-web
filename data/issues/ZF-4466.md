ZF-4466: Zend\_Form::setName() has no effect

### Description

In my opinion the method Zend\_Form::setName() has no effect.

In the rendering code around Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form::form() I can't find any code about the form's attribute 'name' (only 'id' is there - and working in the right way).

May be there is the hope that 'name' is among the other attributes but I think that's not the case. Or this has no impact.

I suggest to handle the attribute 'name' like in other view helpers e.g. Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormText. There I can clearly see the 'name'.

setName() sets the name attribute, which is passed as the 'name' argument to the form() view helper. If the user does not specify an ID attribute, this value will be used as the ID for the form. (Look in the Form decorator for more details.)
