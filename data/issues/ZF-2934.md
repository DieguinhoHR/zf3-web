### Description

In Zend\_View\_Smarty, when using an array append operation (eg. $view->myArray[] = 'foo';) the \_\_get overload function produces this notice: Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property ...

To fix this you have to pass by reference - but the Zend\_View\_Interface/Zend\_View\_Abstract \_\_get method doesn't pass by reference so I fixed it like this:

change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __get($key)
        {
    
            return $this->_smarty->get_template_vars($key);
    
        }


to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __get($key)
        {
    
            return is_array($this->_smarty->get_template_vars($key)) ? new ArrayObject($this->_smarty->get_template_vars($key)) : $this->_smarty->get_template_vars($key);
    
        }


I'm sure there's some way to make this more pretty by using a temp var or something, but I wanted it to be fast and simple.

OK, this get's rid of the notice but it still doesn't work (it doesn't append to the array still). Any ideas how to make this work right?

This should work: First, make sure that Zend\_View\_Smarty doesn't extend Zend\_View\_Abstract and then change:

public function \_\_get($key)

to

public function &\_\_get($key)

By passing by reference you no longer have the issues with appending to array's etc. The ArrayObject method i tested above didn't work because Smarty wouldn't iterate over the ArrayObject like an array in my testing.

Fixing obviously incorrect fix for version (fix version < affects version).

Now, Zend\_View\_Interface has no \_\_get() function.

So, \_\_get() function should be removed from zend.view.scripts.html#zend.view.scripts.templates.interface .
