### Description

Looking trough the render function in the Zend\_Tag\_Cloud\_Decorator\_HtmlTag class, it is not possible, besides extending the class, to add further parameters to the tag link. It would be nice too have some option to add attributes to the link like title, rel, accesskey or tabindex.
