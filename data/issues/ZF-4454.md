### Description

It appears that if you use the supplied loginUser function from the ZF documentation you can run into an issue if you have to explicitly set a baseUrl in your front controller. Here is some example code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $frontController->setBaseUrl("/sites/mysite");


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function loginUser($user = self::_testUser , $password = self::_testPassword)
        {
            $request = $this->getRequest();
            $request->setMethod('POST')
                    ->setPost(array(
                        'username' => $user,
                        'password' => $password,
                    ));
            $this->dispatch('/auth/index/login');
            $this->assertQueryContentContains('h2','System News', "Unable to log in with $user/$password");
            $this->resetResponse();
            $request->setPost(array());
        }
    
        function testListAlbums()
        {
            $this->loginUser();
            $this->request->setMethod('GET');
            $this->dispatch('/albums/admin/list');
            $this->assertNotRedirect('Not authenticated');
            $this->assertQueryContentContains('a','Add a new Album');
        }


The behavior I am observing is that the first request (the login) works properly. The second request seems to be ignoring the baseUrl for some reason. I know this because if I set the dispatch and manually prepend the baseUrl the test works as expected. If I set the dispatch as shown in the example the test fails with Front Controller reporting "Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception: Invalid controller specified (error)"

First off, don't call resetResponse() unless you're actually dispatching another request within the same test method. There's no point otherwise, as each test sets up the environment from scratch.

Second, each test method runs separately, and gets bootstrapped individually -- that's what setUp() is for and what it does. What happens in one test method should not affect what happens in others -- unless there are static variables in play. Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Controller takes care of the various MVC singletons and global variables for you, but if there are any in your own code, you'll need to take care of those yourself.

Third, I need a better reproduce case. This particular one exhibits no issues for me.

In discussion with the reporter, the solution is to either: \* prepend all urls passed to dispatch() with the baseUrl being used \* don't use baseUrl in the first place In both cases, all works as expected.
