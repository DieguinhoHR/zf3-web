### Description

It is not possible to run a query link this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    It would be nice to have an extra param to specify limit: 

$db->delete($table, $where, $limit); $db->delete('table', 'name LIKE "b%"', 3);```

And the update method also lacks support of this.

You know other way to do this?, Adapters does not works.

You would also need an order clause so that you are deleting the correct 3.

Was surprised to discover this was lacking.

Have you made some progress? Will this be implemented some time?
