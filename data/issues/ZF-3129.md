ZF-3129: Automatic quoting for Zend\_Db\_Table::delete
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2008-04-17T10:26:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-19T06:11:32.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I was always very unhappy about how ugly quoting with Zend\_db is. See this "simple" delete for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myModel->delete(Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter()->quoteInto('foo = ?', $foo)
                     . ' AND '
                     . Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter()->quoteInto('bar = ?', $bar));


I have now written a patch which solves this problem. With this patch, this horrible long line can look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myModel->delete('foo = ? AND bar = ?', $foo, $bar);


Any comments or improvements on this are welcome.

Ignore the second patch, obviously I cannot delete wrong attachements. The patch #1 is the right one.

I agree, (if I remember) : delete() is the only method provided by Zend\_Db\_Table that doesn't escape automatically the parameters it is passed. That seems nonsense, but perhaps there is a good reason ?

Well I can't see any, at least not in this implementation. When there are no additional paremeters given, any question mark in the $where clause is ignored, so it will all stay backward compatible.

For the sake of uniformity I would suggest passing the second arg as an array. IIRC $db->query() works this way.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

It would certainly make using delete easier.

I think it would be better to make it...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $myModel->delete('foo = ? AND bar = ?', array($foo, $bar));


Just in case we would ever want to add a third argument. Also it make's it easy to pass a list of elements to bind.

An update from my side, Zend\_Db\_Table::update() should also have that quoting functionallity. By the way another nice thing would be, if you could also supply a Zend\_Db\_Select() for both update() and delete() method for more complex operations.

This issue has gone unaddressed for too long. I'm re-assigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

I wouldn't recommend doing this as a variable number of arguments. It makes calling the function when you have an array of bind parameters much harder. See #ZF-3074 for an alternate way, just as James suggested, including patch and tests, along with Zend\_Db\_Table implementations as well.

Just taking out the "Fixed Version".

Why can't you use the where format that is expected (by Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract in update and delete):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $model->delete(array('foo = ?' => $foo, 'bar = ?' => $bar));


Seems like this is a non issue, if the issue is about automatic quoting.

This issue has been tossed from one "fix version" to the next for 2.5 years. Does this even still apply? If so, I still hold firm on my previous comment.

I'm closing this one, as we have discussed this a few times, and there is a solution to this problem available already, it simply is not the one suggested. As mentioned in ralphs previous comment, this notation will allow bindings for where clauses on update / delete calls.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update('table', $data, array('foo  = ?' => $bar, 'baz = ?' => $bat));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->delete('table', array('foo  = ?' => $bar, 'baz = ?' => $bat));


There is no point keeping this open for another 2 years!
