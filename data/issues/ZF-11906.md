First: don't use runtests.sh -- we should likely remove that. Second, I ran into this issue in ZF2, mainly in tests that use the "runInSeparateProcess" annotation; the solution for that is to do a "defined(...) || define(...)" style declaration. This, however, is not related to 5.4 specifically.

When we ran tests on 5.4rc2, what we found was:

- There were BC breaks in some ob\*() functions -- but these were fixed in a subsequent RC.
- Array to string conversion now raises warnings, which can break tests. These are cases where we _will_ need to fix code for tests to run normally.
- Classes extending an abstract class and redefining the constructor but with different arguments will now raise an E\_FATAL. We only had one place we were doing this, and it shouldn't have occurred anyways -- but it will need to be corrected.

The biggest thing to focus on is the second point, above.
