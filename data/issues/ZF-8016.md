ZF-8016: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper() does not initialize the helper
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When retrieving a helper statically with getStaticHelper(), the helper is not properly initialized - by calling it's init() method. The Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract constructor does not call init() method as well.

As the purpose of init methods is to initialize the class, without having to override the constructor, maybe it would be better to implement a call to init()0 in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract constructor or in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker getStaticHelper() method - that proxies to \_loadHelper() method.

Actually, the Abstract action helper does not define a constructor at all; if you want to do initialization tasks in helpers, the time to do it is in the constructor. I've removed the init() method at this point as it is uncalled from anywhere, and was simply confusing the issue.

This patch destroyed my project ;)

Throws fatal error: ````

Matthew,

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, the init() you just removed actually _is_ called from several places in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker. Namely:

In Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::\_\_construct() on line 253
======================================================================

In Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getHelper() on line 307
==================================================================

I am adding my helper in Bootstrap this way:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::addHelper(
                new IPMCore_Controller_Action_Helpers_NavigationLoader());

init() is called in several locations, but not from getStaticHelper(). Re-opening.

I'm reinstating the init() method as it _was_ in use. However, this request will not be honored.

init() in the action helpers is called when the broker is instantiated -- at which time, the action controller is available and injected into each action helper currently registered with the broker. As such, it is intended to allow you to setup a clean object state for the new action controller and/or perform actions that require knowledge of the action controller -- not perform constructor initialization tasks. If you need tasks done at construction time, do them in the constructor, or call init() from your constructor.

Although the request will not be honored, I think it will be nice to add a note in the reference guide, specifying that construction time tasks should be defined in custom constructor or init() methods.
