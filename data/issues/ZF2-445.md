### Description

Using Accept encoding of gzip, and receiving gzipped content with an http\\client doesn't cause the data to be decompressed, and returns garbage. Instead you have to set the accept encoding to ''.

This existed in ZF1: [http://robertbolton.com/blog/â€¦](http://www.robertbolton.com/blog/zend_http_client-and-garbled-response-body)

incorrect usage - use getBody instead of getContent on the Response object
