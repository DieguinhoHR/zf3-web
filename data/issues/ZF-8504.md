ZF-8504: DB\_Select "AS" Problem
--------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-09T02:18:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:17.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

File: Zend/Db/Select.php

935 // Check for a column matching " AS " and extract the alias name 936 if (preg\_match('/^(.+)\\s+' . self::SQL\_AS . '\\s+(.+)$/i', $col, $m)) {

the preg\_match makes problems if you have a function with an "AS" in the column part

example: $select = $DB->select( )->from( 'table', array( 'Id', 'ColumnAlias' => 'CAST( Column AS SIGNED )' ) ); sql result: SELECT `table`.`Id`, `table`.`CAST( Column` AS `SIGNED )` FROM `table`

you can fix it with 936 if (preg\_match('/^(.+)\\s+' . self::SQL\_AS . '\\s+(.[^\\s' . self::SQL\_AS . '\\s])$/i', $col, $m)) {

Your regex is flawed because it used a list.

[as] equivalent the a|s

Try use

CAST(column) AS alias.

what do you mean with List? I have tested this regex with some querys and all works fine

Any alias preceded by an element of the list.

problem in ^(.+)\\s+AS\\s+(.+[^\\sAS\\s])$

Test 1: column AS xxs

Test 2: column AS dda
