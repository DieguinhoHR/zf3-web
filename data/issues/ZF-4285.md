### Description

Hi, Playing with phpunit 3.2.12 and xdebug gives me this :

$ phpunit --coverage-html ... RuntimeException: Could not create and run test suite: Overloading of non-public properties is prohibited in /usr/share/php/PHPUnit/TextUI/Command.php on line 118

I saw this bug was already managed, so I tried to add $view->setUseStreamWrapper(false); on my bootstrap file but did nothing. I also tried phpunit -d "short\_open\_tags=on"... that did nothing either. I googled the problem but found no solution so I'm resending this problem.

Should this issue be closed?
