ZF-8011: addJavascript() uses preg\_replace when trim would suffice

### Description

In ZendX/JQuery/View/Helper/JQuery/Container.php - addJavascript($js) function, the first line is:

$js = preg\_replace('/^\\s_(._?)\\s\*$/s', '$1', $js);

I believe this is simply trimming whitespace from either end. trim function would be more efficient.

If $js is a very large string then addJavascript($js) fails to add $js as expected.

In my case (checking with preg\_last\_error) I had reached/exceeded the backtrack limit (PREG\_BACKTRACK\_LIMIT\_ERROR).

Using trim() may be more efficient and would also remove this limit.

The preg\_replace does not work with large string in deed. This is critical bug, please fix it.

My suggestion is to remove lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $js = preg_replace('/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/s', '$1', $js);
            if (!in_array(substr($js, -1), array(';', '}'))) {
                $js .= ';';
            }


Reasons: \* Why should PHP class fix JavaScript code which a programmer wrote ? He could make much more mistakes then to forget ; in last line or to enter too many spaces. \* This processing is taking unnecessary CPU on each request. \* It is confusing to the JavaScript programmer that his code got changed.

If there is a plan to include some more sophisticated JavaScript minifier (I don't see a practical usage until it will not support caching) it should be optional.

Thank you for your contributed work to ZF.
