ZF-12399: Search query with multibyte unicode chars and wildcards does not recognize wildcard prefix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

While testing with unicode search queries, I see that Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Wildcard does not use multibyte-safe string functions (eg: strlen instead of mb\_strlen). May be that an issue?

(sorry not a bug actually!)
