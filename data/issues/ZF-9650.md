### Description

I have been trying to set the id for all form elements manually which was not possible using normal Zend Form elements like "hidden". By analysing the code i noticed that parameters are sent wrong to the Zend\_Form View Helpers using the Dojo form Decorator DijitElement.

Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitElement Line 183 $elementContent = $view->$helper($name, $value, $dijitParams, $attribs, $options);

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormHidden line 53 public function formHidden($name, $value = null, array $attribs = null)

Instead of the "attribs" formhidden is receiving the $dijitParam.
