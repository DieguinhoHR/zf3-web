ZF-11314: Serializing an object containing a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract will kill the database connection

### Description

If any object containing a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract object is serialised the database connection is destroyed forcing a reconnect.

This is caused by the \_connection variable being set to false in \_\_sleep. Simple solution is to remove that line. The \_\_sleep return value is telling PHP not to serialise \_connection anyway so it is redundant.
