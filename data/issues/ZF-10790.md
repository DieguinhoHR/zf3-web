### Description

Hi,

Zend and Google both says that spreadsheet can't be created with API as of now so it's perfect. Google help says "Adding a worksheet" in existing spreadsheet is possible using Spreadsheets API, however I couldn't find any reference in Zend which i can try for.

Generally I look at [http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Gdata/Spreadsheets/Zend_Gdata_Spreadsheets.html) for help.

Cheers, -Jigs
