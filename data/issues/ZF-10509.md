### Description

Currently, the priority level used for logging is _critical_ in all cases. It makes no sense, because there are differences between a error _code 404_ and _500_ : \* a _code 500_ represents a runtime exception \* any resource that does not exist is redirected to the front controller. The traffic by robots or the search for files as the favicon for some browsers lead to an exception _no controller_. This could be an important source of spam \* a typo or dead link can be the source of an exception _no action_ \* a configuration error on routes or only use static routes (or too specialized) should throw an exception _no route_

A _code 500_ should stay in critical priority, and we should lower the level at warning or notice for the _code 404_. This can be refined for _code 404_. An exception due to the absence of a route might need to be raised even in production.
