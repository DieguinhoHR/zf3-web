ZF-8168: Zend\_Amf Serializer problem
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-28T08:06:35.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-28T15:00:31.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

My function code: if (! ($this->\_cache->test ( $cache\_id )) { # generate data # save to cache # return data } else { # load data from cache # return data }

The problem is when data from cache is loaded I get the following Notice: Undefined property: VOKpiValues::$1962 in **/var/www/html/Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Serializer.php** on line **469**

So the problem is only, when data is loaded from cache. "1962" is an object with some properties. When I disable error\_reporting "1962" is set to null.

It is duplicate of ZF-8169.
