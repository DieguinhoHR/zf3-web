-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

elementPrefixPath doesn't load from config and doesn't quite work. Here is the fix:

in Form.php setOptions method add:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($options['elementPrefixPath'])) {
       $this->addElementPrefixPaths($options['elementPrefixPath']);
       unset($options['elementPrefixPath']);
    }


And in Form.php addElementPrefixPaths method, change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_elementPrefixPaths[] = $this->_elementPrefixPaths + $spec;


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_elementPrefixPaths = $this->_elementPrefixPaths + $spec;
