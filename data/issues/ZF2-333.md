ZF2-333: Error using the EventManagerAwareInterface
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-05-30T12:49:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-06-14T15:31:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

In Zend\\Mvc\\Service\\ServiceManagerConfiguration.php the import for EventManagerAwareInterface is missing. Therefore the EventManager is never injected in any class implementing the Interface.

Adding the import "use Zend\\EventManager\\EventManagerAwareInterface;" will raise an error in the Skeleton Application: "Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\\ModuleManager\\Exception\\RuntimeException' with message 'Module (Application) could not be initialized.' in E:\\workspace\\application\\vendor\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\ModuleManager\\ModuleManager.php on line 118"

I actually ran into this yesterday, too. I've got a branch with a fix for this as well as some other changes to the ServiceManager bootstrapping process.

[https://github.com/EvanDotPro/zf2/…](https://github.com/EvanDotPro/zf2/compare/feature/bootstrap-redux)

The fix is having EventManagerAwareInterface extend EventsCapableInterface, then in the ServiceManagerConfiguration, we not only check $instance instanceof EventManagerAwareInterface, but also $instance->events() instanceof EventManagerInterface.

Yesterday you pointed out that my other submitted bug was fixed in [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1376/files#diff-1) and I noticed that there are two different Interfaces (ServiceLocatorAwareInterface and ServiceManagerAwareInterface) which are obviously doing the same. This is really confusing me. Can you please have a look at that too or give me a hint why there are two Interfaces for the same purpose? Thank you.

I had a short discussion with Ralph and Matthew about this yesterday. Basically the explanation is (and this doesn't solve the confusion factor) that ServiceLocator is a basic interface that defines what a locator is. ServiceManager is a specific concrete implementation of the ServiceLocator. The idea is that you could, in theory, swap the ServiceManager out with your own, lighter weight locator implementation if you wanted to. I agree with this in concept, but I think the way things are now, with some things being ServiceLocatorAware, and others ServiceManagerAware is confusing, hard to document clearly, and I'm not entirely convinced we should even have an interface like ServiceManagerAware that hints on the concrete implementation in the first place. I don't have a specific idea for a solution, but I do think something needs to change.

Fixed with [PR 1500](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1500)... Decided to pull the fix out of my [bootstrap-redux branch](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1495) so we do not have to wait on the other changes to be complete and reviewed.
