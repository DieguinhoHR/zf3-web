### Description

Hello

We're trying to get a centralized authentication system for all our web applications with Zend\_OpenID but we cannot easily achieve this task because of an existing password database encoded in blowfish.

We figure out that Zend\_OpenId\_Provider does a static md5 call before calling Zend\_OpenId\_Storage and that's why we cannot do that. We've patched the framework in order to move the hash or the encode process to the storage. That is the easier and the most generic solution we've found.

Please. consider the attached path
