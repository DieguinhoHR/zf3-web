### Description

I am using additional columns in some of my intersection tables for many to many relationships. Using findManyToManyRowset used to add these columns to the returning rowset. Having updated to the newest version, these columns dont get added anymore.

Source-Code:

Class: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract In version 1.9.8 the function findManyToManyRowset returned the columns of the intersection table like so:

 
        $select->from(array('i' => $interName), *Zend_Db_Select::SQL_WILDCARD*, $interSchema)
               ->joinInner(array('m' => $matchName), $joinCond, Zend_Db_Select::SQL_WILDCARD, $matchSchema)
               ->setIntegrityCheck(false);


This has been changed to:

 
        $select->from(array('i' => $interName), *array()*, $interSchema)
               ->joinInner(array('m' => $matchName), $joinCond, Zend_Db_Select::SQL_WILDCARD, $matchSchema)
               ->setIntegrityCheck(false);


Is this change intended - and if so, how do I access the columns in the intersection table using the functionality of this function?

This is by design. The junction data should have never been part of the resulting row object to begin off with. Please see my write-up here:
