### Description

After update of PHP on version 5.2.12 adapter didn't work any more. I was searching for solution and found a solution. I changed function getFileName in class Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract where I replaced:

 
        if (count($result) == 1) {
            return current($result);
        }


to

 
        if (count($result) == 1) {
            return array_pop($result);
        }


And it now it works.

Your change breaks the component as it does then no longer return a string but an array.

Additionally getFileName() does not look at "name" => $value. So getFileName() is not able to throw such a failure.

You should give reproducable informations to us
