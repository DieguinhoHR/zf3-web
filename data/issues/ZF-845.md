ZF-845: Multi cookie

### Description

It would be great a multi cookie support (see <http://www.zend.com/codex.php?id=679&single=1>).

According to multi cookie idea Zend\_Http\_Cookie::setValue() should be able to accept an array as argument and choose to serialize or not stored data depending on cookie type (multi or single value). Zend\_Http\_Cookie::getValue() should return a single value or an array.

Hi,

This is a bit problematic as far as I am concerned because I am not aware of any "standard" way of serializing arrays as a cookie value. Remember that the Http\_Client is used to communicate with many different web servers running many different apps and languages - not just PHP.

You could always overload the Zend\_Http\_Cookie class to support this for your own needs. I suggest you open a discussion about this in fw-webservices@lists.zend.com and see what the community suggest.

You're right, but consider that serialize and unserialize process will be done by Zend\_Http\_Cookie class and outside data will be set and get using arrays. Data stream will be

array() --> Zend\_Http\_Cookie --> serialize() --> cookie and cookie --> unserialize() --> Zend\_Http\_Cookie --> array()

Actually data stream is

string --> Zend\_Http\_Cookie --> cookie and cookie --> Zend\_Http\_Cookie --> string

Thanks for your suggestion! I will try to code something and I will share my ideas on web services mailing list. :)

Please reopen this as an improvement suggestion if you think this is still important after discussing with fw-webservices@lists.zend.com

Shahar.
