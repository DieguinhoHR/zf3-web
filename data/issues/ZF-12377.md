### Description

NOT A BUG but a minor typo in URL might lead to an embarrassing behavior.

exemple, the Url :

<http://server.com///directory/controller/action> (notice de 3 slashes)

without resources.frontController.baseUrl being set will STILL be dispatched okay BUT obviously with useless baseUrl : "///directory". Resulting page is pretty ugly since the view is rendered without its external links
