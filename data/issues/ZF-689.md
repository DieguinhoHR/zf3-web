ZF-689: Zend\_Http\_Client sets wrong HTTP protocol version
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-12-24T17:19:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client is locale dependent and it doesn't work on locales where decimal symbol is represented by coma sign instead of dot. When I set the locale to pl\_PL (Polish) Zend\_Http\_Client tried set this header:

{quote}GET / HTTP/1,1{quote}

instead of:

{quote}GET / HTTP/1.1{quote}

so I got the 400 response (Bad request).

This affects all classes which utiilize http\_client eg. Zend\_Feed.

It could be resolved by changing HTTP protocol versions value types from float to string. Then value won't be affected by current locale.

I've tried to fix it in revision 2507 - please update and test again.

As I have no way to test this myself (only have English locales installed), please let me know after you test so I can resolve the issue.

TIA.

I've tested revision 2507 and now it works properly. I think you can mark issue as resolved. Thanks.
