ZF-4707: Zend\_Form: Elements with filtered names return empty on validation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-25T15:06:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-07T05:58:19.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When a form element is added to a Zend\_Form (or Zend\_Dojo\_Form), the elements name is filtered for invalid characters (like . , / etc), the filtered elementname is used in the HTML form element.

Example: param.dbname becomes paramdbname

The unfiltered name is used in the \_elements array as the key which refers to the specific element.

This causes a problem when a form with some elements with filtered names is validated, these elements turn up empty.

The correct behaviour would, at least imho, be that the isValid function checks the provided data array for the filtered elementname and the getValues method would then return the validated input with the original element names.

The implementation of Zend\_Form dictates this; basically, only valid PHP variable names are allowed as form element names within Zend\_Form. Changing this would require many architectural changes, and would mean a variety of behaviors and functionality of Zend\_Form would not be possible.

Won't fix.

Filtering invalid names silently and by thus breaking form population is not the best alternative IMO (I just spent a lot time finding this as the cause for my bug ;)). I would prefer having Zend\_Form throwing an exception if I try to set an invalid name instead.
