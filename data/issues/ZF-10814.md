### Description

$this->assertResponseCode(200); currently gives (when in error): "Failed asserting response code "200""

I would propose changing it to something like: "Failed asserting that response code <301> matches expected <200>."

This way you can see what the actual error code was, and it's more in line with assertEquals().
