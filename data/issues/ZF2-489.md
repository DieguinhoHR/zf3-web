ZF2-489: Form View Helpers do not translate placeholder attribute
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Form View Helpers for labels and selects use the translator object to translate labels and select options. Unfortunately, all text based view helpers do not translate any placeholder attribute. This should be added.

I add this here, since it is somehow connected. When I add a submit button to a form, the value attribute holds the text displayed on the button. Unfortunately, this value text is not translated at all. Zend\\Form\\View\\Helper\\FormSubmit needs to be change to get the value translated if a translator object is set. FormReset and FormButton have the same problem.

Either FormInput::render() must be changed for this or FormSubmit, FormReset and FormButton need to have their own render() method for translation the value attribute.

Ralf -- I think that particular instance is fixed on current master due to a PR I merged earlier today. Can you please test?

Matthew - The earlier PR I think only addressed FormButton. FormSubmit and FormReset are currently still outstanding.

I have a PR ready for FormSubmit (marked for 2.1): <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2124> ...but FormReset would need the same logic. I will update FormReset and commit to this same PR.

Matthew,

I looked here

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/library/Zend/Form/View/Helper)

But there was only a change 5 hours ago for FormMultiCheckbox. I don't see any changes for both the placeholder translation nor the value attribute translation for submit, button and reset.

Am I looking at the wrong place?

I wonder why this is marked for 2.1...

Updated PR and included FormReset: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2124>

On IRC, Matthew mentioned this could probably go into 2.0.1 (earlier than 2.1).
