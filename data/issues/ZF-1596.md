### Description

_Summary:_ When attempting to create a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Where instance from XML that contains a rel attribute, the user receives the following error: ````

_Steps to Reproduce:_ 1. Create a new XML document containing a gd:where element with a rel attribute. 2. Instantiate a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_Where and populate it with the XML document created in Step 1.

_Expected Results:_ There should be no errors.

_Actual Results:_ Population fails with the error message listed above.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r4990, affects 1.0.0 RC1 and RC2.

_Notes:_ This is pretty much the same as ZF-1595 but in a different file. A test for this will also be included for this in ZF-1593.

Fixed in my build, patch sent to rboyd for review.
