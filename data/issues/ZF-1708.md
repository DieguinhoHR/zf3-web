### Description

testAdapterTransactionCommit() and testAdapterTransactionRollback() are currently skipped for DB2 with the message: "DB2 has a problem with concurrent access to the same table"

DB2 is actually behaving as designed as there are special considerations to be taken into account to show true concurrency within the same process:

[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/…](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/admin/r0001917.htm) [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/…](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.apdv.embed.doc/doc/c0006107.htm)

As a suggestion, $dbConnection2 can use an isolation level of "uncommitted read". It will be able to read the data even before $dbConnection1 has commited, but as the name implies, it will be seeing the new updated, though not committed data.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dbConnection2->getConnection();
    $dbConnection2->query('SET ISOLATION LEVEL = UR');


Accordingly, the asserts in testAdapterTransactionCommit() and testAdapterTransactionRollback() would need to be changed to show that $dbConnection2 is seeing the changes done by $dbconnection1.

The final asserts after the transaction ends or is rolled back show that $dbConnection2 is seeing what was committed or rolledback as expected.

I will upload DB2Test.php with the changes. Please review and incorporate as appropriate.

Applied patch in revision 6014.

DB2 apparently has pretty limited support for concurrency. Unfortunate. But this is a patch to unit tests that are testing whether commit() and rollback() are working. That goal has been met.

NOTE: this test will be a bit more complex in the PDO\_IBM adapter, because it supports both DB2 and XPS. From what I have read, DB2 uses syntax "SET ISOLATION LEVEL = UR", but XPS has syntax "SET ISOLATION LEVEL TO DIRTY READ".

Updating Fix Version to follow issue tracker conventions.
