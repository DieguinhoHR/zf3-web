ZF-1112: Support arbitrary switching of the adapter for a single HTTP client instance

### Description

The request() method does not mind the adapter configuration once an adapter has been loaded. Consequent to this fact and the current API restrictions (non-public related class members), it seems impossible to change the adapter once an adapter is available.

A workaround is to create separate Zend\_Http\_Client objects for each adapter needed in a particular use case. (My particular use case is unit testing Zend\_Service\_Flickr.) The workaround is suboptimal because it requires management of an object for each different adapter, whereas the class could allow changing the adapter for a single Zend\_Http\_Client instance dynamically, throughout the instance's lifetime.

There are several ways in which this could be solved, but I would like to defer to Shahar for comment.

This could probably be alleviated by marking loadAdapter() as public instead of protected.
