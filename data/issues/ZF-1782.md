ZF-1782: Add a new option to load translation sources afterwards
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2007-07-27T02:15:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-11-01T16:51:14.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

A new option should be added which allows Zend\_Translate to load a language when it's needed.

Now all languages have to be loaded in memory, which makes it consume much memory if you are having much translations.

With this option "reducememory" Zend\_Translate would first load only which languages are avaiable and check if the files are properly or defect.

As soon as a translation occurs the expected language will be loaded. Internally the list of known languages makes it possible to act as it is done now.

The loading of the language afterwards mean \*) Only one language in memory \*) Needs more time on the first translation of a language as all needed sources are loaded

Most applications would probably only use one or two of multiple languages so the benefit is given on a real multi-lingual application.

Will not be implemented.

The benefit is only acceptable for applications with more than 50.000 translation. And this applications will split their translations in multiple pieces and not load them all together.

Loading the translations afterwards is not precticable for all adapters. It will maybe implemented for single adapters like SQL.
