### Description

When you add an action to a controller that already has data in it, the closing curly brace before the function's closing on each function gets removed and the functions get some strange new indentation on everything but the first line.

I've been bitten by this a few times and thought it was fixed by now. I also thought I reported this before, but I can't see a bug report for it.

_Steps to reproduce the issue:_

> zf create project test
> 
> Changed IndexController - indexAction to:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
    
        public function init()
        {
            /* Initialize action controller here */
        }
    
        public function indexAction()
        {
            if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
                //something
                if ($form->isValid($_POST)) {
                    //something
                }
            }
        }
    
    }

> cd test zf create action foo

And the IndexController looks this way:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
    
        public function init()
        {
            /* Initialize action controller here */
        }
    
        public function indexAction()
        {
            if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
                        //something
                        if ($form->isValid($_POST)) {
                            //something
                        }
        }
    
        public function fooAction()
        {
            // action body
        }
    
    
    }

This problem is related to Zend\_Reflection\_Method::getBody(). See issue ZF-9018.

Issue duplicated of ZF-9501

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'duplicate' don't need a fix version -- it makes them appear in the JIRA changelog and/or roadmap.
