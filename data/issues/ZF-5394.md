### Description

I tried to get an instance of Zend\_Mime\_Message via its createFromMessage() method but I am getting an E\_WARNING (see. below). I tried to find out what it is causing it and found out, that an array instead of a string will be put as parameter to Zend\_Mime\_Part's constructor. You have to use $part['body'] instead of $part as parameter for Zend\_Mime\_Part::\_\_construct().

{quote}Notice: Array to string conversion in /usr/share/php/Zend/Mime.php on line 131{quote}
