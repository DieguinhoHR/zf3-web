### Description

Aren't all testcases supposed to revert system as it was after execution Cause I get tons of files created and left there after executing test suits.

Attached is jmut@<a>dexter:/storage/www/frameworks/zendframework</a>$ svn up At revision 7623

jmut@<a>dexter:/storage/www/frameworks/zendframework</a>$ cd tests; php AllTests.php ........

jmut@<a>dexter:/storage/www/frameworks/zendframework</a>$ svn st Attached is the output

it doesn't seem to be a Zend\_Cache problem (these files do not belong to Zend Cache unit tests)

Yes, you are right. Seems not Zend\_Cache but Zend\_Date issue.

To reproduce cd tests; php Zend/Date/AllTests.php svn st

@Thomas Weidner I think it is good practice to leave comment on any changes of issues. Why was Zend\_Date component removed from issue? Should I create new one specific for it ?

Please categorize/fix as needed.

We will fix this in the 2.0 unit tests. Artifacts should be cleaned up after a test run. Hopefully there will be some ZF testsuite facilities or PHPUnit facilities we can utilize.
