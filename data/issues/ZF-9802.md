### Description

When implementing the Zend\_Application\_Resouce\_Mail for use of sendmail via configs as outlined at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.available-resources.html#zend.application.available-resources.mail), using shorthand in resources.mail.transport.type (eg: 'smtp') does not work, giving the following error:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Warning: include(smtp.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/app/public/index.php(38) : runtime-created function on line 1
    
    Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening 'smtp.php' for inclusion (include_path='/path/to/ZendFramework') in /path/to/app/public/index.php(38) : runtime-created function on line 1
    
    Warning: include(smtp.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/app/public/index.php(38) : runtime-created function on line 1
    
    Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening 'smtp.php' for inclusion (include_path='/path/to/ZendFramework') in /path/to/app/public/index.php(38) : runtime-created function on line 1
    
    Fatal error: Class 'smtp' not found in /path/to/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Application/Resource/Mail.php on line 140


Using the longhand like so works:

````

But this differs from the docs, so either the docs need to be updated to reflect the need to use the full name for transport type, or the \_setupTransport() method needs to be updated in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Mail to allow shorthanded transport types. I personally think it's cleaner to allow shorthanded transport names, and based on a quick look at the \_setupTransport() method, it looks like that is the intent. I'm going to give a shot at a patch and will post here if I am successful.

Could it be there is a file called smtp.php or Smtp.php in your include path? The unittests thoroughly test the behavior you describe and as such I'm not able to reproduce this issue.

Awaiting more info on how to reproduce this issue.

Nope, the only smtp.php in my include path is the one in Zend/Mail/Transport.

To reproduce, put the following in your application.ini:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    resources.mail.transport.type       = smtp
    resources.mail.transport.host       = "smtp.server.com"
    resources.mail.transport.auth       = login
    resources.mail.transport.username   = "myLogin"
    resources.mail.transport.password   = "myPasswd"


The above does not work. The config below works fine:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    resources.mail.transport.type       = Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp
    resources.mail.transport.host       = "smtp.server.com"
    resources.mail.transport.auth       = login
    resources.mail.transport.username   = "myLogin"
    resources.mail.transport.password   = "myPasswd"


I've whipped up a quick patch that works for both cases, will attach. It's my first time submitting a patch, so please forgive me if I've done it wrong.

The problem with your patch is that it doesn't allow for transport names like someOtherLib\_Mail\_Transport\_SmtpFoobar. I'm closing this issue as cannot reproduce until you're able to provide a unittest, or more information on how to reproduce.

ACK; please fix doc or code to use "smtp". You can reproduce it with a default application created. This bug is also reported here: <http://www.zfforum.de/showthread.php?t=6332>
