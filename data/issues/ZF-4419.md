### Description

It is stopper for me - I must change Zend folder (add units from snapshot) to work with Firebird in every new release. I am working with it in bigger project and everything in snapshots releases work fine (one small mistake with showing of errors form db like PRIMARY KEY VIOLATION etc. I have written as small Bug issue). There is no reason to block these units in next releases - moreover it has been promised for 1.5 stable release - so I have started to use before the release, thinking I will go for oficial version on March...

Please see ZendX\_Db\_Adapter\_Firebird in the extras library shipped with 1.7.0. Sorry for the delay. :(

Hi Wil, I'd like to ask few questions:

There's no ZendX\_Db\_Adapter\_Firebird in 1.7.0. It's in 1.7.1. Shouln't this be added in minor release instead of mini releas?
================================================================================================================================

There's no documentation for this adapter nor in Reference Guide neither in API Guide. Just a shor paragraph (13.1.10.10) in Reference Guide, but not even mentioning that the adapter is in extras. How can be such an undocumented adapter contained in release?
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Why isn't this adapter mentioned in changelog?!
===============================================
