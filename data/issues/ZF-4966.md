### Description

The current description of the effects of using Zend\_Session\_Namespace::setExpirationHops() is as follows:

"Expiration can be based on either elapsed seconds or the number of "hops", where a hop occurs for each successive request that instantiates the namespace at least once. "

If I am not misinterpreting the wording, then this states that if a namespace is set to expire in 5 hops, then it will expire after 5 requests have instantiated that namespace. A more logical use case, and what appears to be happening when I test this feature, is for a "hop" to be a request which does _not_ instantiate the namespace. I think this line in the docs should be changed to: "Expiration can be based on either elapsed seconds or the number of "hops", where a hop occurs for each successive request in which the namespace is never instantiated. "

You are right about the documentation, it's wrong and is now updated (to trunk r12694, not online yet), thx :)

look at the setExpirationHops() signature :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setExpirationHops($hops, $variables = null, $hopCountOnUsageOnly = false)


it should answer the question much deeper
