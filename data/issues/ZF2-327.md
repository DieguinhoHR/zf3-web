### Description

Whatever I do I get no error nor object to work with. Other validators work as expected.

At the Zend\\Validator\\File\\Upload the construct suppose to catch $\_FILES in no file list was passed. Seems like it dont.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # from the form object
    
    $this->add($factory->createElement(array(
        'name'  => 'resource_file',
        'attributes' => array(
            'label' => 'File:',
            'type'  => 'file',
        ),
    )));


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # from the filter (one of the variation I tried )
    
    $this->add($factory->createInput(array(
        'name'       => 'resource_file',
        'required'   => true,
        'validators' => array(
            array(
                'name'      => 'File\Upload',
                'options'   => array (
                    'files' => $_FILES,
                ),
                'files' => $_FILES,
            ),
        ),
    )));
