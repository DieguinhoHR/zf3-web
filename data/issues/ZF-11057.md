### Description

I'm using the class in a Daemon context.

So I need to send that log entries several times.

The implementation of the class only allows a one-time-usage, even though the function shutdown is public and therefore callable several times.

In my opinion the shutdown function should use a copy of the initially provided mail object, instead of using the same one with every call.

Salut Benoît.

Check out the function and try to think about what happens when you call it twice.

- the list of entries is accumulated every time you call shutdown
- but even before that the function crashes becaus setSubject is called twice
