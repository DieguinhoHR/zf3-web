ZF-1004: Add support for stream context in the Socket adapter
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-03-02T07:13:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:42:10.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.2 (25/Sep/07)
 
 Reporter:  Shahar Evron (shahar)  Assignee:  Shahar Evron (shahar)  Tags: - Zend\_Http\_Client

 Attachments: - [zend\_http\_client\_sslcert.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/10660/zend_http_client_sslcert.patch)
 
### Description

Currently, the default Socket adapter does not support stream contexts - for example, there is no way to set a local certificate for HTTPS connections (might be important for PayPal access for example)

We should either improve the socket adapter to support this or create a new adapter based on stream\_socket\_client() instead of fsockopen().

apparently, stream\_context\_set\_params() can be used on sockets created by fsockopen as well - so there is not much rewriting to be done here. This can be done using a new configuration option and a call to stream\_context\_set\_params() on the socket after opening the connection.

I have attached a patch that changes the Socket adapter to use stream\_context\_create() instead of fsockopen(), and adds 'sslcert' and 'sslpassphrase' options to allow client SSL certificates to be used. Although the conversion from fsockopen() to stream\_socket\_client() may not have been needed, it only required changes in a few lines of code and as far as I can tell does not have any drawbacks.
