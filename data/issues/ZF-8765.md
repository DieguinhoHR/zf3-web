### Description

Autoloading is surely useful, but not every project uses it. ZF seems to recognize this, in that most ZF classes in the framework/library do not depend upon it.

For example, when throwing an exception, most ZF classes do something like:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    require_once 'Zend/SomePackage/Exception.php';
    throw new Zend_SomePackage_Exception('Invalid foo');


However, there are several places in Zend\_Application where it seems that autoloading is implicitly assumed.

For example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        protected function _loadConfig($file)
        {
            $environment = $this->getEnvironment();
            $suffix      = strtolower(pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    
            switch ($suffix) {
                case 'ini':
                    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini($file, $environment);
                    break;
    
                case 'xml':
                    $config = new Zend_Config_Xml($file, $environment);
                    break;
    
                case 'php':
                case 'inc':
                    $config = include $file;
                    if (!is_array($config)) {
                        throw new Zend_Application_Exception('Invalid configuration file provided; PHP file does not return array value');
                    }
                    return $config;
                    break;
    
                default:
                    throw new Zend_Application_Exception('Invalid configuration file provided; unknown config type');
            }
    
            return $config->toArray();
        }


Note that the object instantiations and the exception throws do _not_ require/include the relevant files before use. They seem to assume autoloading, right? Zend\_Application itself does not extend from any other class, so we cannot assume that there is some parent taking care of it for us.

Not sure if this qualifies as an issue, but wanted to bring it up. Love the framework so I'd like to do what I can to help. As a total n00b with ZF and with modern tools like SVN, I probably can't help by actually fixing anything - yet! - but hopefully little stuff like this helps at least somewhat.

Cheers!

From the reference guide:

{quote}4.1. Introduction

Zend\_Application provides a bootstrapping facility for applications which provides reusable resources, common- and module-based bootstrap classes and dependency checking. It also takes care of setting up the PHP environment and introduces autoloading by default.{quote}

Because Zend\_App can take care of setting up autoloading, and does so by default, it's been decided to make zend\_app entirely reliant on autoloading. Therefore, I'm closing this issue as not an issue. Feel free to comment if you have any further questions.

@Dolf: Thanks for the pointer to the Zend\_Application introduction. I missed that. Sorry.

Sure, if the decision has been made to make Zend\_Application reliant on autoloading, then there is no issue here. Just thought I had caught something that had slipped through the cracks.

Cheers!
