ZF-2505: Unused variable - possibly wrong assignment?
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

In Zend\_Config\_Ini::\_\_construct(), line 109 a variable $numberOfBits is set to count($bits), but never used from that point on.

The value it is initialized to is used for a switch a few lines down, by performing the count($bits) again. Looks like a piece of code left over from refactoring from If() to a Switch().

Was this merged to the 1.5 branch for inclusion in 1.5.0?

No, I thought it into 1.0.5 if 1.0.5 is scheduled.
