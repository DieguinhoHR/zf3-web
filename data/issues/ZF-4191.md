### Description

{quote} $form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->addElement('radio', 'myName', array( 'value' => '-1', 'multiOptions' => array( 'inherit' => 'inherit', -1 => 'reset', 1 => 'allow', 0 => 'deny', ), )); $form->populate(array('myName' => 'inherit')); echo $form; {quote}

Generated xhtml:

{quote} inherit   
 reset   
 allow   
 deny {quote}

has two elements with same id "myName-1" (options "-1" and "1"). Also "0 => 'deny'" option is selected, but I have populated form with "'myName' => 'inherit'". Also "0 => 'deny'" option will be selected by default, but I set default "'value' => '-1'".

Patch to fix the issue. The problem was that dashes were filtered from the id through the use of the alnum filter. In the patch a regex is used to allow both alphanumeric characters and dashes.

Is there any chance of getting this fixed or adding the patch to trunk?

I've hesitated to merge this into release as it may cause a BC break for those who reference their Zend\_Form elements by id from a view script. Thoughts?

I would patch this.
