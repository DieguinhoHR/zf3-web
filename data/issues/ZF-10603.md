ZF-10603: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname Allows Illegal Domain "foo.-.com"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When validating domain names, the following was found:

$validator = new Zend\_Validator\_Hostname(); $domain='foo.-.com'; echo ($validator->isValid($domain)) ? 'pass!' : 'fail!';

Expected: "fail!" Recieved: "pass!"

Domain name containing only "-.com" passes validation.

This bug was noticed in a slightly older version of the framework, so it's entirely possible that it's been fixed since then. I can compare the versions but as long as it works in the current version, I'm good with that.

Closing as non reproducable. Tested on 1.11 and 2.0. Both show "fail" as expected.
