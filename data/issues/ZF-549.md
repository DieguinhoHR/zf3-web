### Description

I have problem to create proper cfs file after moving project to final server ( Linux shared hosting ). On my machine ( windows xh ) everything works great but on destination machine cfs file is very small and ofcourse there is no search results. I'm not pasteing any code because this must be some well known bug( I hope ), in my application I take pattern from this article <http://blog.northclick.de/archives/4> and as I said everything works fine on my machine. \_0.cfs loks like fine, but instead proper database query results it has only row names:) in it

Does this happen when you copy your index from Windows to Linux? Or does it happen if create your index on Linux?

That would be good, if you attach your index, index creation and search scripts to the issue.

PS It may be the same bug as [ZF-440](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-440) or [ZF-532](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-440). I work on both of them now. But any additional information may be helpful.

One question. Is destination platform 64-bit? :)

When I copy my index files from Windows to Linux everything looks ok

No Destination pltform is not 64bit

I found soulution for this problem, as usually the problem is related with transcoding:)

When I changed line in Zend/Search/Lucene/Field.php in constructor from $this->stringValue = iconv('', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', $stringValue) to $this->stringValue = iconv('ISO-8859-2', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', $stringValue) everything started working:)

As I see in todo there will be "@todo Correct UTF-8 string should be required in future" so in the future problem should be solved:)

Is covered by new encoding processing functionality.

Details are described in documentation and [FW-General](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/18963)
