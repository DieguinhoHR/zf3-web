### Description

Currently the way the method works triggers a warning because it doesn't take into account namespace => directory pairs.

When using Zend\_Application with a config file, you can specify "autoloaderNamespaces" config value composed of Namespace => Directory pairs. This triggers execution of Zend\\Application\\Application::setAutoloaderNamespaces which currently doesn't work as expected. Instead it could be refactored to use Zend\\Loader\\StandardAutoloader::registerNamespaces which is ready for this kind of behaviour
