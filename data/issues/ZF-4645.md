### Description

now it is not possible to set

 without using some extra java script. you could use

$this->body();

$this->body()->append\_function(event,function);

$this->body()->append\_function('onchange','setfocus');

generates <body onchange='setfocus;">

$this->body()->append\_function('onchange'foutje');

generates <body onchange='setfocus; foutje');

with $this->headscript you can give the java code!

Closing issue as it doesn't relate to any existing ZF component. A new helper would require a new proposal. In addition, this is easily resolved using a custom helper or by editing the local layout as needed.
