At line 305 Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract.http send use the header function. I think this code need to be in Zend\_Controller\_Response\_HTTP else Zend\_Controller\_Response\_CLI can't work.

Won't fix. The header logic is present so that if you re-purpose an HTTP application for the CLI, it won't break when calls to setHeader() are made (which will be sliently ignored in the CLI).
