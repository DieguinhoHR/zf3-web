Please provide a example for reproducation. (CSV file and short code).

Hint: Rendering is not done by Zend\_Translate.

You know that your csv file is broken ? CSV standard does not know utf characters. When you want to use them you need to have them within enclosures, otherwise the result is unexpected.

So you need to do "my Orig€";"my Translated€"
