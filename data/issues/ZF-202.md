### Description

The support for the underscore naming syntax of Zend\_Db Adapters (i.e. pdo\_mysel) was broken in changeset 829.

Also, Andi requested an E\_WARNING when adapter names are specified without the underscore naming syntax. After changeset 829, the warning is no longer the requested type.

I fixed 3 times, but the last changeset broke it again, so I can not close this issue.

I've looked at the changesets and I don't understand why so much trouble and changesets about so trivial an issue. Also, can you describe what exactly is broken?

Also, it's E\_USER\_WARNING, not E\_WARNING. We can't use non-user error types

E\_USER\_WARNING is in latest rev: [CS 839](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=839)

Can we resolve this now? This isn't really a 0.1.5 issue because the code is simply going to be removed by then

Fixed in changeset 839

Still broken.

See the original changeset for an example of working code: [http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/library/Zend/Db.php?r1=430&r2=792)

Assigning back to Gavin to finish for 0.1.5 release

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2006-07-07T20:48:01.000+0000

Fixed again. See FishEye link for more information.

0.1.5 released

Note: There were numerous commits repeatedly fixing and breaking support for the naming required in ZF 0.1.4 and prior - e.g. 'pdomysql'. Release 0.1.5 will support both 'PDO\_MYSQL' and 'pdomysql'. Release 0.2 will _not_ support 'pdomysql'.

Specifying PDO adapter names without underscores is now deprecated, and will result in an error of level E\_USER\_WARNING, if underscores are not used. Both the check for underscores and the warning will be _removed_ in release 0.2, after everyone has had time to update their code by adding underscores to their PDO adapter names. By convention, preference is given to using all capitals when naming PDO adapters (e.g. PDO\_MYSQL).

[http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/1539) - strict comparisons (===) are faster and preferred when semantically more accurate than non-strict comparisons

Directly accessing characters within strings will continue to be supported by PHP: [http://zend.com/manual/language.types.string.php/](http://www.zend.com/manual/language.types.string.php) <http://www.php.net/heredoc>
