### Description

I'm trying to remove a cache with a specific tag. the clean()-method returns true, but the cache file gets not deleted or cleared.

How I save the cache: Someone is looking at a database record over a controller, i'm generating a individualy cache-id with some params. I start a new cache block and call it with $cache->end(array('tag', 'tag2'); When I'm going to save the existing database record i want to delete the cache. So I build up a new instance of the cache object in my model, and search for matching cache-ids.

my code looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cacheIds = $cache->getIdsMatchingTags(array($this->getId()));
    foreach ($cacheIds as $cacheId) {
        $cache->remove($cacheId);
    }


I don't know what to do else? I think that is a problem with Zend\_Cache, r/w permissions are set cause i can write the cache on the given path.

Can you specify your Backend type and options? i.e. Xcache, Memcache , File etc.

$config = Zend\_Registry::get('config')->cache; $cache = Zend\_Cache::factory( $config->frontend, $config->backend, $config->frontendOptions->toArray(), $config->backendOptions->toArray());

I think this issue may be similar to ZF-5740.

I suggest the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = ($result) && $this->remove($id);


should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $res = $this->remove($id);
    $result = $result && $res;


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = $this->remove($id) && $result;
