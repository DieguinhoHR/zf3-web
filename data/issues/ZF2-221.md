### Description

The join() method in Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Select.php doesn't allow passing an aliased field name in the $columns parameter. The array should allow passing the fields as an associative array, for example array('aliasedName' => 'fieldName') ... It's very important in complex joins where some field names are identical and clashing.
