ZF-4601: Logging to FirePHP 0.1.2 stoped working
------------------------------------------------

### Description

After upgrading ZF from 1.6.1 to 1.6.2 logging to FirePHP 0.1.2 completely stopped working. After while we discovered that in FirePHP 0.2 (which is currently in beta) logging works fine. This may be related to ZF-4439. If FirePHP 0.2 is now required (which would be quite strange to introduce such dependency in minor release), there should at least be note in manual.

The ZF 1.6.2 release was planned to be compatible with FirePHP 0.1.2 but something slipped through the cracks. Sorry.

I was also planning on releasing FirePHP 0.2 at the same time as ZF 1.6.2 but it is delayed a bit. It will go out ASAP.

I cannot wait for ZF to release a new major version every time I want to release a new major version for FirePHP. I don't think increasing the dependency like this is a problem if everything is backwards compatible (which was planned but unfortunately not achieved this time around).

As a temporary fix you can change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    const PLUGIN_URI = '<a href="http://meta.firephp.org/Wildfire/Plugin/ZendFramework/FirePHP/1.6.2">http://meta.firephp.org/Wildfire/Plugin/…</a>';


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    const PLUGIN_URI = '<a href="http://meta.firephp.org/Wildfire/Plugin/ZendFramework/FirePHP/0.1">http://meta.firephp.org/Wildfire/Plugin/…</a>';


on line 108 of the Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp component. This will make it work with FirePHP 0.1.2 until FirePHP 0.2 is released at which point you need to revert this change.
