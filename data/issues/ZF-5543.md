### Description

I noticed log messages and profiler info doesn't show up in firebug when data is sent back using json helper. This is fairly big loss of functionality as firephp is most useful with XHR when content is not visible thus harder to debug.

I wasn't sure if there's some limitations to it, but it appears to be just overlooked. I temporarily replaced it with different implementation that works, so it should be possible to fix the current helper.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function direct($data)
        {
            $controller = $this->getActionController(); 
            $controller->getHelper('viewRenderer')->setNoRender();
            $controller->getHelper('layout')->disableLayout();
          
            $controller->getResponse()
                ->setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
                ->setBody(json_encode($data));
        }

Just put the following in your bootstrap:

[code]Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('Json')->suppressExit = true;[/code]
