### Description

It's not a normal bug, but rather problem with client application which sends bad mail headers (with additional spaces).

The problem is in class Zend\_Mime\_Decode, in method splitHeaderField, which returns empty string for header key, which is formated with additional spaces. This bug affect Zend\_Mail\_Part class so I cannot get message parts.

Sample headers (x-mailer: Microsoft Office Outlook, Build 11.0.5510) - additional space after "boundary":

content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary ="\_NextPart\_000\_3798.1087"

Possible solution :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    --- Decode.php  2008-04-15 21:24:18.606926208 +0200
    +++ Decode-changed.php       2008-04-15 21:24:23.654158912 +0200

             if ($wantedPart) {
                 foreach ($matches[1] as $key => $name) {
    +                $name = trim($name);
                     if (strcasecmp($name, $wantedPart)) {
                         continue;
                     }


or modify regular expression in preg\_match\_all

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

The space after the parameter name doesn't seem to be a valid character and I couldn't find a mail doing that (maybe it was spam?). But as it's invalid we can safely ignore it and it's now eaten by the regex.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
