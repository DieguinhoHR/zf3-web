### Description

Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract is a bit inscrutable in its variable naming of plugins, resources and pluginresources. Discussed this with Dolf in IRC and he asked for a ticket.

I'd also vote that "classResources" actually seem to imply the _opposite_ of what they actually mean. Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap uses this term for Bootstrap::\_init\*() resources, but I inferred that it meant concrete Zend\_Application\_Resources. Perhaps methodResources? initResources?

(If this ticket turns into a larger-scale refactoring of Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap, it's also a bit unintuitive that hasPluginResource() actually _loads_ all pluginResources, but there may be important reasons for this.)

This cannot be accomplished in ZFv1 without breaking backwards-compatibility. Zend\_Application has been removed from ZF2 (similar functionality provided by Module+Mvc), and so this issue does not apply there.
