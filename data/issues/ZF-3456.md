### Description

Hey!.

A view named "view-chart.phtml" execute the action helper, <?= $this->action( "show-chart-main-panel", "diagnostic", "platform", array( "patient\_id" => $this->intPatientId ) ); ?>, then the view of the second action ( "show-chart-main-panel" ) execute another action helper <?= $this->action( "show-record-image", "patient", "platform", array ( 'patient\_id' => $this->intPatientId, 'patient\_record\_id' => $this->intPatientRecordId, 'field\_id' => $this->intFieldId ) ); ?>, what's the issue ? the output of "show-record-image" appears twice on the "view-chart.phtml", any help ?

- view-chart.phtml:

### View Chart:

 <?= $this->action( "show-chart-main-panel", "diagnostic", "platform", array( "patient\_id" => $this->intPatientId ) ); ?> 

- view-chart.phtml calls "show-chart-main-panel" action, this is the view of "show-chart-main-panel" action, show-chart-main-panel.phtml:

### Show Cart Main Panel:

 <?= $this->action( "show-record-image", "patient", "platform", array ( 'patient\_id' => $this->intPatientId, 'patient\_record\_id' => $this->intPatientRecordId, 'field\_id' => $this->intFieldId ) ); ?> 

- show-record-image.phtml:

### Show Record

 

This is the final result:

### View Chart:

### Show Record

 

### Show Cart Main Panel:

### Show Record

 

 

 

"show-record-image" string is duplicated, any help ? Thx.

I can confirm the issue, and have worked out some vague understanding of the reason, and a solution.

It appears that nested actions prepend the previous response, or append the current one (depending on your standpoint)

If C actions B actions A

A results in A B results in ABA (should be BA) C results in ABACABA (should be CBA)

Blind digging in the code brought me to think this might have something to do with the fact that the request/response instances used in the helper are cloned in the constructor, and remain the same instances throughout the lifetime of the helper.

Exactly how this creates the situation above I have no idea, but creating new clones of the request/response objects (from the front controller) at the start of the 'action' method, and using them instead of the instance members produces the correct response.

I'd attach a patch, but I think someone who understands the issue would be better placed to produce something suitable.
