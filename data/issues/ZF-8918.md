### Description

Zend\_Json::decode doesn't throw an exception on failure.

Additionally the return value of json\_decode has changed on invalid data within ZF supported php versions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump(json_decode('invalid json'));
    // -> NULL


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump(json_decode('invalid json'));
    // -> string(16) "invalid json"

Added a patch for build-in json\_decode for php 5.2 & 5.3

Is there a chance that this could solve with 1.10 because in base of this bug Zend\_Serializer\_Adapter\_JsonTest::testUnserialzeInvalid fails on php < 5.3

Patch applied (with additional unit test) to trunk and 1.10 release branch.
