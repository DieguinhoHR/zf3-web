ZF-6043: support author field when building zend feed entries
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2009-03-16T12:16:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-13T20:29:45.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Building a feed allows for setting an author for the whole feed, but if there are different authors on different entries, it should be possible to set that when building the feed.

This can be fixed for rss feed item by treating author the way existing fields are added, simply adding these lines to the \_mapFeedEntries function:

if (isset($dataentry->author)) { $author = $this->\_element->createElement('author', $dataentry->author); $item->appendChild($author); }

Presumably something similar could be added to the atom feed class fairly easily.

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
