ZF-154: an invalid response causes an infinite loop
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-28T09:24:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:11.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.1.5 (11/Jul/06)

### Description

At Zend\_Http\_Response incubator version, extractBody method is written by following code.

 
    static public function extractBody(&$response_str)
    {
        $lines = explode("\r\n", $response_str);
        $line = null;
        while ($line !== "")
            $line = array_shift($lines);
    
        $body = implode("\r\n", $lines);
    
        return $body;
    }


But, if an invalid response with no blank lines is returned, it causes an inifinite loop. ex) [http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01133su/mt/â€¦](http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~s01133su/mt/archives/000259.html) returns response with no CRLFs

So, please check whether $lines is empty or not in the following loop.

 
        while ($line !== "")
            $line = array_shift($lines);

Infinite looping is now avoided in revision 771 - please test.

Note that the example server you sent uses juft LF as line breaks, which AFAIK breaks RFC compatibility (HTTP requests and responses should use CRLF as line breaks).

I reported another bug (ZF-183) to fix this, adding support for non-standard LF line breaks in Zend\_Http\_Response.

Until this "bug" is also fixed, you will probably get an exception from Zend\_Http\_Response when trying to read from servers that use LF instead of CRLF.
