### Description

Currently you can't specify what type of message you're sending with the FlashMessenger in Zend\_Controller. It's just a message.

I would like to be able to differentiate the messages I'm sending via FlashMessenger (e.g. error, warning, information, tip, etc.) so users can see more clearly what's going on. Therefore I propose to enhance the addMessage method of the FlashMessenger with an additional argument that allows setting the type of message.

Change: addMessage (string $message, string $namespace)

To: addMessage (string $message, string $message\_type, string $namespace)
