ZF-3939: Set Zend\_Dom\_Query document from existing DOMDocument object
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-08-12T14:38:28.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:10.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

In addition to accepting XML/HTML strings, the Zend\_Dom\_Query constructor (and setDocument\*() methods) should accept DOMDocument objects, allowing developers to use Zend\_Dom\_Query to query already-existing DOM objects without first converting them to strings. E.g.,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $domObject = new DOMDocument('1.0', 'utf-8');
    $domObject->loadXML('


`First paragraph.`


`Second paragraph.`




    ');
    $queryObject = new Zend_Dom_Query($domObject);
    $paragraphs = $queryObject->query('p.second');
    echo $paragraphs->current()->nodeValue; // "Second paragraph."

This usage would parallel the constructor of the PHP DOMXPath class.
