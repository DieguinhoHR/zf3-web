ZF-11990: minor version differences between 1.11.1 and 1.11.11 should not change functionality

### Description

we did a minor version upgrade from 1.11.1 to 1.11.11 and it apparently changes the ID and label values that have underscores in them. We use javascript (jquery) to manipulate items on the dom and this minor version upgrade broke that functionality. I feel that minor version changes (minor minor) in this case should not affect that type of functionality.

I just thought I would share my disappointment with this.

We strive not to have backwards incompatible breaks within the same minor version. If you are finding some, please provide examples of functionality that has changed so that we can either revert the changes or fix broken behavior. Good examples include:

- A succinct reproduce case
- Expected result
- Actual result

With this, we can properly investigate the issue.

Thanks in advance.

Thank you for the response. This is the specific issue.. In a form element subclass we are calling ->setMultiOptions with key=>value. Our key contains underscores. In ZF 1.11.1 the html that is generated _strips out_ the underscores, in ZF 1.11.11 the underscores are not stripped out. See screenshots.

class Mycricket\_Form\_Element\_BillToSame extends Zend\_Form\_Element\_Radio { /\*\* \* Set expected values upon initialization. \* \* @return nul \*/ public function init() { $this->setLabel('Billing Address'); $this->addMultiOptions(array('billing\_same\_as\_account'=>'Same as account holder address','billing\_new'=>'Different address')); $this->setValue(array('billing\_same\_as\_account'));

 
    }


}

I just realized I cant add screenshots.

In ZF1.11.1 the option button ids are “billToSame-billingsameasaccount” and “billToSame-billingnew” In ZF1.11.11 the option button ids are: “billToSame-billing\_same\_as\_account” and “billToSame-billing\_new”
