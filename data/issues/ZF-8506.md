ZF-8506: Zend\_Rest\_Server: Unnecessary cast to array in \_structValue()
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It is possible to return an object in service using Zend Rest Server. But in my application it results in an DOMException, because one of the protected properties couldn't be converted to a XML element.

In Zend\_Rest\_Server::\_structValue() $struct is always casted to an array like this: $struct = (array) $struct;

This shouldn't be necessary, because it is always possible to iterate objects with foreach. Especially when all returned objects implementing IteratorAggregate

I use the same service class with Zend\_Amf\_Server which iterate objects without any problems.
