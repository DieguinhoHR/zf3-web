### Description

I was looking through the code for Zend\_Db\_Table and noticed a cosmetic problem. It's not a standards issue, but if you wished to update, you could move all of the constants to align their equal signs correctly.

 
    const ADAPTER          = 'db';
    const DEFINITION        = 'definition';
    const DEFINITION_CONFIG_NAME = 'definitionConfigName';
    const SCHEMA           = 'schema';


could be .....

const ADAPTER = 'db'; const DEFINITION = 'definition'; const DEFINITION\_CONFIG\_NAME = 'definitionConfigName'; const SCHEMA = 'schema';

It just looks a bit nicer. Not a bug or anything though.

Cheers!

Added [code] tags to allow for identation to be displayed

Added HTML Spaces in constant example to elaborate on point trying to make about cosmetic issue.

We actually recommend this practice within the CS. However, it's optional, and often it's better not to introduce only cosmetic changes when doing other bugfixes, as it makes it more difficult to quickly identify which code is pertinent to the bugfix.
