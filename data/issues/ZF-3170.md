### Description

I just did an svn update and out of the blue the only thing I was seeing on my site was: Action Helper by name ViewRenderer not found

After some checking i found this code in Zend\_Loader:

 
    <pre class="highlight">    /**
         * Returns TRUE if the $filename is readable, or FALSE otherwise.
         * This function uses the PHP include_path, where PHP's is_readable()
         * does not.
         *
         * @param string   $filename
         * @return boolean
         */
        public static function isReadable($filename)
        {
            if (!file_exists($filename) || !$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {
                return false;
            }
    
            return true;
        }

I fixed it to: ``` because if fopen can open the file, than it IS readable => return true

this way I got rid of the error mentioned above.

// edit: submited it too fast :D // edit2: error appeared in trunk 9295: \* @version $Id: Loader.php 9295 2008-04-23 15:31:51Z yoshida@zend.co.jp $

But in my opinion this sollution is incomplete:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!file_exists($filename) && !$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {


So here is my sollution.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!file_exists($filename) || file_exists($filename) && !$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {


Brackets outside && are optional.

What do you think?

Because I've tested it in my application and it works.
