### Description

try running
-----------

$to\_normalize = "Mar 1, 2008";

$locale = new Zend\_Locale("it\_IT"); $date = Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate($to\_normalize, array('locale'=>$locale, 'fix\_date'=>true));

print\_r($date);
----------------

output:
-------

Array ( [date\_format] => MMM d, yyyy [locale] => Zend\_Locale Object ( [\_Locale:private] => en\_US [\_Codeset:private] => )

 
    [month] => 03
    [day] => 1
    [year] => 2008
    [fixed] => 0


)
-

as you can see, the DAY part is wrong, it should be "01" not "1" or anyway it's not consistant with the MONTH part

The date\_format you provided defines "d" as day format.... "d" is identical with the day number WITHOUT leading zeros.

This is no error, this is wished behaviour. See Zend\_Date constants for details about this helper function for Zend\_Date.

Not an issue due to constant and output are like expected.

Month is a other pair of things...

As said getDateFormat is a helper function for Zend\_Date which normalized date strings to numbers.

The month is ALWAYS two digits long... this is a prerequisit of Zend\_Date's internas and allows automatic corrections of false dates. There is a logic behind this behaviour but It can still be used as normal integer.
