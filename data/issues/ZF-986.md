ZF-986: Zend\_Date\_DateObject and date\_default\_timezone\_get/set()

### Description

Problem:

The function date\_default\_timezone\_get()/set() functions invoke PHP's error handler if the input is invalid. Either Zend\_Date\* should behave "correctly" with invalid input, or an error should be thrown, per coding standards.

Details:

When working with Zend\_Date objects, the date\_default\_timezone\_get/set() is used to regulate the timezone used within other PHP functions used by Zend\_Date\*. Both of those functions invoke PHP's error handler on invalid input. However, use of '@' to suppress error handling does not work as expected, when the developer has installed their own error handler bypassing the error suppression feature in PHP's error handler.

[http://php.net/date\_default\_timezone\_get](http://php.net/date_default_timezone_get) [http://php.net/date\_default\_timezone\_set](http://php.net/date_default_timezone_set)

Use of timezone\_identifier\_list() produces a 500+ element size array, which can be used to check input before invoking date\_default\_timezone\_set(). In our minimum required version of PHP #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL\_DATE\_SUPPORT wraps the function timezone\_identifier\_list(). Thus, we have no way of reliably predicting whether or not date\_default\_timezone\_set() will invoke PHP's error handler for ZF's minimal supported version of PHP.

Thus, using an older version of PHP without EXPERIMENTAL\_DATE\_SUPPORT enabled, and providing invalid timezones to Zend\_Date will result in PHP notices, if the developer has installed their own error handler.

In all other situations, Zend\_Date\* should be able to efficiently detect if timezone\_identifier\_list() is available and then cache the list (return results). Then Zend\_Date\* could throw informative errors on invalid input (when necessary and appropriate) for newer versions of PHP or older versions with EXPERIMENTAL\_DATE\_SUPPORT enabled. For example, if date\_default\_timezone\_get() fails (i.e. system is not configured with a working default timezone), then Zend\_Date\* uses its own default. However, for date\_default\_timezone\_set(), attempts to use an invalid timezone should throw an error, when possible (see exception above, where detection of the problem is not possible) instead of ignoring the problem, because the resulting Zend\_Date object will behave contrary to the developer's expectations (i.e. has the wrong timezone).

Is a unit test needed to help clarify this issue?

We already have a unit test for testing invalid timezone id.

It is not practical to use PHPUnit to test what happens when timezone\_identifier\_list() is not available, because we can't trap a PHP error using PHPUnit. So I would say don't bother to try to write a unit test for this case with our current tools.

This issue has already been fixed with SVN 3663 some hours ago.

For any who might search and find this issue, if you get the following error, then see "[Always Set a Default Timezone](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.html#zend.date.setdefaulttimezone)."

Excellent! .. except the result is not cached in a static class variable, and this code executes on the creation of every Zend\_Date object.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (function_exists('timezone_identifiers_list')) {
           if (!in_array($zone, timezone_identifiers_list())) {
                 throw new Zend_Date_Exception("timezone ($zone) is not a known timezone");
           }
    }
    $result = @date_default_timezone_set($zone);


Also, a very minor issue, in principle we should provide relevant data as arguments to the exception class constructor (see Zend/Date/Exception.php) so that the data can be examined algorithmically without need to parse the error string. I've added the data as arguments to the construction of the exception object.

Why are we using '@' with @date\_default\_timezone\_set()? If there is an error, when using date\_default\_timezone\_set(), why should we suppress the error without throwing an exception?

Because WHEN timezone\_identifier\_list is not avaiable then the error is suppressed if a user gives a false timezone.

Only if identifier\_list is not avaiable and the user overwrites the error handler we are no longer able to supress possible errorous inputs.

Why are we suppressing the error, if a user gives an invalid timezone?

Doesn't the resulting object behave contrary to the user's expectations, if the timezone was invalid (i.e. the developer made a typo in the name of the timezone)?

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-02-27T20:00:25.000+0000

P.S. I updated the unit test to work with the new approach of throwing an error when we know that the requested timezone is not available.

We can not change the $\_timezone to be static as proposed.

This would lead to the problem that ALL Zend\_Date objects are fix coupled to only ONE timezone. Now you can have a different timezone into each Zend\_Date object as it can also be done within php's date extension.

Now I can create a date object for europe and one for america... and both are calculating the offset seperatly.

Data as argument was changed already by you... btw: I dont see the benefit because the I18N classes are almost the only one which have this behaviour. All other Zend classes have it not... shouldn't there be a coding standard for all or none classes supporting this behaviour ??? This is of course relevant for a new issue.

A possible error will now not longer be suppressed if no date extension is installed.

Btw: I also reworked the useage of timezone checking... we now try to create a timezone object instead of checking the complete list ourself... this is much faster.

I only proposed caching the results of timezone\_identifier\_list(). I did not suggest making $\_timezone static. I think your alternative using [http://php.net/timezone\_open](http://php.net/timezone_open) is quite effective, better than the other alternatives above, and was reasonably fast in my simplistic benchmark test :)

{quote}"Data as argument was changed already by you... btw: I dont see the benefit because the I18N classes are almost the only one which have this behaviour.

Some ZF classes do pass data as arguments when creating custom exceptions. The ZF coding standard encourages this practice. Debate over this practice should occur on the mailing list and in comments on the draft coding standards wiki page: <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/PQ>

{quote}"A possible error will now not longer be suppressed if no date extension is installed."{quote} Yes, and I like the comment that marks the line of code that might result in an error. Since we can not detect or fix the error, and we can not throw an exception, it is better to allow the error to occur than hid the error from the developer, because the error is important and affects the behavior of the object in a bad way. Thus, the error should not be suppressed, so that the developer can learn about the error and remedy the problem.
