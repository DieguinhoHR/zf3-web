### Description

Several action helpers have a subpackage name of Zend\_Controller\_Action instead of Action\_Helper:

- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Abstract
- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_FlashMessenger
- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector
- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url
- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer

Also Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker which should be marked with the subpackege name of Action, and Zend\_Layout\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Layout which does not reflect the directory structure containing Layout as the second part of the name.

There are view helpers marked as Helpers instead of Helper too:

- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Doctype
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Headlink
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadStyle
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_InlineScript
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartialLoop
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract\_Standalone
- Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Registry

The complete API doc is actually being reworked. Also some of the things mentioned by you are already fixed.

I'm not sure which version the reporter uses but the "helpers" / "helper" should already been fixed. Actually I am reworking the complete API doc for ZF and I am writing the coding standard for it. This takes much time and is done since 2 weeks and should be finished in about 6 weeks.

As the subpackage tag is only a grouping and not a namespace, I don't see that naming like Zend\_Contoller\_Action is a failure.

This would mean that php uses "package.subpackage" syntax like java, which is not true. If the intention is to rework this for the complete framework it would be better to wait until I have finished the API doc standard and the dev-team gives it's ok to it.

Actually the complete API doc is not standardized and changing this only for Zend\_Controller is useless if not done for all and not consistent to the standard. This is the reason why I've not worked on this, because it's beeing worked on, but on another side. ;-)

I have reviewed all packages listed, and each have the correct subpackage listed at this time.
