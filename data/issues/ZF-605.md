### Description

When it comes to static routes current Route implementation is very inefficient.

Static routes are the ones that does not contain any dynamic variable, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('user/login', 
       array('controller' => 'default', 'action' => 'login'));


But if such usage is common then it probably is a good idea to introduce another Route object to handle these static mappings. So if you need power and variables, you will use default route; but when it comes to simple URL matching without any variable data, you could use a much simpler object - let's name it StaticRoute:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_StaticRoute('user/login', 
       array('controller' => 'default', 'action' => 'login'));


This should speed things up a bit. And, what's more important, it won't be any different than defining current routes. The difference lies only in the class name and absence of requirements (for obvious reasons). So if you would like to change an old route to new one, it should only be a matter of changing it's class name.
