ZF-5168: Zend\_Amf docs incorrect about source attribute of mx:RemoteObject elements

### Description

Under the RemoteObject code sample in section 3.2.1. (Connecting to the server from Flex ), the explanatory paragraph states that "The source 'RoundTrip' in this case is the name of our Flex application." This is incorrect. If anything but the server-side class name is specified, an exception will be thrown and displayed on the Flex side as an error similar to "Method 'hello' does not exist."

Thanks for the find. The source attribute is no longer referenced as it is not necessary.
