### Description

The following (around line 337) from Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard should be refactored:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
            $loadFile    = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $this->classToFilename($className);
    
            if (!include_once $loadFile) {
                require_once 'Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception('Cannot load controller class "' . $className . '" from file "' . $loadFile . "'");
            }


include\_once statement can generate a Warning if the file does not exists It should be @include\_once or check with file\_exists

I'm not able to reopen the issue ZF-4736

So, I clone it to say :

Hello,

This issue should be reopened because the include\_once statement can generate a Warning if the file does not exists. It should be @include\_once or check with file\_exists

Thanks to fix this

Cheers,

RaphaÃ«l Dehousse

Marco -- please modify this to use Zend\_Loader::isReadable() in place of file\_exists. file\_exists() does not take into account the include\_path, and as such could generate a false negative.
