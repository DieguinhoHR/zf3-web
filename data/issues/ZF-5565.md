### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Server line 730 (SVN):

set\_error\_handler(array($this, 'handlePhpErrors'), E\_USER\_ERROR);

Change "E\_USER\_ERROR" to "E\_ALL" so that I will be able to throw an SoapFault when a server error occures. So I will be able to overwrite the function "handlePhpErrors" in my Class "Ms\_Soap\_Server" which extends "Zend\_Soap\_Server".

With these changes it will be possible to return a SoapFault with a message like "sorry, internal server error" when an error occures in a function of a service class (database connection error).

Otherwise it is impossible to register my own error-handler, because Zend\_Soap\_Server registers an error-handler on line 730 (SVN). set\_error\_handler(array($this, 'handlePhpErrors'), E\_USER\_ERROR);

the problem why we cannot set this to E\_ALL is the following: The errors would by default be thrown to the userland code, which for SOAP Servers is a potential security leak.

What i am going to do is the following, i'll refactor the registering of the fault handler and move it into a protected method which can be overwritten more easily than the handle() function.

Added new protected method \_initializeSoapErrorContext() that can be overwritten by userland code.
