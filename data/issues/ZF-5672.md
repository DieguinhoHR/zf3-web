ZF-5672: Add a form check to Zend\_Validate\_Identical
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The actual identical validator can not handle Zend\_Form inputs. There is already a solution from Zym which we are allowed to integrate.

See [http://zym.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/â€¦](http://zym.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/library/Zym/Validate/Confirm.php) for related code.

Identical should also allow to check for complete arrays and see if they are identical.
