ZF-8793: "Class does not exist" exception thrown when methods have typed parameters

### Description

I'm using an extension to zftools based on this articl [http://cmorrell.com/web-development/…](http://cmorrell.com/web-development/php-modeling-in-zend-framework-360) to create my own model classes / properties.

Some of my properties have methods whose parameters are typed with other model class names like this

class myClass { public function myFunction(Default\_Model\_Class $param) { } }

When building this class from reflection, it throws the exception "Class Default\_Model\_Class does not exist".

I thought of either adding the paths to the application classes to zftools, like in the bootstrap (which I'm not sure how to do), or modify the CodeGenerator\_Php\_Parameter and Reflection\_Parameter classes to tolerate class names of classes that don't exist.

Here's a patch to have the parameter tolerant to unexisting classes.
