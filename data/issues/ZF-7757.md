The 6 basic types of routes that are displayed as a bulleted list are all showing up as 3 question marks ( ??? ). The links work correctly, but the text is not displaying correctly.

There are more sections of the manual with this problem. I found some in:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.rowset.html) [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.row.html)

Please note that using "xref" is not allowed. This element is deptecated.

When using "link" you need to add a descriptive text.

 -> displays ??? My\_Link -> displays My\_Link

Sorry about that. A new fix has been committed to trunk and merged into the 1.9 release branch.

I think ref/documentation-standard.xml should be also changed for description of the xref tag.
