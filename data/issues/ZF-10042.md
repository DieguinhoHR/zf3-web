### Description

Please add an option to Zend\_View allowing assignment of view variables when Zend\_View is constructed.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new View(
       array(
           'assign' => array(
               'keywords' => 'zend framework, php, framework'
               'pragma' => 'no-cache',
               'footertext' => 'MyProject (C) 2010',
               'somedata' => array('foo', 'bar')
           )
       )
    );


This would allow passing variables direct from configuration (Zend\_Application\_Resource\_View) to Zend\_View, like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.assign.keywords = "zend framework, php, framework"
    resources.view.assign.pragma = "no-cache"
    resources.view.assign.footertext = "MyProject (C) 2010"
    resources.view.assign.somedata[] = "foo bar"

Attach the right file, ignore View.php

Adding alternative way to solve this improvement as it was suggested in the issue description. (View.php.patch-alt)

Kim -- the patch can be made simpler: simply pass $config['assign'] to $this->assign() if it's set and an array. :)
