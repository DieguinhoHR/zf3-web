### Description

I have an action named getRecordsByCountryAction in my controller Admin\_CountryController. When i go to access this action, I get an Error:

Error has happened. Inside this application. Sorry about that.

Page not found (404)

Reason: Unable to find action "getRecordsByCountry" in controller "country" in module "admin"

But all the other actions with single word name are working fine, i have also gone through the coding conventions documnent of ZF and found myself right with convention.

Please help

You cannot use camelCase in the URL to request the action or controller; you need to normalize it to lowercase, using dots ('.') or dashes ('-'; this is the default and recommended way) to separate words.

In the case of your action, you would refer to it as: /admin/country/get-records-by-country. This will then translate to the method Admin\_CountryController::getRecordsByCountryAction().
