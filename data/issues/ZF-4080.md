### Description

by inserting an large text (greater than 5484 chars in ut8 charset, we uses "a's" as test character) into a database field Zend\_Db\_Statement causes an Apache segmentation fault the script dies in line 187 of Zend\_Db\_Statement without any exception to be caught

 
        // remove 'foo\'bar'
        $sql = preg_replace("/$q($qe|[^$q])*$q/", '', $sql);


We are using php 5.4.2 and apache 2.0 and apache 2.2 versions, and all versions are affected even if we use Zend Core php

This in interesting indeed. Can you help me reproduce this issue?

If possible, can attach both a file that has the data you are inserting (it can be lorum ipsum text of proper length), and then a php file that will demonstrate the issue in as little code as possible?

Thanks, Ralph

Closing as "not an issue"

Essentially, all queries passed to $adapter->query() are expected to be prepared, data bound and executed.

Considering you are building the full SQL in userland, this is not an intended use case of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query().

TO be able to do what you expect, try one of the following:

$sql = "INSERT INTO mytable (myfield) VALUES(?)"; $dbAdapter->query($sql, array($data));

Another options might be to use the insert() api:

$dbAdapter->insert('mytable', array('myfield'=>$text));

If you must pass in full sql, you might want to simply get the direct connection and pass it directly in:

$dbAdapter->getConnection()->execute($sql);

If you feel there is still an issue, please reopen.
