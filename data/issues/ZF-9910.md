### Description

We can use Zend\_Validate\_Ccnum in order to validate a variety of identification numbers with the Luhn algorithm (as an identification number for a company called French SIRET or SIREN). We loose this fonctionality with 2.0.

Can we recycle the code of Zend\_Validate\_Ccnum in Zend\_Validate\_Luhn ? I suggest to add the lengths allowed as constructor parameters.

Closing as non-issue.

It is not a bug that Zend\_Validate\_Ccnum was exceeded by Zend\_Validate\_CreditCard.

The new validator also uses the luhn algorithm, but is able to do further tests on credit cards.

When you need this validator for own creditcards, then you simply have to extend it to get the wished functionallity.
