ZF-11941: Segmentation fault rendering Zend\_Form after condition check

### Description

In certain versions of PHP (tested in 5.3.8) and Zend\_Framework (tested in 1.11.11), when performing a conditional check on echoing a form instance from Zend\_View, it causes PHP to crash.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require('Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php');
    Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $form = new Zend_Form;
    $form->setView($view);
    
    $input = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('input');
    $input->setLabel('Input')
          ->setRequired();
    $form->addElement($input);
    
    
    $view->form = $form;
    echo ($view->form)? $view->form : 'nothing';


If I change the last line to the following, it works without failing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo ($view->form)? (string) $view->form : 'nothing';


The segmentation fault occurs after the form has rendered in the shutdown phase of PHP.

Any ideas why? I can work around it as described, but it took me a while to track this down!

Honestly, I'd do this differently, and not use a ternary:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($view->form)) {
        echo $view->form;
    } else {
        echo 'nothing';
    }


Since you're not in a view script, I'd actually go a little bit more explicit, and do the following to render the form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $form->render($view);


Either way, the "workarounds" are actually the appropriate solutions.

The code submitted is a test version, quite dissimilar to the application, which has the ternary in a view script.

I concur and am happy to code it the verbose way, but for my own sanity, any idea why this would cause the segmentation fault?

I ran it with gdb but the backtrace meant almost nothing to me, looked like php was trying to unregister resources at shutdown though.
