### Description

Following bug applies to ZF2 (2.2) - could not find a place where to file this so here it goes.

In the prepare method of Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Driver\\Mysqli\\Statement the following line of code:

$this->resource = $this->mysqli->prepare($this->sql);

should actually be:

$this->resource = $this->mysqli->prepare($sql);
