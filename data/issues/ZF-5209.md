### Description

i having some trouble reading mails that have some missing headers. Unlike other classes it is not possible to check if a header exists. I found a \_\_get() method that throws some exceptions which is not very useful if you are using template engines like smarty:

{$message->subject}
===================

As mentiond above this throws a Zend\_Mail\_Exception and the rest of the template would not be rendered.

Maybe this is the way you want to use the Zend\_Mail\_Part::\_\_get, but then there has to be a \_\_isset Method to check if the header exists, without throwing exceptions.

Is that possible?

Kind regards, Daniel

A function "headerExists()" and a proxy \_\_isset were added to Zend\_Mail\_Part class

Sorry, not in 1.7.4. I think it will be released in next minor or major.
