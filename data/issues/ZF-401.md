### Description

As different logging styles are appropriate for varied situations, Zend\_Log should be able to support logging:

the log level value (e.g., "16")
================================

the log level name or string (e.g., "SEVERE")
=============================================

both the log level name and value, in whatever order (e.g., "16 SEVERE")
========================================================================

This currently affects the "format" option of the adapter classes.
