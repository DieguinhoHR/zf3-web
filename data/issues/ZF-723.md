### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $date = new Zend_Date(); // $date->_Locale is difficult to predict and will be different in various situations
            $locale = new Zend_Locale('en_Us');
            $date->setLocale($locale); // now a developer can assign a predictable (already known) locale to $date
            $this->assertSame($date->getLocale(),$locale);

Solved with SVN 2630 2 new functions were added:

setLocale($locale = NULL) getLocale()

Additionally now wrong locales can be detected.

setLocale('nolocale'); will return 'root'

setLocale('en\_XX'); will return 'en'

getLocale returns the locales identifier

Locales are now internally always Zend\_Locale instead of strings. This should reduce problems.
