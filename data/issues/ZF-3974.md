### Description

I am using trunk from this morning (EST).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // the message
    $message = new Zend_Form_Element_Textarea('message');
    $message->setAttrib('rows', 2);
    $message->setAttrib('cols', 30);
    $message->setLabel("Message (140 chars):");
    $message->setDecorators(array(
                         array('ViewHelper', array('helper' => 'formText')),
                         array('Label', array('class' => 'label'))));
    $message->setRequired(true);


Instead of a this creates an .

Maybe you could add to the manual as of why the decorator overrides the entire element. Maybe an exception would make sense? If people want Zend\_Form\_Element\_Textarea, but define "formText" helper, they could use Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text to begin with.

The documentation already states that the decorators implement their own render method and that the ViewHelper decorator option could be used to choose such a render implementation. To me it's straight forward that you get another rendered result when you choose a non-default ViewHelper.

Additionally creating an exception when using Zend\_Form\_Element\_Textarea with ViewHelper formText would only be justified if we added such checks for all other not-so-well-chosen Form Element / ViewHelper combinations. I don't think this would be wise for various reasons.

Closing with resolution "Not an issue".
