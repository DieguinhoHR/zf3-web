### Description

Hi,

I've just detected that the communication functionality based on xml\_rpc stoped working when I upgraded from 1.11.1 to 1.11.2.

I have now rolled back the upgrade to 1.11.1 again and things are working again.

At code level the problem seems to start at : Zend\_XmlRpc\_Response:\_\_toString()

It looks like the server is formatting the xml response wrong, for example;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    ArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArrayArray

I have the same issue, and have found out that the problem is a commit to Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value, which broke many amongst other things the support for structs (or associative arrays)

Se diff for a fix (not tested for all return types).

I believe that this issue already was fixed with ZF-8580 but not was merged to branch release 1.11. You could try reproduced with version of the trunk to confirmed this correction.

I did a checkout of the XmlRpc code in trunk, replaced all files i the 1.11 branch with the trunk files, that fixed it!
