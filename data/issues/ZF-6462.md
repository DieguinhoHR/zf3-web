ZF-6462: View adding extension to called resource / Docs wrong?
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-04-29T00:21:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-29T08:40:02.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.0 (31/Jul/09)

### Description

In the documentation for Zend\_Application, 4.2.3 suggests:

resources.layout.layout = "layout.phtml"

However, this causes: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script 'layout.phtml.phtml' not found in path

As you can see, .phtml is being added, removing the file extension works, but seems to be a contradiction in style. In either case it appears the layout loader is wrong or the documentation is wrong.

Using Trunk.

Fixed in trunk and 1.8 release branch; will update on site with 1.8 release.
