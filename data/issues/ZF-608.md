ZF-608: Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract does not reset headers between messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-11-30T15:47:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:30.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.6.0 (16/Dec/06)

### Description

This bug shows itself only when a default mail adapter is set with Zend\_Mail::setDefaultTransport(). If many mail messages are created and sent in a single execution, the Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract class will append each the heads of each message to the existing header property, meaning that subsequent mails will push header information into the message body.

A resolution was easily found - simply reset the header property every time Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Abstract::\_prepareHeaders() was called.
