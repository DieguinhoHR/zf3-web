ZF-11550: Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive does not true, when route is active
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Pls see below for routes.xml and navigation.xml.

When I go to:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <a href="http://www.example.com/en_US/default/index/index/">http://www.example.com/en_US/default/index/index/</a>


I would expect:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php echo $this->activeNavigation()->get('title'); ?>
    <?php echo $this->activeNavigation()->get('label'); ?>


in the View to output:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Home
    Home


as it does in ZF 1.11.7 and earlier.

In ZF 1.11.8,

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php Zend_Debug::dump($this->activeNavigation()); ?>


returns

 
    <pre class="literal">
    NULL


and it should return:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    object(Zend_Navigation_Page_Mvc)#54 (24) { [...] }


By overwriting the method Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive in ZF 1.11.8 with the method Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive from ZF 1.11.7 the issue can be resolved.

The issue, it would seem, is caused by the last fix in Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc::isActive in ZF 1.11.8.

This is a "Blocker", as it break the entire web site.

routes.xml:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    
    :locale/:module/:controller/:action/*defaultindexindex.*.*.*.*

navigation.xml:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    
    Zend_Navigation_Page_MvcdefaultdefaultindexindexHome
            Home

The reason this worked in 1.11.7 is because the route was ignored completely, and only the module/controller/action was checked.

However, changing the handling of the null parameter (for the locale in your case) will fix this issue (but I'm not sure if that is the correct thing to do).

Look at this patch on how to do that: <http://pastie.org/2203185>

I can confirm that in the case that I described, your fix resolves the issue.

Added a test case for the MVC nav page which failed prior to applying the patch, passed following. Merged to master and 1.11 release branch.
