### Description

Hi!

I have a little problem of useing an index in a 64-bit system. I created the index file on a 32-bit system and it works fine on the machine where it was created, on another 32-bit system machine and on a 32-bit server. When I copy this index to a 64-bit system and start a search I always get the same result, doesn't matter what was the word what I searching for. The first problem was I can't open the index, but I solved this problem with the solution what you suggest in ZF-4113, with this I can open my index and I can get the number of the indexd documents. Do you have any idea how can I fix this problem or maybe you already met this problem?

Sorry for my english, I hope I was understandable.

Thanks!
