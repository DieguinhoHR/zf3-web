ZF-4556: Checkbox, can't toggle anymore, wrong checkValue

### Description

In ZF 1.5.2, you could use a checkbox to toggle between 0 and 1. (Without specifying any values in your config) Now, in ZF 1.6.1, this doesn't work any more.

In the the static function, determineCheckboxInfo from the FormCheckbox viewhelper there is a check if the value !== null. Then the unCheckedValue will be set with the value of self::$\_defaultCheckedOptions['unChecked'] but checkedValue remains null. Later on in the function there is a check if the checkedValue is null and if so, then the checkedValue will be set to the value given to the function.

So that means that if the initial value of the checkbox is 0 (so checkbox is unChecked), only the unCheckedValue will be set with the default value. This means that checkedValue remains null and will be changed to 0 in the last if-statement. So this results in a checkedValue of 0 and an unCheckedValue of 0. So you can't toggle anymore because the value will always be 0.

It seems related to <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4274> but without the use of Dojo

For the moment, I changed on line 135  
 } elseif ($value !== null) { to  
 } elseif ($value !== null && $value != self::$\_defaultCheckedOptions['unChecked']) { to make it backwards compatible

I noticed the same behavior a long time ago as I updated from svn. It can be easily worked around by setting the checked value.

 
    <pre class="highlight">//in navigation checkbox
            $in_mainmenu = new Zend_Form_Element_Checkbox('in_mainmenu');
            $in_mainmenu->setLabel('in main menu')->setCheckedValue('ja');
            $form->addElement($in_mainmenu);


Because It can be so easily worked around, I do not think of this as a critical bug. Will therefore change it to major, although minor would be even better.

Will also try to fix it in the meantime, because it was a great feature that you could just toggle it without doing anything.

This is no longer an issue. If you create the most basic form, you will not be able to reproduce the error. Try this form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    /**
     * Loads all Zend Framework classes automagically
     *
     * @param string $className
     */
    function __autoload($className){
        Zend_Loader::loadClass($className);
    }
    
    $form = new Zend_Form('test');
    $form->setView(new Zend_View());
    $form->setAction('');
    $form->setMethod('post');
    $form->addElement('checkbox', 'mine');
    $form->addElement('submit','metoo');
    $form->isValid($_POST);
    echo $form;


This form will post to itself and populate itself as a result of $form->isValid($\_POST); It is perfectly able to toggle.

Now that I think of it more carefully, I noticed this behavior before and it still 'exists' if the checkedValue that you populate the form with is different from '1'. But that is by design.

Before 1.6 you could toggle it with ANY value on populate. Say you would not set a checkedValue in your config or explicitly on a class instance, you could check the box by passing in 'anyvalue' as opposed to null, false or 0 (I guess). That was kind a fun, but also a little unexpected.

So now you can only toggle by populating with '1', unless you set the checkedValue to the value you desire.
