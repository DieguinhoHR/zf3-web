### Description

I was following the ZF beginners guide, and had a lot of frustration because I could not create a new controller at all!

Tracing it back, I found that Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Abstract was adding an unnecessary DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR at the beginning of each directorynames it generated. Fast solution: @ line 126

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $projectDirectoryAssembled = DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);
    -->
                $projectDirectoryAssembled = implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);

You're a hero!

I stumbled upon the same bug when creating a module on Windows ("project was not found" error message). Applying the fast solution to file

library\\Zend\\Tool\\Project\\Provider\\Abstract.php

helped immediately.

I feel stupid for adding the substr first when I actually described what needs to be done just right, I must have been tired. the DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR is simply not needed on windows systems.

I am getting this error with ZF 1.9.3PL1. I created a new project like this:

zf.bat create project

Then I tried to make a module like so:

zf.bat create module user

I added the ZF library folder to my include\_path and it seems to work now. Sorry about the false alarm.
