ZF-3296: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer number mistake
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-05-20T04:08:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-27T08:07:06.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer::\_translateSpec() does have in my point of view a mistake

$controller = substr($dispatcher->formatControllerName($request->getControllerName()), 0, -10); Does change "Something\_Controller" to in "Something\_", in my point of view it should change it to "Something\_".

So I would suggest to change it to: $controller = substr($dispatcher->formatControllerName($request->getControllerName()), 0, -11); or to make it more understandable to: $controller = substr($dispatcher->formatControllerName($request->getControllerName()), 0,-1\*strlen('\_Controller'));

This hole behavior does not break anything in the ZF standard configuration as long as you do not change the inflector.
