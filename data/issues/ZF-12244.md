ZF-12244: Infinite loop if no error handler while error occurs in preDispatch plugin

### Description

There is an infinite loop condition if you set noErrorHandler on front controller and dispatch a request which triggers an exception in a controller plugin that uses preDispatch.

The problem is that the plugin broker will trigger setDispatched(false) upon exception and the front controller uses continue if it's not dispatched "Skip requested action if preDispatch() has reset it".

Meaning it will run the preDispatch all over again with the same request object, most probably triggering the exception over and over again.

This bug was introduced by the ZF-11561 fix
