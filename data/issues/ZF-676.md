### Description

The check for "readable" state is not performed by some of the methods in Zend\_Session\_Core.

Additionally, determining the source line# of errors thrown during write operations, when not in a "read-only" state, is more difficult than necessary.

Added missing checks, and improved thrown diagnostic messages.
