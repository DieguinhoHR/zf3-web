These helpers are found in the Zend\\Form\\View\\Helper\\ namespace, as they are form-specific view helpers. To enable them, you need to inject the view helper loader with an instance of Zend\\Form\\View\\HelperLoader -- examples of this are in the unit tests and the links posted to the mailing list.

Here is what i did into my module.config.php (I suppose that is what you meant):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'Zend\View\HelperLoader' => array(
                    'parameters' => array(
                        'map' => array(
                            
                            'form' => 'Zend\Form\View\Helper\Form',
                            'formLabel' => 'Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormLabel',
                            'formInput' => 'Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormInput',
                            'formElementErrors' => 'Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormElementErrors',
                        ),
                    )
                ),


That works. Thanks

Either that, or grab the loader and seed it with an instance of the form's.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $renderer = $locator->get('Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer');
    $broker   = $renderer->getBroker();
    $loader   = $broker->getClassLoader();
    $loader->registerPlugins(new \Zend\Form\View\HelperLoader());
    // or
    $loader->registerPlugins('Zend\Form\View\HelperLoader');


How you get the renderer is up to you -- but once you have an instance, you can seed it with more. It's best to provide it with the form's helper loader, as you can then be assured that as we add more form-related view helpers, they'll all be registered.
