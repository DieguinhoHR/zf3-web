ZF-4263: Zend\_Translate needs aditional cache controls.

### Description

Zend\_Translate is too strict in the way it caches data. It would be nice if we had two additional global options:

- boolean _cacheEnable_ Should the translation adapter use the cache. Defaults to true.
- string _cacheId_ Id to be appended onto the generated cache id to allow developers to have more then one instance of a translation adapter. Defaults to an empty string.

- cacheenabled This would bring exactly nothing. Don't add a cache and it will not be used. Generally you should always use cache.
- cacheid Also this brings exactly nothing. Each file is stored in it's own cacheid. And when you use a file in two adapters it would be nonsense to have it also stored twice when the data is the same.

Hi Thomas,

Please forgive the direct email. I can't seem to add comments to the JIRA issue.

cacheenabled This would bring exactly nothing. Don't add a cache and it will not be used. Generally you should always use cache.

The problem is that the cache is static so if it is set by something else then it automatically gets used. Without this option I would have to save the current translation cache instance to a temp variable, clear the translation cache (which from looking at the Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::setCache signature you cant do as it expects an instance of Zend\_Cache\_Core), then create the non cached adapter instance and then restore the translation cache.

cacheid Also this brings exactly nothing. Each file is stored in it's own cacheid. And when you use a file in two adapters it would be nonsense to have it also stored twice when the data is the same.

From looking at the code the cache id is simply the translation adapter name and is therefore tied to the adapter and not the translation files. I agree that it would be nonsense to have the data stored twice if the same file is used in two adapters, this is not what i'm asking. What i'm asking is to be able to have two adapters using two different files. Currently if the static cache is set then you can only have one instance of any adapter as the cache id is linked to the adapter class name and not to the translation files which they reference.

When you can add a disableCache() then you can also do a setCache(null); which is exactly the same or change the cache to a mock cache. But this are things from the cache and not related to translations. Generally such features, if needed, should be used across the framework and not only be added in only one component. Actually I see no benefit for a disableCache method.

And the id line $id = 'Zend\_Translate\_' . preg\_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\_]/', '_', $data) . '_' . $locale . '\_' . $this->toString(); shows you that you are wrong. The full path, filename and locale is used for the cacheid.

PS: Please comment always your issues so others can follow your suggestions and the complete workflow.

No need for this feature seen.

ID is actually directory-file based. And dis/enabling the can simply be done by setting a empty cache, null, or a mock cache.

Issue closed due to no additionally response.
