### Description

Missing a measure class for duration values (Zend\_Date is for a point of time ) e.g. Zend\_Measure\_Duration constants:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Measure_Duration::MILLISECOND
    Zend_Measure_Duration::SECOND
    Zend_Measure_Duration::MINUTE
    // ...


example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $duration = new Zend_Measure_Duration(90, Zend_Measure_Duration::SECOND);
    echo $duration->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Duration::MINUTE);  // display "1,5 min"

Interesting... the original definition included a Zend\_Measure\_Time... it seems to be lost somewhere between incubator and core.

And nobody asked for it or was missing it since over a year :-)
