### Description

The \_cancel class attribute in Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page should be protected. Any extension to Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page might need to know if the caching has been cancelled.

Original Line private $\_cancel = false;

New Lines protected $\_cancel = false;

An alternative solution would be to have an IsCancelled() or similar method.

Although this is marked as Resolved and Fixed, it does not seem to have made it into version 1.7.7. Could this change be made so that it does come out in the next release?
