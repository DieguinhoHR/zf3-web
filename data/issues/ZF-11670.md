### Description

According to the following URL, bulk document delete is now available in a single API call:

[http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/â€¦](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/12/03/amazon-simpledb-introduces-batch-delete-api/)

It would be good if this support was added to cloud and AWS functionality in ZF, currently a select must be performed, then each document must be deleted individually
