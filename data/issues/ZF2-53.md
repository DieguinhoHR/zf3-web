### Description

The following application config will not work as expected

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = array(
        'autoloaderprefixes' => array(
            'My' => 'path/to/My'
        ),
    );
    $app = new Zend\Application($config);


Because autoloaderprefixes config option is omited by Zend\\Application during construction.
