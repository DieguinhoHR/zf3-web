ZF-2805: Camelcased Actions are not dispatched right and will not be found
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

camelcased Actions are not dispatched right and will not be found. It worked in 1.5 preview. Looks like the formatter in Zend\_Controller\_Abstract lowercases anything before Action on dispatching and so the Controller is searching for ajaxrequestAction and the action name is ajaxRequestAction.

Please review the migration documentation:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.migration.html)

CamelCasing on the URL was never intended to work, and will not be supported as it causes breakages further down the chain when resolving view scripts, forwarding to new actions, and more.
