ZF-5865: return a new object for calculation methods

### Description

consider the folowing code.

$date = new Zend\_Date(); echo $date->toString('w'); echo $nextWeek = $date->addWeek(1)->toString('w');

The result is that the a week is added internally to the date and then the value is returned. What actually SHOULD happen, according to programming standards, is that the method returns a NEW date object, with the date set a week ahead.

It's pretty crappy now to make calculations. The calculations should not be supposed to alter previous set dates.

I never heard that toString() returns an object. Even in Java toString() returns a string and not a object.

I believe what this is after is making Zend\_Date immutable.

Though I'm having difficulties finding the "programming standards" the reporter is talking about.

When I have a date and make calculations I expect the calculations to take place.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date->addWeek(1)->subDay(2)->setYear(2008);
    print $date->getIso();


In the above case I expect the date object to hold the calculated value. Why should I be forced to save the return value to a new variable and expect the date object not to be changed ?

When I don't want to change the date object I have to clone it as within every language. This preserves the original object/instance.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date();
    $date2 = clone $date;
    $date->addWeek(1)->subDay(2)->setYear(2008);
    print $date->getIso();
    print $date2->getIso();

OK, here's some comment again... :)

1) I apologize for useing 'programming standards', I admit that the use of it is not correct. 2) I wanted to use the Zend\_Date in a calendar, and it's really annoying if you have to clone each time, just to make a button that refers to the next/previous daay/week/month/year 3) I didn't necessary mean to make Zend\_Date immutable after creation. That would be some kind of overkill, I think... 4) I don't see much benefit of add/subtract methods in this context. I would use setters for setting a state of an object (setDay($this->getDay() + 1)), I would use add/sub-methods for returning a new object. As a solution you could add another parameter (boolean) to the add/sub methods to tell whether it should modify the object or return a modified clone of itself.

And as a small side note: the source code of Zend\_Date is REALLY unreadable... :s (the \_calculate() method is about 1300 lines!) that's a pity (but this is a personal feeling, I don't know how other people think about this :))

The fact that you can't read the code of Zend\_Date and don't know how date calculations work internally has nothing to do with this issue.

Definetly no: The adder, subber and setter methods work always for the object. This will not be changed. Adding a day means that this object is altered.

There is no benefit for users to have 400 new lines just to have an optional parameter which changes OOP behaviour in a way which is a bad coding standard.

You could simply extend Zend\_Date and change the needed add/sub methods to return what you need.

Closing as won't fix
