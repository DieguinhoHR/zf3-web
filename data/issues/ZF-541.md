ZF-541: Review request headers order
------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2006-11-11T10:32:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-04T23:55:46.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

from the RFC:

{quote} The order in which header fields with differing field names are received is not significant. However, it is "good practice" to send general-header fields first, followed by request-header or response- header fields, and ending with the entity-header fields. {quote}

It might be a good idea (but not a priority) to review request headers order.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

This is also relevant to Zend\_Controller\_Response. Both components have methods for setting and sending headers.

This is obviously not a high priority issue because the RFC says order is not important. However, it is worth considering implementing a static function to compare header keys and call it via usort() in both components.

Added to Zend\_Controller component.

There's some difficulty with implementing this in the response object. Headers can take an optional response code, which means that headers such as "HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found" can be set by adding a '404' response code to the header. This means that you cannot necessarily sort the headers prior to sending. I assume PHP does this already internally prior to sending headers, but I'll verify.

Removing Zend\_Controller from components listed; not a controller issue at this time.

Just not important enough right now.
