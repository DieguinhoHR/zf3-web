### Description

I created simple application resource, which uses php's gzencode function to compress response body.

Everything works fine, but when I enable Zend\_Cache\_Page, I get strange characters before DOCTYPE:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    �������X��


and after

You probably just need to add, the frontend options:

'memorize\_headers' => array('Content-Encoding', 'Vary', 'Content-Length')

possibly other headers too, Content-Language and Content-Type are also quite common in the frontend options
