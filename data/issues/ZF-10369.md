ZF-10369: Default action set too late in dispatch cycle

### Description

Currently the default action ('index') is injected to the Request object only on `Dispatch_Standard::dispatch()` (method `getActionMethod()`), so naturally it's NULL before if the matched route doesn't specify it explicitly in its defaults.

It's NULL on all plugins' and helpers' `init()`, `preDispatch()` and similar methods (i.e. `ContextSwitch::initContext()`).

The solution would be to inject it on `Router_Rewrite::route()` method if a route match occures (probably method `_setRequestParams()` would be most appropriate).

If this suggested solution is regarded feasible for the community, I can provide a test-covered patch.
