 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-05T19:37:20.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-08-01T13:08:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.1 (15/Sep/08)

### Description

Zend\_Date does not support dates from strings with non-numeric timezones for RFC 1036, RFC 1123, and RFC 2822, but compliant agents must support at least some non-numeric timezones these according to the specs. It seems that Zend\_Date::RSS is currently identical to what should be supported by Zend\_Date::RFC\_1123 and Zend\_Date::RFC\_2822.

References: RFC 1036 § 2.1.2; RFC 1123 § 5.2.13; RFC 2616 § 3.3.1; RFC 2822 § 3.3, 4, 4.3

RFC 2822 does not allow non-numeric timezones: see <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html> §3.3 RFC 2616 is officially not supported by Zend\_Date RFC 1123 has been changed to RFC822 + 4 year regarding to §5.2.14 RFC 1036 has been changed to RFC822 regarding to §2.1.2

Note: These implementations are following the standard STRICT... this means when the standard defines "implementations should follow old standard because of redundancy" this will not be supported... use ISO\_8601 in this case or define the format manually.
