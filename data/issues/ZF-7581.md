ZF-7581: Sync trunk and release-1.9 branch (cs-17363 related)
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There was a commit ([cs-17363](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/tests/Zend?cs=17363)) which directly updates some functionality. As a result release-1.9 branch and trunk became unsynckronized.

Nethertheless, it's really nice improvement since it improves class docblocks and adds @group annotations for large number of files.

So it's good to merge this commit back to the trunk instead of reverting it at all.

Merging back has to exclude: \* tests/Zend/AllTests.php \* tests/Zend/Db/SkipTests.php \* tests/Zend/CodeGenerator/Php/\_files/\*

since they were reverted in the release branch because of some reasons

Direct merging [cs-17363](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/tests/Zend?cs=17363) into trunk already produce the following conflicts: {panel} C tests/Zend/Gdata/HealthOnlineTest.php C tests/Zend/Gdata/Health/ProfileListEntryTest.php C tests/Zend/Gdata/Health/ProfileEntryTest.php C tests/Zend/Gdata/Health/ProfileFeedTest.php C tests/Zend/Gdata/Health/QueryTest.php C tests/Zend/Ldap/AllTests.php C tests/Zend/Ldap/AttributeTest.php C tests/Zend/Ldap/ConverterTest.php C tests/Zend/Ldap/FilterTest.php C tests/Zend/View/Helper/CycleTest.php C tests/Zend/Tool/AllTests.php C tests/Zend/Amf/AllTests.php C tests/Zend/Amf/Contact.php C tests/Zend/Amf/ResponseTest.php C tests/Zend/Amf/ContactVO.php C tests/Zend/Amf/AuthTest.php C tests/Zend/Amf/TypeLoaderTest.php C tests/Zend/Amf/\_files/services/My/ServiceA.php C tests/Zend/Amf/\_files/services/ServiceC.php C tests/Zend/Amf/Resources/StreamContext.php C tests/Zend/Amf/ResourceTest.php C tests/Zend/Amf/RequestTest.php C tests/Zend/Cache/ZendServerDiskTest.php C tests/Zend/Cache/ZendServerShMemTest.php {panel}

So this files should be merged manually, then [cs-17373](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/tests/Zend?cs=17363) should be reverted for files mentioned above and committed trunk update reapplied to branch

Commit is merged back to trunk except files mentioned above. They still need manual merging.

The following files are also already merged into trunk: {panel} tests/Zend/Ldap/AllTests.php tests/Zend/Ldap/FilterTest.php tests/Zend/Amf/AllTests.php tests/Zend/Amf/TypeLoaderTest.php tests/Zend/Amf/\_files/services/My/ServiceA.php tests/Zend/Amf/\_files/services/ServiceC.php {panel}

1.9 branch is synchronized with r17681.

Thank you very much for doing the unpleasant work of conflict resolution on the merge. My apologies for not getting cs-17363 right to begin with.
