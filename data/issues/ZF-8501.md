### Description

For simple ACL implementations, this would allow the user to configure the ACL in the application.ini. Granted this could be easily done in the Bootstrap.php in an \_initAcl() method, but I prefer to keep most of my configuration in my application.ini.

Here's a sample application.ini for setting up the ACL.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    # Adding a role
    # resources.acl.roles.{roleName}.id = {roleId}
    resources.acl.roles.guest.id = "G"
    
    # Assigning parents to a role
    # resources.acl.roles.{roleName}.parents = {parentRoleIds} (multiple in csv)
    resources.acl.roles.user.id = "U" 
    resources.acl.roles.user.parents = "G"
    
    # Adding a resource
    # resources.acl.resources.{resourceName}.id = {resourceId} 
    resources.acl.resources.index.id = "I"
    resources.acl.resources.error.id = "E"
    
    # Add a role with a parent
    # resources.acl.resources.{resourceName}.parent = {parentResourceId}
    
    # Adding rules to resources
    # resources.acl.resources.{resourceName}.{ruleType}.{privilege}.roles = {roleIds} (multiple in csv)
    resources.acl.resources.index.allow.all.roles = "all"
    resources.acl.resources.error.allow.all.roles = "all"
    
    resources.acl.resources.users.allow.all.roles = "U"
    resources.acl.resources.users.deny.edit.roles = "G"
    resources.acl.resources.users.deny.delete.roles = "G"
    
    # When resourceName, privilege and/or roleIds is "all", it will be substituted with null when adding rules
    # resources.acl.resources.all.allow.all.roles = "all"


I've attached the resource to this issue.

After further discussion it has been decided this will have to go through the proposal process.

Please note that there's already such a proposal, and it is suggested proposers proposing the same collaborate. Having said this, chances are Zend\_Acl will be removed with Zend Framework 2.0, and therefore a resource plugin like this may not be that necessary.
