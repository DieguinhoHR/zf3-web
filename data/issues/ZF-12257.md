ZF-12257: Row's init() called to early in createRow()

### Description

I typically use Zend\_Db\_Row::init() to perform some row's initialization e.g. converting time stored in the database in a timestamp format (or just passed in such a format in db queries for portability) to Zend\_Date. Everything works all right when I use Zend\_Db\_Table::find(), fetch...(). The problem appears in Zend\_Db\_Table createRow() method. The code here:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = array(
        'table'    => $this,
        'data'     => $defaults,
        'readOnly' => false,
        'stored'   => false
    );
    
    $rowClass = $this->getRowClass();
    if (!class_exists($rowClass)) {
        require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
        Zend_Loader::loadClass($rowClass);
    }
    $row = new $rowClass($config);
    $row->setFromArray($data);
    return $row;


first creates row and then set it from an array. It means that when a row is initialized in init() it is not filled with data yet.

Perhaps a better solution was to merge the $data with $defaults and then pass it to constructor? At present a programmer is forced to override setFromArray() like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setFromArray(array $data)
    {
        parent::setFromArray($data);
        $this->init();
        return $this;
    }


to have the Row always initialized with data already set.
