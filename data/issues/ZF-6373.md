### Description

Currently ZendX\_JQuery uses <http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/> as the base path for jQuery as well as for jQuery UI. This wrong according to [http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/â€¦](http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/index.html#jqueryUI). The correct base path for jQueryUI is <http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/>.

It seems that Google changed the path for UI 1.7, i had it working before with older versions.

Inclusion from new path is fixed in SVN now.
