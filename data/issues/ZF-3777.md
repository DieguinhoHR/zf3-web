### Description

Hi. On my development box and my production server I inevitably start receiving the error below. The only way to fix it is to delete all files of the search index, and re-index.

I've tried with 1.5.2 and with SVN head.

{quote} Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated

The issue had something to do with the read\_lock file not being removed for some reason. I did an update of the SVN HEAD and the issue was fixed by r11040. This issue can now be closed.

It seems this issue is related to [ZF-3615]. flock() has different behavior on different filesystems.

Some lock processing improvements were done with [ZF-3615] fixing. That seems they also resolved this issue.

Please re-open issue if problem appears again.
