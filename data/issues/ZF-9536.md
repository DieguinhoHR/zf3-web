### Description

When logging accent using Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug, we get _NULL_ log in FireBug Console.

{quote} require\_once 'Zend/Application.php'; require\_once 'Zend/Log/Writer/FireBug.php'; $writer = new Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug(); $logger = new Zend\_Log($writer);

$logger->info( 'Un événement !' ) ; {quote}

In the FireBug console I get _NULL_ instead of my string.

Testing headers in zf 1.11.5 the header is correctly registered (with a url encoded value) if this is still an issue the issue is with the Firebug Console not the writer. Making as resolved - not an issue.

Output of my test:

array(3) { ["name"]=> string(12) "X-Wf-1-1-1-1" ["value"]=> string(47) "43|[{"Type":"INFO"},"Un \\u00e9v\\u00e9nement!"]|" ["replace"]=> bool(true) }
