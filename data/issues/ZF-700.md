ZF-700: Combining Components Manipulating Headers
-------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-12-29T18:11:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-06-15T13:49:22.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Any component which must manipulate headers before "output is sent" (per the explanations found with many of PHP's functions that manipulate headers) probably can not be combined during the same execution of phpunit, as most of these components would eventually result in output sent (e.g. the periods), and thus prevent later components from manipulating the headers, _unless_ output buffering (in php.ini) is appropriately utilized by each test suite.

Some people are reporting problems with the unit tests associated with headers, see [http://www.php.net/headers\_sent](http://www.php.net/headers_sent)

Use output buffering to solve this on a per-test-suite basis.

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.
