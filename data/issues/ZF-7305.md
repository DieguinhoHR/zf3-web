ZF-7305: Usage of track\_errors should be replaced by libxml\_use\_internal\_errors()
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I have noticed that when loading XML files the silencing ('@') operator + the track\_errors directive + the $php\_errormsg variable are used to suppress and detect XML parsing errors. This is probably a pretty bad practice for several reasons (performance, usage of a global variable which apparently sometimes xDebug suppresses, changing INI directives at runtime etc.).

For this specific reason, PHP supports a much more straightforward method to gracefully handle XML parsing errors - using the libxml\_use\_internal\_errors(), libxml\_use\_internal\_errors(), etc. functions. Those apply on both DOM and SimpleXML (and anything else using libxml) and are (at least IMHO) "cleaner" than using the track\_errors INI directive.

Patch applying this method on importString() is attached. This patch is verified not to break any tests.

I will apply the patch contents to Zend\_Feed\_Reader which is also effected by this.
