### Description

In some cases, in '\_\_construct', the head section of a Document/Html is not defined. So a fatal error appends.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Class : Zend_Search_Lucene_Document_Html / Line : 106
    (@version    $Id: Html.php 16971 2009-07-22 18:05:45Z mikaelkael $)
    
    ...
    
    // Remove additional HEAD section
    $xpath = new DOMXPath($this->_doc);
    $head  = $xpath->query('/html/head')->item(0);
    $head->parentNode->removeChild($head);                   <-- FATAL ERROR


A test should be done on '$head' to see if it's correctly defined before removing child.

Bye
