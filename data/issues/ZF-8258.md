### Description

Hi,

i'm using my code and it works with any problems. The code is very similar e.g. TabContainer's decorator and view helper (almost the same), i have only changed some settings and I didn't create new methods or some new code. The code is simply the same as TabContainer's code.

But I didn't create Unit Tests, because it's unnecessary for me, so if somebody create unit tests, this dojo decorator and view helper for dijit.TitlePane could be without any problems in next minor version. :)

I have create demo site: [http://zf.crystal-studio.eu/public/dojo/…](http://zf.crystal-studio.eu/public/dojo/dijit-title-pane)

Support for TitlePane already planed in 1.10 <http://framework.zend.com/roadmap/1.10.0> ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Dojo+-+Extended+Dijit+Support+-+Matthew+Weier+O%27Phinney))

That doesn't mean I won't welcome a patch. :)
