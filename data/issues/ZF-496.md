I made the documentation "home page" for each translation show the "Table of Contents" panel, so the "index" issue is resolved.

The coding standards in SVN are outdated. The wiki version of the coding standards already contains the most current, and authoritative version.

I updated the footers on all wiki pages to show copyright information, and Creative Commons license for sharing the manual pages.

The remaining itesm (list of tables and examples) are relatively low priority.

I have added the coding standards, and copyright information, as can be seen [here](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDOC/Home)

The change will be a applied to each translation of the live docs, as soon as the xinclude changes are made to the live docs. See issue [ZF-860](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-860)

List of tables, and list of examples are still on my todo list, but have low priority for now.

This issue has become irrelevant.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
