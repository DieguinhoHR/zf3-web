### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table::createRow($data) is filtering data that are not part of the column table while Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row::setFromArray($data) is not.

_Zend\_Db\_Table::createRow()_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $defaults = array_combine($this->_cols, array_fill(0, count($this->_cols), null));
    $keys = array_flip($this->_cols);
    $data = array_intersect_key($data, $keys);
    $data = array_merge($defaults, $data);


_Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row::setFromArray()_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($data as $columnName => $value) {
        $this->$columnName = $value;
    }


I found filtering a nice feature especially when you pass all the data coming from a Form as an argument.

Glad to see this has been reported; I was just about to post it myself.

I think Zend\_Form has made this issue quite a bit more important. My Zend\_Form objects frequently include submit button elements, which get returned back as part of the result of Zend\_Form::getValues(). This makes it impossible to use that returned array as the parameter of setFromArray().

Maybe, however, instead of changing the behavior entirely, we should make this "filtering" optional via a new argument for setFromArray(). The logic would go like this:

[code] public function setFromArray(array $data, $strict = true) { if ($strict === false) { // filter all non-column elements out of the array } // assign column values as at present } [/code]

This would keep things backwards-compatible.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

The codebase has changed a little since the initial report, but this issue remains. I've created this patch that moves array\_intersect\_key($data, $defaults); out of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::createRow() and into Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract::setFromArray() . setFromArray() is already called by createRow() so moving this line should make the two function consistent.

This patch works in a few of my own test cases.

+1 vote. Stephen's suggestion (moving the logic into Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row) works for me too.

Additionally, setFromArray()'s description is a bit misleading: ??Sets all data in the row from an array.?? It does not set all data (i.e. set unspecified columns to null), but only the given columns.
