ZF-7495: Add plugin interface to Zend\_Form init() and validate()

### Description

There needs to be a plugin interface for the global operations in Zend\_Form. For init(), there needs to be a preInit() and postInit() method. A common situation for users is to override the decorators globally. Currently that means calling setElementDecorators() after adding the form elements:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    class My_Login_Form extends Zend_Form
    {
      init()
      {
        //add elements
        //call setElementDecorators
      }
    }


A more convenient way that would fit with the flexible nature of Zend\_Form would be to provide a plugin interface for the init() method. So the user could create a global wrapper class, My\_Form and then provide instructions for all forms.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Form extends Zend_Form
    {
      preInit()
      {
        //set global form defaults, charset, etc.
      }
    
      init()
      {
         //this gets run if the extending class doesn't have an init() method
         parent::init();
      }
    
    
      postInit()
      {
         //here we can do stuff after all the fields are added with init
         
      }
    
      preValidate()
      {
        //add a default validator 
       }
    
      postValidate()
      {
     
      }
    
    }


Then the user could extend this class for all forms instead of Zend\_Form. If they didn't want the default for the form they could locally override postInit():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Login_Form extends My_Form
    {
        init()
        {
          //add fields, postInit() will apply default decorators to all with setElementDecorators()
        }
    
    }
    
    class My_Password_Form extends My_Form
    {
       init()
       {
          //add fields
       }
    
       postInit()
       {
         //override default decorator here because we don't want it.
       }
    }
    


This would add a great deal of flexibility and would only take about 6 lines of code in Zend Form.

Set component and auto reassign

This is a very interesting idea; can you please create a proposal for it so we can see if there might be other areas within Zend\_Form that could use plugin support?

Once you do, please close this issue.
