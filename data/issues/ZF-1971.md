ZF-1971: Add findRow() method to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract

### Description

There is currently a find() method, that will do a search based on the primary key, and return a rowset. A much more common use case when looking for rows by primary key it to find a single row, but there is presently no similar method that will return a single row. You either have to use fetchRow(), and specify the fields yourself, or use find() and then extract the first result (which there is currently no simple way to do, see ZF-1970).

Based on the assumption that primary keys are always unique, if someone specifies a full key (i.e. there is a value for every PK column) there will only ever be one row returned. Therefore, could we add a new method that will only accept a full key, and will return a single row object?

For anyone requiring this function now, you can extend Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract with this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function findRow()
    {
        $args = func_get_args();
        if (count($args) !== count((array) $this->_primary)) {
            throw new Zend_Db_Table_Exception("Argument count does not match primary key column count");
        }
        $rowset = call_user_func_array(array($this, 'find'), $args);
        if ($rowset->count()) {
            return $rowset->current();
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

bq. and then extract the first result (which there is currently no simple way to do

you could do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table->find($pk)->current();


which is simple enough in most time I guess.

@Geoffrey, Good point. "extract the first result" isn't actually difficult at all, my mistake.

I like your method, however I think it would still be beneficial to have the additional function, in order to enforce a full key, and ensure there's no possibility of multiple results.

Updated priority to minor since an easy workaround is available.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Should findRow() ensure that exactly 1 row was returned?

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-08-25T16:25:52.000+0000

I don't think this is a good addition. For a few reasons. If someone searches for something that produces more than a single row, taking the first off the stack is not good behavior b/c the developer would never get to know how many actual rows were returned. If someone can identify the behavior that would circumvent that ambiguity, ill reopen.
