ZF-1339: View Helpers to inherit escape functionality and text encoding from view

### Description

View helpers currently ignore the escape functionality defined in the view. They should instead inherit it so the user can control how data is escaped (if at all). Text encoding within view helpers should also be inherited.

I've added setView() to the base form helper (FormElement), and in all places where encoding was set to UTF-8, I've made a call to $this->view->getEncoding().

Resolved in r4803.

With the implemented solution, the view escape function is ignored with direct calls to htmlspecialchars. How about something like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Escapes a value for output in a view script.
     *
     * If escaping mechanism is one of htmlspecialchars or htmlentities, uses 
     * {@link $_encoding} setting.
     *
     * @param mixed $var The output to escape.
     * @return mixed The escaped value.
     */
    public function escape($var)
    {
        if (in_array($this->_escape, array('htmlspecialchars', 'htmlentities'))) {
            return call_user_func($this->_escape, $var, ENT_COMPAT, $this->_encoding);
        }
        elseif (empty($this->_escape)) {
            return $var;
        }
    
        return call_user_func($this->_escape, $var);
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Converts an associative array to a string of tag attributes.
     * 
     * @access public
     * 
     * @param array $attribs From this array, each key-value pair is 
     * converted to an attribute name and value.
     * 
     * @return string The XHTML for the attributes.
     */
    protected function _htmlAttribs($attribs)
    {
        $xhtml = '';
        foreach ((array) $attribs as $key => $val) {
            $key = $this->view->escape($key);
            if (is_array($val)) {
                $val = implode(' ', $val);
            }
            $val = $this->view->escape($val);
            $xhtml .= " $key=\"$val\"";
        }
        return $xhtml;
    }


The view code adds the empty() test which just returns the original data in case users do NOT want their code escaped.

The form element code shows how you can use the view's escape function instead of the direct calls to htmlspecialchars() which means that all helpers will automatically inherit view escape AND encoding settings.

Excellent suggestion, Jason; I'm implementing this now.
