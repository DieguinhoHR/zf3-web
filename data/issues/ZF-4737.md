ZF-4737: Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover / Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl Incorrectly places <soap:operation: tag
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl::addSoapOperation() is incorrectly taking the $binding as the first parameter when it needs to be $operation (as clearly indiciated by the doccomments as well). Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover also incorrectly passes the $binding as the first parameter (line 112) when it should be $operation which is defined on line 111. This can be further validated as incorrect by viewing the correct location for a tag at [http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#\_soap:operation](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#_soap:operation)

Buggy Code:

Zend/Soap/Wsdl.php Lines 274 - 285 --> Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl::addSoapOperation() defintion Zend/Soap/AutoDiscover.php Line 112 & 175 --> $wsdl->addSoapOperation($binding, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName());

Fix:

Zend/Soap/Wsdl.php

Old Line 274: public function addSoapOperation($binding, $soap\_action) New Line 274: public function addSoapOperation($operation, $soap\_action)

Old Line 282: $binding->insertBefore($soap\_operation, $binding->firstChild); New Line 282: $operation->insertBefore($soap\_operation, $operation->firstChild);

Zend/Soap/AutoDiscover.php

Old Line 112: $wsdl->addSoapOperation($binding, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName()); New Line 112: $wsdl->addSoapOperation($operation, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName()); Old Line 175: $wsdl->addSoapOperation($binding, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName()); New Line 175: $wsdl->addSoapOperation($operation, $uri->getUri() . '#' .$method->getName());

This is a duplicate of ZF-4170, which is fixed in trunk and will be included in 1.7
