ZF-9998: Zend\_Form "setAttribs" method overwrites "setAction" method when action is set prior to attrib

### Description

$this->setAction('/my/form/action'); $this->setAttribs(array('id'=>'form\_id'));

This combination will result in the form action attribute being emptied.

Simple fix is to reverse order.

Is this how it's supposed to operate?

Also confirmed that issue persists on 1.10.5

This is the expected behaviour. Zend\_Form::setAttribs() will empty all attribs before setting new ones. Zend\_Form::setAction() simply proxies to Zend\_Form::setAttrib('action', $action)

This is because the action is an attribute, and therefore should be expected to be set with setAttrib|s also

Awesome. Thanks Ryan.
