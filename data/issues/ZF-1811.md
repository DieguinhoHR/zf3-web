ZF-1811: Fail gracefully if hash extension is not present.

### Description

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http uses the hash() function, but does not check for presence of the hash extension. Even though this is a standard extension and is enabled by default in most distributions of PHP, we should consider checking for presence of the extension, and fail with an informative exception if it is not.

Graceful failure upon the unavailability of an extension applies to more than just Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http and the hash extension, since other components use extension functions unconditionally.

- iconv - Zend\_Currency, Zend\_Locale, Zend\_Pdf, Zend\_Search, et al
- mbstring - Zend\_Feed

I'm sure there are many more examples, too. Shall we search for such cases and create additional issues?

Attaching patch that throws an exception when the extension isn't available.
