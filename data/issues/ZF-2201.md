### Description

This is a simple function I use to get a parseable string out of for an AJAX call on the site. I put the die() at the end so that the header/footer are not sent to the client.

function getStatusAction() { $id = $this->\_request->getParam("id"); if (!$id) die(", No ID sent\\n"); $db = Zend\_Registry::get('db'); $stmt = $db->query("SELECT ds.\*, st.id AS st\_id, st.\* FROM deliverables\_status AS ds INNER JOIN status\_types AS st ON ds.status\_type=st.id WHERE ds.deliverable={$id}"); $res = $stmt->fetchAll(); // This is where i'd loop through the results to print out the list, but it never gets here. It crashes on the $db->query() line. print ", YAY\\n"; die(); }

This crashes Apache running : httpd-2.0.59-1.el4s1.8.el4.centos mysql-5.0.48-1.el4.centos php-cli-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-mysql-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-pear-1.4.11-1.el4s1.1 php-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-gd-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-soap-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-common-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-pdo-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-mbstring-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8 php-xmlrpc-5.1.6-3.el4s1.8

Could you post the error from your server log?

I'm afraid I no longer have access to those log files, I don't work at that company anymore. All I can tell you is that it was a standard Apache crash (core dump) error message... But I don't remember any specifics... If any relevant information was given I could have fixed it myself.

Was it using the Mysqli adapter?

Yes it was.

Were any of the fields LONGBLOB or LONGTEXT? There is a known issue (ZF-1498) where these columns cause Apache to crash.

No, neither were of that type... standard int or varchar fields.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-04-18T13:12:02.000+0000

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

I have a similar problem where Apache 2.x crashes on Vista Business, PHP 5.2.5. This happens when I try to update from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract inheritor. Zend\_Db::update works fine with the same query setup.

I think this affect latest trunk, at least the crash on update does, see my comment.

//works $this->db->update($this->\_name, $this->data,$this->buildCriteria($keys));

//crashes apache $this->update($this->data, $this->buildCriteria($keys, false));

Forget about my previous comments. The reason Apache crashed in my case on Zend\_Db\_Table was that I was calling $this->update() inside $this->update function. Stupid. It caused an infinite loop while calling itself. What I ment to do was call parent::update() inside $this->update().

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Is this still an issue? Was that 64bit machine by chance? If so I will attempt to create a unit test for this issue. If not, i'll close.

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-05-07T13:27:48.000+0000

Cannot reproduce this test case. If you have a simple db & simple use case code, please provide it.

Also, please note if this is a 64bit machine.
