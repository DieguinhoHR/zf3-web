                array( // rules
                    'man-bear|m-s' => 'ManBear with dash',
                    'man-bear-pig|b=s' => 'ManBearPid with dash',
                    ),
                array( // arguments
                    '--man-bear-pig=mbp',
                    '--man-bear',
                    'foobar'
                    )
                );
