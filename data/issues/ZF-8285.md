### Description

E\_ERROR Undefined class constant 'INVALID\_NETWORK\_SEGMENT' in: /var/www/ZendFramework/Zend/Validate/EmailAddress.php on line: 468

Line 468 is: $this->\_error(self::INVALID\_NETWORK\_SEGMENT);

I guess it should've been: $this->\_error(self::INVALID\_SEGMENT);

This component is unusable in it's current state.

Steps to reproduce:

$validator = new Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress( array( 'mx' => true, 'deep' => true, 'domain' => true ) ); $validator->isValid('blabla@srhwrhwrhtwrthwr.com');

EmailAddress within Branch 1.9 has not been changed since 22.July when 1.9.0 was created.

The class EmailAddress has only 265 lines, and there is no "NETWORK" contained in the whole class.

Please check your installation.
