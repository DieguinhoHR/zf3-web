### Description

H Zend Team, like i saw the Zend\_Validate\_Between supports only english float values like "2.09". It would be an good if it would support europe float convetion like "2,09". Here is my sulution: Replace isValid Mehtod by this:

public function isValid($value) { $this->\_setValue($value);

 
    $filter = new Zend_Filter_PregReplace(array('match' => '/\,/',
                                                'replace' => '.'));
    $value = $filter->filter($value);
    
    if ($this->_inclusive) {
        if ($this->_min > $value || $value > $this->_max) {
            $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN);
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        if ($this->_min >= $value || $value >= $this->_max) {
            $this->_error(self::NOT_BETWEEN_STRICT);
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;


}

Closing as duplicate

Note that the attached patch will not be integrated as it's behaviour is errorous.

Because of the $this->\_setValue($value); , or? filter than may fail?

No.. the preg\_replace itself would allow german numbers be validated in english environment and visa-versa. When we support localization then eighter all or non. The other issue was intended to add full localization. Therefor closing as duplicate and non-integration for this issue.
