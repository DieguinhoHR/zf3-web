### Description

Documentation crosslinks are shown as "???" instead of correct name. It looks like global issue but the living example can be found here:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.basic)

where we read:
==============

Rewrite Router comes with six basic types of routes (one of which is special):

 
    *  ???
    *  ???
    *  ???
    *  ???
    *  ???


 \* ???
=======

where ??? are links and supposed to be correctly named after target

now , I find the link tags without content as following.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     *

If it would not be build error, but need content, controller class names (or Default Routes) may be needed.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Controller_Router_Route_ChainDefault Routes

Similar problem example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    . 


in line 198, Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset.xml

But there is also no problem link.

 
    <pre class="highlight">


in line 32, Zend\_Date-Overview.xml.

It seems to be better to change tag from link to xref because of explanation in ref/documentation-standard.xml .

Using the element is fine... as long as text is provided:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date formats


If none is provided, however, it should be changed to , as that will inject the title of that section for the link.

Thank you for commentary, Matthew. I change 7 tags from link to xref. I searched with following regular expression :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    \

And fixed similar problem in Zend\_Date-Constants.xml Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.xml Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset.xml at SVN r18151
