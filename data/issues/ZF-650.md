### Description

We currently have in the product two components, Zend\_Service\_Rest in the core library, and Zend\_Rest\_Client in the incubator, which appear to do the same thing (though their code is not identical).

It would seem that Zend\_Rest\_Client conforms with our naming convention, and is an appropriate sibling of Zend\_Rest\_Server. This matches the pairings of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client/Server, and Zend\_Http\_Client/Server.

However, Zend\_Rest\_Client extends Zend\_Service\_Abstract, and Zend\_Service\_Rest does the same. Many of the Zend\_Service classes for specific web services utilize Zend\_Service\_Rest.

We should discuss this and come up with the right solution, and keep one class but not both. Having two classes that both implement a REST client is confusing and risks divergence of functionality.

If we choose to keep Zend\_Rest\_Client, then once it graduates to the core library, other Zend\_Service classes must be updated to use this class name instead of Zend\_Service\_Rest, and that latter class should be deleted from the product.

Reassinging to Matthew, who is currently the point-person for Zend\_Rest classes. Darby is the point-person for most Zend\_Service classes.
