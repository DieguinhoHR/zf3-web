### Description

When using something like

$this->view = new Zend\_View(); $this->view->addHelperPath('application/views/helpers/', 'My\_View\_Helper');

Then whenever the autoloader looks for a Zend\_View\_Helper\_\* it will throw an E\_WARNING

Warning: fopen(application/views/helpers/Url.php) [<function.fopen>]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory

This happens because Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() goes over all helper paths, starting with the user defined ones, and for each calls Zend\_Loader::isReadable(), which tries to open the non-existing helper in the user defined helper path

I believe it is resolved by re-fixing ZF-2985
