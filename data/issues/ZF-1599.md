### Description

Setting automaticCleaningFactor front-end option to true is bombing for Output frontend with Sqlite backend and only works on setting it to false:

Error: 2 Text : sqlite\_query() [function.sqlite-query ]: database schema has changed File : \\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\Sqlite.php Line : 355

Here is a backtrace with class/method names and line numbers:

sqlite\_query("Resource id #118", "DELETE FROM tag WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cache WHERE expire>0 AND expire<=1182199839)")

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite \_clean("old", Array[0]) 227

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite clean("old", Array[0]) 382

Zend\_Cache\_Core clean("old") 320

Zend\_Cache\_Core save( ... ) 80

Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Output end() 1258

can you try to drop your database file and retry ?

I've tried dropping the db file and noticed it recreating the file but it gives the same error for the first page load (cache-miss). Subsequent page-loads (cache-hit) are fine without errors. Here is my setup:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $frontendOptions = array
    (
       'caching' => true,
       'lifeTime' => 7200,
       'automaticCleaningFactor' => 1
    );
    
    
    $backendOptions = array
    (
       'cacheDBCompletePath' => '/temp/Cache.db',
       'automaticVacuumFactor'=> 1
    );
    
    
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory( 'Output', 'Sqlite', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions );

I've traced more info as for this error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Text : sqlite_query() [function.sqlite-query]: database schema has changed 
    File : \Library\Zend\Cache\Backend\Sqlite.php 
    Line : 127 
    
    [sql] => SELECT content FROM cache WHERE id='desc' AND (expire=0 OR expire>1183357534)
    
    
    
    
    Error: 2

The front-end used is OUTPUT.

HTH

Oops! Wiki markup got messed up. Here it goes again:

can you try to set 'automaticVacuumFactor'=> 0, then drop your cache db, then retry your test ?

thanks

 

 

Posted by Shekar Reddy (zendfw) on 2007-07-21T04:11:43.000+0000

I set automatic\_vacuum\_factor to 0, dropped the database and ran the test. It gave me an error:

No such table: tag

Then I refreshed the page - it went well. Then I cleared the cache and reset the automatic\_vacuum\_factor to 1 and re-ran the test. But the problem remains the same :(

Thanks!

You said it works well on your \*nix box. Have you tried Output frontend? I'm getting the problem on first page-load when the cache is empty. Once the content is cached, it's fine on subsequent page-loads.

TIA

Hi,

I've re-tested it and found the exact same issue as reported before in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite::\_clean():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($mode==Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_OLD) {
                $mktime = time();
                $res1 = @sqlite_query($this->_db, "DELETE FROM tag WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cache WHERE expire>0 AND expire<=$mktime)");


While debugging, the script exits on the last line above where it tries to delete from tag table. Running the page in the browser gives the following error:

sqlite\_query() [function.sqlite-query]: database schema has changed File: Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\Sqlite.php Line: 317

 
        $result = @sqlite_query($this->_db, "SELECT num FROM version");


Executing the above SQL statements on the Sqlite file run well without a problem. However, there are no errors on setting "automatic\_cleaning\_factor" to 0.

it seems that you have a sort of disconnection (parameter 1 is not a resource), I just commited in SVN something which may help (i don't know because I can't reproduce your problem)

After applying the SVN upate, I've noticed that I'm getting these errors randomly/rarely even on pages that are NOT output-cached!:

"sqlite\_query() [<function.sqlite-query>]: database schema has changed", "\\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\Sqlite.php", "364", Array[3]

sqlite\_query("Resource id #114", "DELETE FROM tag WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM cache WHERE expire>0 AND expire<=1193343468)") 364 \\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\Sqlite.php

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite \_clean("old", Array[0]) 217 \\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Backend\\Sqlite.php

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite clean("old", Array[0]) 337 \\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Core.php

Zend\_Cache\_Core clean("old") 272 \\Library\\Zend\\Cache\\Core.php

Zend\_Cache->save(...)

I work on XP, PHP 5.2.3, MySQL 5, Apache 2.0.5.

This thread seems to say that it's a vacuum problem :

[http://mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/â€¦](http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg04887.html)

Can you try to set (one time more) 'automaticVacuumFactor'=> 0 and try to reproduce the problem ?

probably fixed in SVN

Hi,

I'm currently traveling and shall try out the above and let you know by the end of this week when I get back to my win-box.

Regards,
