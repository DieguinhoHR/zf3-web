### Description

Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc requires the front controller's router to have a getRoute() method that is missing in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface

This can break an application using custom routers (such as CLI or cross application ones)

If we add the getRoute() method to the interface, then it ends in a BC break. But we can check the existence of the method in the Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc class.

According to your comment, I got a working patch for version 1.12.3:

Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc, line 175, I added the test for method presence:

if ($this->\_route && method\_exists($front->getRouter(), 'getRoute')) {
