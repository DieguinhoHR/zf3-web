### Description

I would like to add a method to fetch a unique row by primary key, like Zend\_Db\_Table::find() but instead of returning multiple rows the method will return a single row.

Could be named Zend\_Db\_Table:: fetchRowByPk() or Zend\_Db\_Table:: findRow()

so instead to do $album->fetchRow('id='.$id); we could do $album->fetchRowByPk($id); or $album->findRow($id);

which save a bit of tapping and make the code more readable.

What do you think ?
