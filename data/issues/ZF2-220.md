ZF2-220: Constructor of AbstractTableGateway.php fails
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-03-13T17:34:31.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-06-06T11:59:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

In Zend\\Db\\TableGateway\\AbstractTableGateway.php, we are not calling the parent constructor with the necessary parameters, so the adapter is never passed to the parent class. The constructor will fail if $this->databaseSchema has not been set in the $this->setup() method because $this->initialize() will get called, which in turn calls $this->adapter->getDefaultSchema(), which will fail because $this->adapter was never set. (because we are not calling the parent constructor properly).

Since <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1312> the API has changed and there is no constructor in AbstractTableGateway
