ZF-10605: allow use of database.schema.table in Zend\_Db\_Select
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Using database.schema.table (often needed in MSSQL) results in the SQL string outputting "database"."schema". It doesn't recognize the 3 part name. In this case, it seems to be an easy fix, just limit the explode to 2 parts. I'm probably missing the 'correct' way to do this, but I didn't see anything for the select statement builder relating to this.

 
    <pre class="highlight">`
    


protected function \_join($type, $name, $cond, $cols, $schema = null) { ... // Schema from table name overrides schema argument if (!is\_object($tableName) && false !== strpos($tableName, '.')) { - list($schema, $tableName) = explode('.', $tableName); + list($schema, $tableName) = explode('.', $tableName, 2); } ... } ```

Postponing. To be not an issue in ZF2.

I had this problem as well and used the $schema parameter to work around it.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()
                 ->from(array('t' => 'table'), '*', 'database.schema')
                 ->joinLeft(array('t2' => 'jointable'), 't.id = t2.id', '*', 'database.schema');


This is working for me on version 1.11.11 of the Zend Framework. But I agree it would be great for Zend\_Db\_Select to accept the database.schema.table syntax in the first parameter.
