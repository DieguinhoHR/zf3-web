ZF-9658: headMeta() modifiers

### Description

I am trying to make my XHTML 1.0 Strict validation and I get an error. I have some Meta Tag information that is in French while the rest of the site is in English.

XHTML1.0 requires that you declare the "xml:lang" attribute whenever you declare the "lang" attribute. However try as I might I can't get the headMeta->appendName() method to accept the "xml:lang" modifier, but it does accept the "lang" modifier.

Thank-you

sylvain

I think this should be a "Bug" instead of a "Coding Standards Violation".
