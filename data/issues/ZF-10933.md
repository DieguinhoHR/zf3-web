### Description

As discussed with Bittarman there's a bug that won't allow to set the \_rawBody property of the request. This won't allow to unit test POST requests for json Rest Store used by dojo. Please assign this matter to bittarman he told me he could correct the problem tomorrow.

Thanks

Which request object are you using? For unit testing, use the HttpTestCase, which provides this ability. If outside of that, please provide details indicating how you're using the request object, and the expected and actual results.

I missed the HttpTestCase, and it indeed fits the needs here.

Zladivliba, you need to set your request to be an instance of the Zend\_Controller\_Request\_HttpTestCase and use setRawBody() to set the data.

Closing as not an issue.
