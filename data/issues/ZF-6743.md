The last line of zf.sh may cause this problem.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $PHP_BIN -d safe_mode=Off -f $PHP_DIR/zf.php -- $@


It seems to have bad influence on MacOS Edition of Zend Studio for Eclipse 7.0.0 Early Access when creating project.

As a work around one can double quote the $PHP\_DIR/zf.php section in the file.

so this line should be altered to $PHP\_BIN -d safe\_mode=Off -f "$PHP\_DIR/zf.php" -- $@

Thank you, Roy. ;-) Solved in SVN r16195

The problem still exists because $PHP\_BIN should be quoted for spaces as well.
