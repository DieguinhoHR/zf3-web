### Description

I think it's not a high priority ... It's not a bug too, but I found that and I wanted to share :

in the function count and getIterator of the flashmessenger, ther is a use of

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    functions could be :
    


public function count() { return count($this->getMessages()); }

public function getIterator() { return new ArrayObject($this->getMessages()); } ```

That's it
