ZF-6935: Element\_Hash ignores own session on validation
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-06-05T09:09:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:32.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Element\_Hash uses Validate\_Identical for comparing the two hashes, but its only initialised with the hash-value when constructing the element.

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function __construct($spec, $options = null)
        {
            parent::__construct($spec, $options);
    
            $this->setAllowEmpty(false)
                 ->setRequired(true)
                 ->initCsrfValidator(); // <-----
        }

If i set an own session with 'setSession()', I must call 'initCsrfValidator()' by myself a second time, to replace the Identical-validator, so he will recognize the value from the correct session.

version is trunk 15895
