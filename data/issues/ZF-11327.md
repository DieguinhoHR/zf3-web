### Description

Today, developing the API (that is similar to Facebook Graph API) for a personal project, I ran into a limitation of the routes taken by Zend\_Rest\_Route. The limitation is that if I access a url like that: [http://example.com/module/controller/…](http://www.example.com/module/controller/id/resource)

The _id_ becomes a parameter with value _resource_, and that's not what I want, and I also guess it's not what other people want, therefore, with the modification that I made, the behaviors possible for the Zend\_Rest\_Route increases, and is as follows:

{quote} ||Method||URI||Module\_Controller::action Default Behavior: |GET|/api/users/|Api\_UsersController::indexAction() |GET|/api/users/:id|Api\_UsersController::getAction() |POST|/api/users|Api\_UsersController::postAction() |PUT|/api/users/:id|Api\_UsersController::putAction() |DELETE|/api/users/:id|Api\_UsersController::deleteAction() |POST|/api/users/:id?\_method=PUT|Api\_UsersController::putAction() |POST|/api/users/:id?\_method=DELETE|Api\_UsersController::deleteAction()

What I've added: |METHOD|/api/users/:id/:resource|Api\_UsersController::methodAction() |METHOD|/api/users/:id/:resource/:subresource|Api\_UsersController::methodAction() {quote}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    elseif (($pathElementCount == 3 || $pathElementCount == 2) && !isset($params['id'])){
        $params['id'] = $path[0];
        $params['resource'] = $path[1]; unset($path[1]);
        if($path[2]){
            $params['subResource'] = $path[2]; unset($path[2]);
        }
    }


I hope it is useful to someone, I do not know if what I did is totally correct, but the way it was, I could not get a request like this in my API: <http://www.mysite.com/api/users/12345/friends>

In my ZF apps I would have put the "User 12345's friends" resource at:

<http://mysite.com/api/friends/index/user/12345>

Which would go to FriendsController::indexAction() with user=>12345.

Sub-resource url's are a great idea, though, and I think we should try to implement them in Zend\_Rest 2.0 with ZF 2.0 orm.

Yep, but I did not want this _index_ in the url. :)

Sure. I'm basically in a holding pattern on the Zend\_Rest stuff until ZF 2.0 MVC is released. So, I'll probably just leave this issue here for triage post-2.0.
