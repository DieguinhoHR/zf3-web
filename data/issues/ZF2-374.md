### Description

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987>

Extend Zend\\Uri\\Uri with a Iri class that can validate according to the RFC3987 spec.

Requesting this since HTML5 Url element uses RFC3986 and RFC3987 for the browser validation, and it would be nice to have same validations on the server.

The URI's RFC is RFC3986

I had opened the bug report from testing it with HTML5 type="url" input which uses RFC3986 and RFC3987.

[http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/â€¦](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#valid-url)

Maybe instead of a bug, this should be a feature request to enhance Uri with RFC3987 support?
