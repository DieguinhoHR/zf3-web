### Description

Since there are checks if custom dispatcher object implements an interface in getDispatcher and setDispatcher methods, it would be reasonable to add setControllerDirectory to a dispatcher interface instead of the method\_exists call in front controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setControllerDirectory($directory)
    {
       $dispatcher = $this->getDispatcher();
       if (!method_exists($dispatcher, 'setControllerDirectory')) {
          throw new Zend_Controller_Front_Exception('Custom dispatcher does not support setting controller directory.');
       }
       $dispatcher->setControllerDirectory($directory);
       return $this;
    }


This way it will be easier to create a custom dispatcher since you don't have to rely on runtime errors to discover it's whole interface.

I totally agree with Michael. And more than that. IMHO there must be a getControllerDirectory() method in interface. It is useful sometimes :)

Sorry, didn't noticed that ZF-436 is about getControllerDirectory()... Anyway IMHO it has to be in Interface, so every, even manually written Dispatchers had this method... Or maybe I'm wrong....
