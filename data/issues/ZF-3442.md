### Description

Classes for SOAP clients may be constructed by IDEs at the development time. So it may help to skip WSDL parsing.

Creating a general purpose Parser for WSDL files is a first step towards generating Client Side code from it.

Creating clients for complex WSDL files is really a good idea, since classes for object parameters could be automatically created with the correct naming and stuff, saves quite some work. Can also be integrated as Zend\_Tool Provider.
