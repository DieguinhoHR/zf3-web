### Description

Using beta4. After using the forward plugin in a controller action and then returning a _different_ view model causes a resolver error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    class IndexController extends ActionController
    {
     public function indexAction() {
      $viewModel = $this->forward()->dispatch('SomeOtherController', array(...));
      .
      .
      .
      return new ViewModel(array(...));
     }
    }


The above snippet causes the InjectViewModel::injectViewModel triggered by the 'render' event to introduce a 2nd view model under the layout, which calls to a mangled view script made of the original action's name and the forwarded view script's directory name... which doesn't exist and so fails.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Zend\View\Exception\RuntimeException' with message 'Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer::render: Unable to render template "servers/web-api/index"; resolver could not resolve to a file


Note the path above - servers is the namespace, web-api is the name of the "other controller" and index is the action for the "current controller".

Work around - Return the forward's output view model. This seems to avoid the issue some-why.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    class IndexController extends ActionController
    {
     public function indexAction() {
      $viewModel = $this->forward()->dispatch('SomeOtherController', array(...));
      .
      .
      .
      return $viewModel;
     }
    }
