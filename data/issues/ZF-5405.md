ZF-5405: Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client fails with "Invalid XMLRPC value in response" when it encounters nil in response

### Description

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client doesn't seem to correctly interpret in XMLRPC responses.

If I return the following array to Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client from Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server, it fails with "Invalid XMLRPC value in response". The description field is blank.

Array ( [0] => Array ( [id] => 1 [name] => vertebra, caudal [description] => ) )

Here's the corresponding response body: id1namevertebra, caudaldescription

However, if I put a value into the description field, the response is parsed successfully.

Array ( [0] => Array ( [id] => 1 [name] => vertebra, caudal [description] => w00t )

)

And here's the corresponding response body: id1namevertebra, caudaldescriptionw00t

nil is not part of the original UserLand XML-RPC spec: <http://ontosys.com/xml-rpc/extensions.php>

Matthew, since it should not be a problem, we should add this extension or?

I started looking into this issue when posted, and my immediate response was the same as Benjamin's -- nil is not an official part of the XML-RPC specification. However, when I went digging into the code, I discovered we actually already provide support for it -- so it's a matter of determining why that support is not working in this instance.

Justin,

i have written a test-case for your example response with the nil response and get a correct NULL value for that.

I commit that into Zend\_XmlRpc\_ResponseTest, please check if you can change that for a reproducible bug test-case.

I could not reproduce the issue but I've added a test (Zend\_XmlRpc\_ValueTest::testMarshalNilInStructWrappedInArray()) to ensure it won't happen anytime again in the future.
