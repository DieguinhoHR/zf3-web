### Description

A new release of dojo 1.5 is available: <http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/dojo-1-5-2-released>.

Basically it's a backport of the patches availables in the 1.6 branch to fix the IE9 related issues.

I think that 1.5.2 version should be the default CDN version for the ZF1.12 release as long as it will be the las ZF1 release.

Forget this. I've asked to @dojo guys when will be the 1.5.2 available in the Google CDN and they told me that it was a long story, bug it will never happen!
