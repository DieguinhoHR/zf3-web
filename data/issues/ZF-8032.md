### Description

see ZF-7667 - due to changes related to validating the Twitter Service's "big integer", the passed argument is now filtered using "\_validInteger" in "Zend\_Service\_Twitter" - this, however, will return "0" everytime a screen name is submitted to this function. Thus, userShow() is not able to handle screen names as an argument anymore.

The same goes for "friendshipExists", where \_validInteger won't let any screen name through. Shame on you, dev!

...and friendshipDestroy/create... the list goes on and on ;)

This was an over site on my part. I have since fixed the regression and have added a unit test to gaurd against further breakage. This was merged into the release branch with r18495.
