### Description

When using the JsonStrategy to render your views and an Exception is thrown, the Exceptions' message is not visible as json\_encode is unable to encode the Exception object injected into the view.

Suggestions would be to either allow assignment of a custom ExceptionStrategy via the ServiceManager, or injecting the exceptions message itself into the returned ViewModel (see line 162 of ExceptionStrategy.php).

There doesn't appear to be a way to override the default exception strategy
