### Description

I'm trying to use TwoLevels cache backend in cache for DB metadata. I'm using default slow and fast backends (File and Apc). Here is a sample of code:

$cache = Zend\_Cache::factory( 'Core', 'TwoLevels', array( 'automatic\_serialization' => true, 'lifetime' => 86400 ), array( 'slow\_backend\_options' => array( 'cache\_dir' => '/www/cludisc/tmp/tp\_cache/dbmetadata' ) ), false, true ); $table = new TableClass(array( 'db' => $db, 'metadataCache' => $cache )); echo $table->find(123456)->current()->ID;

By first running when metadata isn't cached I get a notice "Failed saving metadata to metadataCache". I think a cause of this notice may be in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels->save() method. When usage of fast backend is too high and data is saved by a slow backend only there is a try to remove this data from fast backend (line 203 in Zend/Cache/Backend/TwoLevels.php). When Apc backend is used as fast one apc\_delete() function is called in this case (line 127 in Zend/Cache/Backend/Apc.php). But there could be cases in which this data isn't in fast backend. In this case apc\_delete() returns FALSE and save() method of metadata cache returns FALSE too as a result (line 825 in Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php). It causes generating a notice at the next line. As a solution of this problem the following patch for Zend/Cache/Backend/Apc.php may be used:

127c127,132

< return apc\_delete($id);
--------------------------

> $removableData = apc_fetch($id);
>         if ($removableData) {
>                 return apc_delete($id);
>         } else {
>                 return true;
>         }

I'm trying to decide if the patch is the proper solution, or if TwoLevels should just ignore the result of \_fastBackend->remove(). The patch adds some overhead to delete() (which is probably not much of a choke point.)

Fixed in r22736. Updated TwoLevels->save() to handle fast backends that return false for remove() operations that don't have existing keys (APC and File behave this way).

Includes test.
