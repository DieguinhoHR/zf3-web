### Description

Would be very nice to hide elements with visible false for the Navigation View Helper\_Menu but to allow it as visible (i.e. as Active page) for the Breadcrumb Helper. I would suggest an boolean switch within the Breadcrumb Helper to actived/deactived rendering of visible false elements.
