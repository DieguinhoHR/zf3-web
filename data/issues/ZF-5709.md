ZF-5709: File extension to MIME type database

### Description

We should have the database of MIME types with relation to file extensions in Zend\_MIME for use of various modules such as file transfer services, etc. It seems to be the most logical place to put such thing to.

This can be further extended by having finfo (file magic) interface which will guess file MIME not only but extension but also content. finfo is in standard PHP starting 5.3 but in PECL before that.

This could also help replace the getMimeType() method on Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3, which converts file extensions to mime types.

There's a great list of file extensions and mime types in one of the apache config files: [http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/…](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types) Maybe we could use that one.The last comment says it's in the public domain.

Beside finfo (which is part of PHP 5.3 IIRC) we can also use getimagesize().

I see how I get time to write a little guesser class. But I don't have a problem if anyone else is quicker ;)

It seems to be also one of issues for next major release like as ZF-1490 . Do you have any idea ?

I will note on here [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/Mail+sending+and+building+enhancements+2.0)

IMO, it seems to be better that we would submit a new proposal. Because I think this issue might be new feature rather than expansion of existing Zend\_Mime.

I expect the class name with Zend\_Filter\_File\_MimeType as one of converters about file's infomation, or Zend\_Mime\_Type as specialty handler of Mime types.

The class might have 2 kinds method.

1) Simple converter from file's extension to MIME type. for example, getTypeByExtension(). it may be required for getMimeType() of Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 (mentioned by thing2b).

2) Information extracter from file with finfo() or getimagesize(). For example, getTypeByFinfo(). Or we might substitute it by getMimeType() of Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter

I hope it could help you ;)

Note that Zend\_Filter is not the correct component for getting the mimetype of an file.

Detaching Zend\_Filter

Note that finfo is availalble also to 5.2.4 installations.

Zend\_Mime was designed ONLY for usage with Zend\_Mail. Therefor it is not used in other places of the framework.

Note that Zend\_File\_Transfer is ONLY for usage while transferring a file, and not for existing files somewhere in a directory. When you let file-transfer detect the mime type based on the extension as proposed abbove it's a VERY HUGE security risk.

The base question is, if we want to couple two components more together for a functionallity which is available within vanilla PHP installations. I would say no.

You say that "Zend\_Mime was designed ONLY for usage with Zend\_Mail." If this is the case, why was Zend\_Mime not called Zend\_Mail\_Mime?

Thank You opinions, Thomas and thing2b .

I will be happy if reporter or participants would submit proposal. Because the MIME type _database_ seems to be independent with the existing Zend\_Mime functions and also Zend\_Mail one.

Rather, it is required with other components. It would be better to ask review for many reviewers about the database .

I don't see why Zend\_Mime can't be used whenever we need to do something with MIME. What in Zend\_Mime prevents us from using it anywhere we want to?

BTW, having good list of MIME types for files can help mailing too, if you are mailing files. But doesn't have to be for mail exclusively.

So what the results of this talking? I'm also interested to have tools to work with mime, and as we all can see this tools implemented in wide range of components, and all this components has its own realisation.
