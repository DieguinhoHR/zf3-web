### Description

If I do: $server->setClass('ServiceClass',''); $server->setClassMap('com.zend.ServiceClass", "ServiceClass"); And then call it from flex as source="com.zend.ServiceClass" in RemoteObject, it would not work, since the source is not translated through class map. I think it should be.
