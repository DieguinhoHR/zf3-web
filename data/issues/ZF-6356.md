### Description

I'm referring to: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html#requirements.extensions)

1. Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql is said to use PHP extension pdo\_mssql. This one doesn't exist.

broken: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mssql.php> working: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php> (same convention for MySQL)

1. Instead Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql seems to use PHP extension pdo\_dblib.

There is no link to a pdo-mssql extension within the manual.

The original pdo-mssql extension is not from php but from microsoft and does exist. The dblib extension must not be used as it's wether threadsave nor does it support actual MSSQL instances.
