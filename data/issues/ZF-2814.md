### Description

Another thing you could do is create your own helper -- let's call it 'renderToPlaceholder'. It could work like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        <? $this->renderToPlaceholder('account/_signin_side.phtml', 'RIGHTBAR') ?>


and internally have code something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        class My_View_Helper_RenderToPlaceholder
        {
            public $view;
    
            public function setView(Zend_View_Interface $view)
            {
                $this->view = $view;
            }
    
            public function renderToPlaceholder($script, $placeholder)
            {
                $this->view->placeholder($placeholder)->captureStart();
                echo $this->view->render($script);
                $this->view->placeholder($placeholder)->captureEnd();
            }
        }


Place it in your helper path:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $view->addHelperPath('My/View/Helper/', 'My_View_Helper');


and you'd be good to go.

I created this issue for Matthew. He would know more about it than I do. It was from the mailing list.
