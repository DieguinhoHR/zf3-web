### Description

When you're using an array of data as the argument for the constructor when creating a Zend\_Date object in it's constructor it assumes that time to be GMT-time as can be seen in this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return $this->_assign($calc, $this->mktime($hours, $minutes, $seconds, $months, $days, $years, true),
         $this->mktime($hour,  $minute,  $second,  $month,  $day,  $year,  true), $hour);


When I execute this code from the manual I get a Zend\_Date object with the hour set to 13...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $datearray = array('year' => 2006, 'month' => 4, 'day' => 18, 'hour' => 12, 'minute' => 3, 'second' => 10);
    $date = new Zend_Date($datearray);


By instead specifying each part of the time separately, like in the following code, I will get a correct hour of 12 instead.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $show = new Zend_Date($input->show_yyyy, Zend_Date::YEAR);
    $show->setMonth ($input->show_mm);
    $show->setDay   ($input->show_dd);
    $show->setHour  ($input->show_hh);
    $show->setMinute($input->show_min);


I've tracked it down to the choice between the PHP functions gmmktime and mktime that is made within the Zend objects own mktime function. If I would be able to specify that the array isn't GMT-time so that the mktime would be used instead of the gmmktime - then the Zend\_Date constructor would deliver the time I expect it to deliver.

It would perhaps also be wise to have GMT turned off by default in the constructor - making the constructor behave the same way as the separate functions.

I'm sorry to say that again and again...

But the code doesn't work the way you think. Time and Date always depend on the timezone, the date and dst. And not on GMT or CET alone.

The problem you are seeing seems to be related to timezone and dst.

Please give us your \* timezone \* locale \* used SVN version \* OS for detailed reproduction.

Oh, seems like I left out which timezone I'm in. Of course that matters to determine why this error occur - because I'm getting what the time is in my timezone when the time specified occurs at GMT 0.

To clarify what I want: I want Zend\_Date to contain the same value that I specify and not to expect that I'm giving it a GMT time and I want it to be consistent and contain the very same value no matter if I define it as an array in the constructor or as separate function calls.

timezone
========

+1 GMT I think it is, I'm not the best at timezones so perhaps +2 now during summertime or something.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    # locale


setlocale(LC\_ALL, array('sve', 'swe')); Zend\_Locale\_Format::setOptions(array('locale' => 'sv\_SE')); ```

used SVN version
================

Hmm, well I'm using the 1.0.1 release. I hope it's okay to submit issues anyway - I checked and didn't see any existing issue about this matter now r in the past.

OS
==

Swedish XP SP2 under wish I'm running a rather new version of XAMPP with new versions of both Apache and PHP although not the newest.

I was able to reproduce a misinterpreted behaviour with the data you provided related to CET instead of CEST set.

Please check out SVN 6511 where this error is fixed and give us response.

I have tried that revision of Zend\_Date and it worked correctly.

I don't understand what "related to CET instead of CEST set." really is meaning but I can tell for the record that now when I tested this it gave the same errors with the old file no matter if I set the timezone in my php-file or not. It worked correctly with this new file also no matter if I specified it in my php-file. On the other hand - it might be that those settings I make in the php-files alreade are made by default because of the language of my OS or something - I don't know, I'm just telling what I see.

Good job solving this so fast btw. I'm sorry I couldn't test it earlier!
