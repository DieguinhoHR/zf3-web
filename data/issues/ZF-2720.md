### Description

Please define where to place class propeties and constants.

IÂ´ve found classes where constants and properties are declared between the methods. I think constants and properties should be declared above the first method declaration.

Example: Zend/Lucene.php

This is done by the new ZF coding standard. Also the new testbed we created returns an error if such things are done.

The problem itself will be fixed as soon as the testbed is official released.
