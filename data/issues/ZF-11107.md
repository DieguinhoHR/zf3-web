### Description

I was working with Zend\_Form and I needed to disable the translation for all form's elements. I tried using Zend\_Form::setDisableTranslator but it seems that the propagation do not occur to the elements. I know I can disable the translation per element, but my first thought about Zend\_Form::setDisableTranslator was that it could do the job in a global scope. But checking the source, it not happens. When an element try to get the translator object, it calls Zend\_Form::getDefaultTranslator and in this method no check is made to see if "translatorIsDisabled", but what I get, is the global instance registered in Zend\_Registry.

Is there a way where I can globally disable Zend\_Form's (and all elements) automatic translation?

If no... it's a good idea, isn't it? The implementation could be done on Zend\_Form::createElement, where Zend\_Form\_Element::setDisableTranslator will be the same of Zend\_Form's value only if this option doesn't exists in the options array.
