### Description

The Zend\_Validate\_Hostname constructor takes a bitwise value to determine what checks to perform on the passed values.

If you instance the constructor with:

$validator = new Zend\_Validate\_Hostname( Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::ALLOW\_DNS );

and then check a value of:

'foobar'

the validator throws two errors instead of one error.

The first error (self::INVALID\_HOSTNAME) is expected and the desired result, since we passed in ALLOW\_DNS to our constructor. The second error however should not be triggered (self::LOCAL\_NAME\_NOT\_ALLOWED) because we did not want to allow hostname checks because we specifically didn't include them in the constructor.

The bitwise approach is a good idea for this validator, however throwing errors for checks that we didn't even want in the first place seems a bit outside the norm for how a validator is supposed to work.

I have worked around this particular behavior by wrapping each logic check ("Check input against IP address", etc ) with:

if( ($this->\_allow & self::ALLOW\_IP) ) {

This will cut down on the processing time spent on results that are not desired anyways, as well as suppress errors for checks that are not allowed.

I have worked around this by extending the Zend\_Validate\_Hostname validator with my own and duplicating the isValid() method.

I should also note that by extending the class with my own, there are two parent class variables that are marked private and do not extend into the child class ($\_validateIdn and $\_validateTld). I do not see any reason for these two variables to be marked private.

The reason could be that these variables don't exist anymore within trunk.

You can not simply switch off the logic by wrapping as this would negotate existing behaviour.

Example: A given hostname could also consist of IP numbers instead of a hostname. By stripping of the IP check you would allow IP addresses when you set only DNS because a hostname can have digits. The DNS check does of course not check if an IP is given.

This is not intended behaviour.

Closing as non-issue.

DNS has been set, but a LDN has been given. In this special case both messages are valid.

You can override this behaviour by \* allowing local domainnames \* setting the error message to '' \* translating the message to something comfortable
