### Description

line 230+ (\_prepareDijit function, just before the return) : if you are using Declarative, the bool attribs arent converted to string, so e.g.: if you are using a filteringselect with autocomplete set to false, only: autocomplete="" will show up in the source code.

after i added the line: array\_walk\_recursive($attribs, array($this, '\_castBoolToString')); all worked fine
