### Description

I receive the following error when sending to a particular mail exchange

bq. 5.1.0 - Unknown address error 550-'Rejected after DATA: missing or malformed local part (expected word or\\n"<"): failing address in "To" header is:\\nDave Marshall [Director] [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)

From what I can see here <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#page-13>, the following characters should force the name part to be quoted:

"(", ")", "<", ">", "[", "]", ":", ";", "@", "\\", ",", "."

Feel free to reject this if I've misinterpreted the RFC!

This patch seems to work well. Does someone want to commit this?
