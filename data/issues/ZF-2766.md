### Description

Zend\_Form has the function setOptions, it would be nice to be able to pull the array back out for storage (such as in a database) or to modify it in array form without using objects.

setOptions() and setConfig() are used to set object state. In the process, many objects are created, including filters, validators, elements, and decorators. Adding a getOptions() method simply is not a feasible task, nor one that would provide much benefit.
