### Description

\_\_construct causes exception throw when element's name specified only in init() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($spec, $options = null)
        {
            //skipped
    
            if (null === $this->getName()) {
                require_once 'Zend/Form/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Form_Exception('Zend_Form_Element requires each element to have a name');
            }
    
            /**
             * Extensions
             */
            $this->init();
    
            //skipped
        }


I believe init() call should be before checking element's name:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($spec, $options = null)
        {
            //skipped
    
    
            /**
             * Extensions
             */
            $this->init();
    
            if (null === $this->getName()) {
                require_once 'Zend/Form/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Form_Exception('Zend_Form_Element requires each element to have a name');
            }
    
            //skipped
        }

What problem would this solve, exactly? The logic is there to assure that a name is provided at instantiation, and hardcoding via init() would make the element non-reusable (as you would not be able to specify an alternate name).

Elements names bound to parameters names in my model so i assumed hardcoding them in subclass is appropriate way. I see now where i was wrong. I'm new to OOP and not familiar enough with it's ideology.

This issue can be closed as "not a bug"

I can imagine some people do want to hardcode a name. To do so, you can just inherit \_\_construct() and set a name before calling the parent.
