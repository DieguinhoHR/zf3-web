### Description

I have a config.ini file in which i use 0 as a property/key name. Until now i was using zend framework 1.5.2, but i'm now updating.

The problem appeared with version 1.8.2 and upwards. I think it is connected to the fix of ZF-5800 (SVN r14667).

In my config.ini, i have something similar to the following:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    foo.bar.1.bar=ff3f00
    foo.bar.1.font=fefbf7
    foo.bar.0.bar=ff2b00
    foo.bar.0.font=ffff


But when i load this and convert it to an Array i get this:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        [foo] => Array
            (
                [bar] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => Array
                            (
                              
    
                                [1] => Array
                                    (
                                        [bar] => ff3f00
                                        [font] => fefbf7
                                    )
    
                                [bar] => ff2b00
                                [font] => ffffff
                            )
                    )
            )


Instead i would expect something like that:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        [foo] => Array
            (
                [bar] => Array
                    (
    
                        [1] => Array
                            (
                                [bar] => ff3f00
                                [font] => fefbf7
                            )
    
                        [0] => Array
                            (
                                [bar] => ff2b00
                                [font] => ffffff
                            )  
                    )
            )


The "real" code is a bit longer, but this is what it needs to be reproduced. When 0/zero is the last property name, i have no problem.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    foo.bar.1=ff3f00
    foo.bar.0=ff2b00


I think this is a bug, but easy to workaround by prefixing the numbers.

It seems this only happens because you have the index reversed (1 comes before 0 in your ini). A simple fix for you would be to put the 0 index first. I've attached a unit test that covers both variations.

This issue won't be fixed as there is the simple workaround of placing your index numbers in the correct order.
