### Description

"By default, Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader does no error suppression when using its internal autoloader, which utilizes Zend\_Loader::loadClass(). Most of the time, this is exactly what you want. However, there may be cases where you want to suppress them. You can do this using suppressNotFoundWarnings()"

/\*\* \* @var bool Whether or not to suppress file not found warnings \*/ protected $\_suppressNotFoundWarnings = true;
