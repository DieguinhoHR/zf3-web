If you post a patch file this can get fixed faster. I will look at once a proper patch file is submitted.

Solved in SVN r13857

I think statusFriendsTimeline() and favoriteFavorites() have also same problem, and I fixed.

I changed as following.

$this->page to $\_params['page']

$this->since\_id to $\_params['since\_id']

and adds second parameter to restGet() if needed.

When you posted this to trunk did you also merge it into the 1.7 branch?

 

 

Posted by Jon Whitcraft (sidhighwind) on 2009-02-06T08:56:43.000+0000

This was merged into the 1.7 release branch with r13994
