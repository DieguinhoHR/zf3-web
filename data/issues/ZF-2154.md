ZF-2154: formLabel should be "for" ID, not NAME
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-11-05T20:41:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-26T12:56:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.4 (26/Feb/08)

### Description

The "for" attribute of the formLabel view helper is populated with the name parameter it is given, however, the "for" attribute should reference the ID attribute of its related form field ([http://w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/abstract_modules.html#s_forms)).

This is not much of an issue using the default components as NAME is generally equal to ID, but when overriding the Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement::getInfo() function to use a different algorithm to generate IDs (for example to remove illegal "[" & "]" characters) the connection between the label and the form field breaks.
