ZF-10358: Zend\_Date improperly recognize year when date with custom format is created
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There is an issue while creating new Zend\_Date with specific format being set, in this case Twitter-specific date format (in which is e.g. 'created\_at' field of zend\_service\_twitter response).

The date in its pure form is eg. "Sat Aug 21 18:50:20 +0000 2010", which corresponds to the format "EEE MMM d H:m:s ZZZ yyy" in en\_US locale.

Example: $date = new Zend\_Date("Sat Aug 21 18:50:20 +0000 2010", 'EEE MMM d H:m:s ZZZ yyy', 'en\_US'); echo $date->get(Zend\_Date::ISO\_8601);

Expected output: 2010-08-21T18:50:20+00:00

Current output: 2000-08-21T18:50:20+00:00 // the year is 2000 instead of 2010

Shouldn't it read $date = new Zend\_Date("Sat Aug 21 18:50:20 +0000 2010", "EEE MMM d H:m:s ZZZ _yyyy_", 'en\_US');?

In fact, in this case is the output weird as well:

0-08-21T18:50:20+00:00

Looks like the year is not recognized at all...

same happens in ZF 1.11.5

This is my workaround:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date( strtotime($tweet['created_at']) );

Still happens in 1.11.10.

The problem seems to be in Zend\_Locale\_Format : the \_parseDate() method ignore the ZZZZ format, but consider the date part 0000 as the year instead of 2010.

I add a patch that solves the problem for me.
