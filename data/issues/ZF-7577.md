ZF-7577: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_Stream fails when object name or path contains spaces

### Description

I am unable to use the S3 stream wrapper to retrieve a file whose path, or file name contains spaces, regardless of whether I urlencode\\rawurlencode the path first.

To make sure this wasn't an issue in my codebase, I ran a modified version of the test distributed in the full distribution of ZF. I ran it against both versions 1.9.1 and 1.9.0. On line 65 of the test, change the filename to say $this->\_fileName = $this->\_bucketName."/test+file.txt"; or $this->\_fileName = $this->\_bucketName."/test%20file.txt"; . When I run the test, testReadObject fails (all other tests pass). The error message is {quote} 1) testReadObject(Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_StreamTest) Failed asserting that two strings are equal. expected string <xxx ...snip...> difference <??? ...snip...> got string <> {quote}

I did not test this with other characters that would need to be urlencoded to produce a valid url, though my assumption is that those would fail similarly. After that, I tried running it without urlencoding the object name (i.e., $this->\_fileName = $this->\_bucketName."/test file.txt";), and the same test gave an error: {quote} 1) testReadObject(Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_StreamTest) Zend\_Uri\_Exception: Path "/test file.txt" is not a valid HTTP path C:\\Users\\Test\\Websites\\libraries\\ZendFramework-1.9.1\\library\\Zend\\Uri\\Http.php:575 C:\\Users\\Test\\Websites\\libraries\\ZendFramework-1.9.1\\library\\Zend\\Service\\Amazon\\S3.php:463 C:\\Users\\Test\\Websites\\libraries\\ZendFramework-1.9.1\\library\\Zend\\Service\\Amazon\\S3\\Stream.php:200 {quote}

Why put spaces in the first place inside paths/names? (by which I'm not saying this issue isn't legit, but imho it's based on bad practice)

Every major modern operating system allows spaces in file names, and url encoding provides a standard way to allow the same thing on the web. I didn't test this with other characters that need to be escaped, but my gut tells me that this same error would be present for them.

I'm not arguing that it's a great idea to have spaces in file names; honestly, I don't feel strongly either way. That being said, it should absolutely be possible.

I was unable to reproduce this. Please make sure you set the TESTS\_ZEND\_SERVICE\_AMAZON\_ONLINE\_ACCESSKEYID and TESTS\_ZEND\_SERVICE\_AMAZON\_ONLINE\_SECRETKEY in TestConfiguration.php.

phpunit Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3\_StreamTest OK (5 tests, 26 assertions)
