-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-20T01:05:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.8.0 (21/Feb/07)

### Description

I notice the fetchAssoc() is retrieving with one extra/repeated column in the values: [1] => Array

 
        (
    
            [ID] => 1 [repeated] [Name] => Zend Framework
    
        )


Whereas, PEAR DB result-set is: [1] => Array

 
        (
    
            [Name] => Zend Framework
    
        )


[where ID is the key while values are the remaining columns; ID is not repeated in the values]

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

It is appropriate to return all the columns when fetching a row.

The primary key may be a column not called `id`, or it may be a compound primary key, etc.

Reopening so I can close it as Not an Issue.
