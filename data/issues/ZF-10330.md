### Description

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_HtmlTag does not render twice the same string when used with options openOnly/closeOnly/noAttribs. This is because these options are removed while rendering. Then any subsequent rendering will not have original options anymore. Here is a simple test case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    include('Zend/Form/Decorator/HtmlTag.php');
    
    $deco = new Zend_Form_Decorator_HtmlTag();
    $deco->setOptions(array('class' => 'myClass', 'openOnly' => true));
    $content = "hello world";
    
    echo $deco->render($content); // OK: This will print only opening tag
    echo "\n";
    echo $deco->render($content); // WRONG: This will print both tag


This test case generate the following HTML:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


    hello world

`hello world`    
    

`I would suggest to modify Zend so the options are never removed from the array $this->_options but instead temporarily removed from the array which is only used while rendering. So the source file would look like that:`

    


    <pre class="highlight">
        public function render($content)
        {
            $tag       = $this->getTag();
            $placement = $this->getPlacement();
            $noAttribs = $this->getOption('noAttribs');
            $openOnly  = $this->getOption('openOnly');
            $closeOnly = $this->getOption('closeOnly');
    
            $attribs = null;
            if (!$noAttribs) {
                $attribs = $this->getOptions();
                
                // Prevent reserved options to appear in HTML
                unset($attribs['noAttribs']);
                unset($attribs['openOnly']);
                unset($attribs['closeOnly']);
            }
    
            [...]

This is somewhat related to the old issue ZF-7320 for Matthew mentioned the same bug as explained in this issue. However as it was only a comment and nothing changed since then (one year), I reckon it is ok to fill a new, specific issue about that.
