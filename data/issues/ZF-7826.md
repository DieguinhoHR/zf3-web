### Description

One could extend Zend Tool Response with the possibility to set an exit code.

The console client that can use this to really do exit($code); while for example an XML-RPC client could throw a fault exception or something. also catched exceptions thrown from providers should somehow use the pre-defined zf exit code 1 or something.
