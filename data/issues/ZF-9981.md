### Description

Hi,

Often, lot of sites are allowing login by both email and username at the same time.

So i found useful so we are able to specify as identity column an array of fields to check.

By example we could use both email and username field. The user should enter any of them, if he's matching the password with either the username or email then he's authentificated.
