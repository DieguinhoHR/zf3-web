ZF-2780: Zend\_Config\_Ini not throwing exception if file doesn't exist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently Zend\_Config\_Ini gives a generic PHP Warning in case the file does not exist. I propose throwing an Exception in this case, so it can be left to the developer to determine how to handle this, instead of having to fall back on PHP error handling.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(!file_exists($filename)) {
       /** @see Zend_Config_Exception */
       require_once 'Zend/Config/Exception.php';
       throw new Zend_Config_Exception('File does not exist');
    }
