### Description

There's some outdated info in the docs regarding checks Zend\_Loader has performed in the past.

This sentence for example is incorrect ' This method throws Zend\_Exception on failure, for example if the specified file does not exist.' ( [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.html) ). People trying to reproduce code get in trouble by this kind of (imho minor) mistakes.
