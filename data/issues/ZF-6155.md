### Description

I just signed up with Amazon EC2. I setup a basic Ubuntu 8 box and then use apt-get to get php running in command line mode.

Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo reports a segmentatioin fault in the \_prepare() function on this line:

$this->\_stmt = $this->\_adapter->getConnection()->prepare($sql);

I discovered that the segment fault goes away if I open the file named "Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php" and then comment out the following line located in the \_connect function.

// I have to keep this line commented out or else i get a segmentation fault on the command line when i run my scripts // setAttribute(PDO::ATTR\_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE\_EXCEPTION);

Please advise!

What PHP/Apache version do you use ?

Do you have any code that shows how to trigger this segfault + what zf version are you using?

Turns out I was using an outdated version of zend framework. I've upgraded to the current release and I no longer get seg faults.

Closing as not an issue, seems to work in at least 1.9
