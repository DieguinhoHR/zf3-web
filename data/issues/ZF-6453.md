ZF-6453: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_setup does not call \_setupMetadata or \_setupPrimaryKey

### Description

In ZF 1.7.8 (as supplied with Zend Server) and ZF 1.8.0PR (as linked from <http://framework.zend.com>) the \_setup method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        protected function _setup()
        {
            $this->_setupDatabaseAdapter();
            $this->_setupTableName();
        }


whereas on 1.6.2 it is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        protected function _setup()
        {
            $this->_setupDatabaseAdapter();
            $this->_setupTableName();
            $this->_setupMetadata();
            $this->_setupPrimaryKey();
        }


One result of this is that if the primary key is defined using:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        _primary = array ( 'ID' );


then the primary key starts off as a zero-based array (the PHP default) and then changes to a 1-based array the first time that \_setupPrimaryKey is called, e.g. by a call to $table->select().

However, I am sure there are lots of other unintended sideffects from not calling \_setupMetadata.

This issue also affects the released 1.8.0

It seems as though current development is being done in the root: branch ([http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php#broot):) and that the most recent version of that ([http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php#r13554)) is the one included in ZF 1.8.0.

The error seems to have been introduced in Rev 12290 - see [http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php?r1=12245&r2=12290)

See here why $this->\_setupMetadata(); was removed <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3771>

This was changed in ZF-2510 to allow lazy-loading of those items. You must extend Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract to either provide an alternate implementation or simply call the existing implementations:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Table extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract 
    {
        protected function _setup()
        {
            parent::_setup();
            $this->_setupMetadata();
        }
    }
