- This is a bugtracker not a forum.
- Zend Framework doesn't include a class with name "ZendJobQueue".

If you have questions, then use the [mailing lists](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Mailing+Lists).

ZendJobQueue is part of the Zend Server product, not Zend Framework. Please direct support questions for it to [http://forums.zend.com/viewforum.php/…](http://forums.zend.com/viewforum.php?f=8&sid=17e22ad165b00886b60b230707b415de)
