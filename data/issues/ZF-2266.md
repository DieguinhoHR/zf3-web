### Description

Working with Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Csv, I got a line in the translation file like this:

direccion\_envio;Direcci&oacute;;n de env&iacute;;o

The semicolon in '&oacute;' and '&iacute;' was escaped by doubling it.

Translating the 'direccion\_envio' label should return 'Direcci&oacute;n de env&iacute;o' which is properly shown in the navigator BUT it really returns 'Direcci&oacute;n de env&iacut'.

I suppose it's a bug with the second appearance of ';;'
