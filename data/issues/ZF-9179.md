ZF-9179: \_getParam second parameter no longer working when used in conjunction with routes

### Description

Ever since we upgraded to ZF 1.9.7, \_getParam no longer replaces "empty" values with the second parameter. This is related to ZF-5163.

When a route has been defined as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route( ':lang/:controller/:action/*',
                    array('controller'=>'index',
                        'action' => 'index',
                        'module'=>'default',
                        'lang'=>'en'));


and the user types a URL like "http://myapp.example.com//examplecontroller/exampleaction",

- \_getParam('lang') returns an empty string instead of null
- \_getParam('lang','en') now returns an empty string(!). Prior to ZF 1.9.7, it returns 'en', which is the expected result.

Since our application relies on routes, upgrading to 1.9.7 broke several major modules.
