### Description

Hi, this is my first contribution and I have no idea what, if any, the typical format is for this is... here goes.

The setClass method of the Zend\_Json\_Server differs from that of the SoapServer.

SoapServer: void setClass ( string $class\_name [, mixed $args [, mixed $... ]] )

Vrs.

Zend\_Json\_Server: void setClass ( string $class [, string $namespace [, mixed $argv ...]] )

The syntax difference is an annoyance. The fact that currently the additional parameters are Ignored takes away functionality. There is no way to pass a constructor to the handling class.
