### Description

When calling the delete function from an object that is derived from the Zend\_Db\_Table class the following error occurs when using PDO Postgresql.

_Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted at /downloads/php-5.1.4/ext/pdo\_pgsql/pgsql\_driver.c:323 (tried to allocate 4194823 bytes) in /usr/local/php/ZendFramework-0.1.3/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php on line 181_

It strands on line 181 from the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract class. Wich is the one line in the following function:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    protected function _quote($value)
    {
      return $this->_connection->quote($value);
    }


$this->\_connection is a PDO object wich calls the quote method. I tested the quote method and it worked fine.

Also manually deleted a record with PDO::query wich worked fine.

The problem is probably somewhere at the query method in class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract.

Can anyone confirm this problem (and propose a patch) using Zend Framework 0.1.4 and PHP-5.1.4+ ?

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

I have used PostgreSQL for many queries, and have not seen this issue. As far as I know, no one has reported a similar issue in the 9 months since this issue was first reported. I suspect that it is dependent on the user's environment, or that the input $value was excessively large.
