### Description

On line 71, Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules checks if the bootstrap class for a specific module is loaded using class\_exists. However, the second argument for class\_exists isn't set to false.

Also, the resource seems to already be setup to try and load the class if it's not loaded already. Suggested fix:

Change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    To:

I think this partially solves ZF-6658.

Maybe same problem with class\_exists is in ZF-6672, can you please reassign and fix ZF-6672 also?

This fixes ZF-6707 also.
