ZF-5368: Zend Form multicheckbox incorrectly named
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-12-29T00:44:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-07-27T12:19:19.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The following will not work and throws an exception: $form->addElement('multicheckbox', 'sendAction', array()));

You need to write $form->addElement('multiCheckbox', 'sendAction', array()));

This is because the MultiCheckBox form element class has a capital 'C' in it at variance to the naming standard for all other element names.

MultiCheckbox is correctly named; ZF coding standards indicate that multiple words should be written using camelCasing. (For the record, _Multiselect_ is the one that is misnamed, but we cannot rename it as it would introduce a BC break.)

Will this issue (missnamed multiselect) be patched for a future major version in spite of BC ?

Thank you
