ZF-4181: Logging after Zend\_Controller\_Front dispath() has completed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In some cases it is useful to log to Firebug after the front controller has finished dispatching.

This should be possible by buffering the output, logging the usual way and then flushing the headers again with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Wildfire_Channel_HttpHeaders::getInstance()->flush();
    Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getResponse()->sendHeaders(); 


At the moment this does not work as the Wildfire Protocol Message Index gets reset after the flush causing a previously sent header to be over-written.

The index needs to be kept for the entire duration of the page request.

Maybe we could add a method to the Front Controller and Response class to delay sending of headers until shutdown. This would start output buffering and register a shutdown function.

We would also need the ability to add a listener to the sendHeaders() method in the Response class. The same listener may be required for ZF-4134.
