### Description

Because of strong typing in the Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Button class, function button(), argument 4 is null when a decorator is set.

Same with SubmitButton, others not checked.

$this->addElement ( 'Button', 'closeBtn', array ('label' => 'Close', 'class' => 'CloseBtn', 'decorators' => array ( 'ViewHelper' ) ) );

-- or -- $this->addElement ( 'Button', 'closeBtn', array ('label' => 'Close', 'class' => 'CloseBtn' ) ); $this->setElementDecorators( array ('ViewHelper' ) );

Apparently this happens only when using Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper as a decorator, but does not happen when using Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitElement.

Question is, should a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element be able to use a Zend\_Form\_Decorator? If no, then, I think, this is not an issue.

You _can_ use any decorator, but we can't _guarantee_ that it will work if you use something other than DijitElement when using Dojo form elements. I'm closing as "won't fix", as the solution is simply to use DijitElement instead of ViewHelper as the decorator.
