### Description

We should be able to influence the outcome of the word generation for the captcha, either by setting filters (example, toUpperCase) and/or by setting the char pool from which we want our words generated. The quick fix is to make Zend\_Captcha\_Word::\_setWord() public (which delegates the word generation to the developer), but a better fix would be to enable us with above proposed solutions.

As an example of why being able to set the char pool would be useful: It can be quite hard to differentiate the characters 1 and l; and a, o and 0 in some fonts (especially with all the captcha image effects applied), so it'd be good to be able to drop these chars out.

Maybe the easiest way would be to extends this class (Zend\_Captcha\_Word) and override \_generateWord?

I think extending the class is the right way to go here. Just override \_generateWord with any algorithm you like.
