ZF-6590: Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_FormErrors ignores elements in subgroups
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-09T09:50:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-05-24T09:03:45.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Form::getMessages() returns errors for elements which are in subgroups as a sub-array of their subgroup name.

So they are not caught as instances of Zend\_Form or Zend\_Form\_Element in the foreach in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_FormErrors::\_recurseForm().

To fix, change line 369 to

$errors = $form->getMessages(null, true);

so that the errors array that is returned is "flat" with respect to subgroups.
