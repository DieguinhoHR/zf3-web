### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/153>

ATTACHMENT IN TRAC

When I use the drawText() method on a Zend\_Pdf page that is 5.5(w) x 8.5(h) inches, the text is rendered at a 90 degree angle, reading up the page instead of normal left to right horizontal.

Specifically, the document I'm working with can be found at <http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/6890.pdf>

Closing as duplicate (we actually got the original issue into JIRA before the Trac migration was complete).
