### Description

Given the ':' after the "if" statement below, and the "endif;" I'm guessing this example was intended to work inside a view? Regardless, everything after the "if", up to, and including the "$cache->end();" should be grouped for conditional execution under the "if".

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php 
    // if it is a cache miss, output buffering is triggered 
    if(!$cache->start('mypage')): 
    // output everything as usual 
    echo 'Hello world! '; 
    echo 'This is cached ('.time().') '; 
    $cache->end(); // output buffering ends 
    endif; 
    echo 'This is never cached ('.time().').'; 
    ?>

Bookkeeping. Assigning all issues to the person who ultimately resolved them.
