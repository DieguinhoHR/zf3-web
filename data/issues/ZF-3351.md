### Description

There is an error in the manual page about the Zend\_View helper "translate", ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.translate))

The manual seems to state that there is a view helper "getLocale", while this is not the case. You can only access this method by "$this->translate()->getLocale()".

The same probably applies for the other related examples.

- Example 42.25. Get the currently set locale
- ... setTranslate()
