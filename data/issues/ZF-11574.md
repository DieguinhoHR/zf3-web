### Description

I updated a project to use a more recent version of ZF and a unit test failed.

I had $client->setAdapter('test'); in it in order to use Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Test. I'm not really sure what version it used before (it doesn't say). But it's been a long, long while since ZF was updated.

Here's a patch to correct the problem:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Index: Client.php

    +            if (false === strpos($adapter, 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_', 0)) {
    +                $adapter = 'Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_' . ucfirst(strtolower($adapter));
    +            }
                 try {
                     Zend_Loader::loadClass($adapter);
                 } catch (Zend_Exception $e) {


If you need a test, let me know where to find them and I'll add a patch for that as well.

Convenient as this would be, what if you write a custom adapter that isn't in the "Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter" vendor prefix, and pass that class name to setAdapter()? As written, the patch would still prepend that prefix, and thus try and load a non-existent class.

I think this is a situation where adding a broker would work best -- and that would need to be done in ZF2.
