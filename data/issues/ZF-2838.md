-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-03-10T03:38:05.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-06-08T07:16:06.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Add toString() method to Zend\_Config\_(Xml|Ini) do export actual configuration. Modifications are possible, if readonly is disabled.

 
    <pre class="highlight">class Zend_Config_Xml extends Zend_Config {
        public function __toString() {
            /* create xml document content */
        }
    }

 
    <pre class="highlight">class Zend_Config_Ini extends Zend_Config {
        public function __toString() {
            /* create ini document content */
        }
    }

This will make it easy to edit configuration by an adminpanel or sth.

This would only be able to export the result of loading an ini file. i.e. this wouldn't be the same as what was loaded in.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Adding writing abilities for config files requires a new proposal. I suspect a separate class may be required depending on the overhead as writing a config file is done much less often than reading one.
