### Description

The \_makeId method of the cache Function frontend should be public. This would allow us to remove a cached result if the result is not the one to be cached. For example: I wrapped a http request call and if the results is a non 200 http code I wouldn't want to be cached and enforce to be request until I get some content.

This already was done in version 1.10.7 see ZF-9970. Thanks by your report.
