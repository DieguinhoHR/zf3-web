### Description

When doing a select query over a collection of more than 100 items Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb don't return the nextToken value from the XML response.

The error is located at file Zend/Service/Amazon/SimpleDB.php line 405:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $nextToken = (string)$xml->NextToken;


And should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $nextToken = (string)$xml->SelectResult->NextToken;

What happens with collections of less than 100 items? can the NextToken be received in the same way as in your patch? If so, I'll apply; if not, we need to check for existence and branch accordingly.

Patch worked for me with domains and queries of varying sizes. I think it was just a typo to begin with or maybe Amazon changed their response format.
