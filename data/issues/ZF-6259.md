ZF-6259: Echo ISO-8859-15, adjust my php.ini?

### Description

Looking for some help as I am a newbie.

The idea is pretty simple, I would like to create a Google Calendar (or any other google data item) event with a special Latin-9 (ISO-8859-15) character and echo that to the browser.

If I create an event called "Test: Œ, œ, Ÿ, Š, š, Ž, ž", everything is fine on the web site, google accepts it, renders it just fine. If I then update my outputCalendar() function to

 
        echo iconv('UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-15', $event->title->text)


then I get the following event title:

 
     "Test: ¼, ½, ¾, ¦, ¨, ´, "


From doing some reading, I believe this may be an issue with my php.ini file. Taking a few stabs in the dark, I just tried these php.ini settings (with the same result):

 
    default_charset = "iso-8859-15"
    exif.encode_unicode = ISO-8859-15


Thanks, Bill

Here is the full php.ini.

Hmm, I am not 100% sure about iconv but I read in the docs that the results can be inconsistent. Perhaps double check that the proper library is installed?

"Note that the iconv function on some systems may not work as you expect. In such case, it'd be a good idea to install the » GNU libiconv library. It will most likely end up with more consistent results."

Not a Zend\_Gdata issue
