### Description

When I create a structure for a new module with zf.sh I rather want module directory to be in lower case (like other directories are e.g. "controllers", "models" etc.) so I have to type "zf create module admin" (lowercased). But then the problem is that controller classes are named in lower case also e.g. admin\_IndexController insted of Admin\_IndexController

This is related with ZF-9695 and ZF-10237 already fixed in the 1.11.1.
