ZF-11003: Inappropriate MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM method selection in Mcrypt.php

### Description

Hi,

First submission so be gentle.

I noticed all my Window production sites failed when adding the `Encrypt` filter to Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http using the `mcrypt` adapter.

The patch alters Mcrypt.php to allow for the selection of MCRYPT\_RAND rather than forced into MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM. MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM is still available on the existence of `/dev/urandom`.

Index: Mcrypt.php

Sorry, I have no idea how to attach the patch file.

I have confirmed this issue on a Windows Server 2003 with PHP 5.3 and Apache 2.2 instance. It chooses MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM instead of MCRYPT\_RAND. The first test fails.

I can not confirm this problem on Windows XP, Windows 7 with PHP 5.2.4, PHP 5.3 and Apache 2.2 within vanilla php.
