### Description

When using the Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo::bindValue() method, which overrides Zend\_Db\_Statement::bindValue(), the $\_bindParam array never has the parameter and its value added.

I'm attaching a single-line patch here to fix the issue. If Zend\_Db\_Statement::bindValue() weren't being overridden in Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo, this wouldn't have been a problem.

My primary use case is that, when using Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug, the bound parameters are showing up as NULL in the table, even though parameters were passed.

I first saw this on 1.7.1, but it's probably existed for quite some time. The attached patch file is against 1.7.5, though. I've got SVN access -- can I just commit this change myself?

Correction, the patch file I'm submitting will be against trunk.
