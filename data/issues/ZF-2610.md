ZF-2610: ZC\_Front should throw its own exception if path in addModuleDirectory() is not readable

### Description

Actually, if you set an incorrect path to addModuleDirectory() of Zend\_Controller\_Front ; it uses SPL's DirectoryIterator without catching its exceptions.

Thus, the incorrect path throws a RuntimeException that does not extend Zend\_Exception and can not be properly managed.

The patch attached simply resolves that
