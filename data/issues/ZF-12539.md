### Description

In config Ini, When inheriting environment from another, and appending to an existing array, it overrides its values instead of merging it

example [production] props[]="A" [development : production] props[]="B"

using development environment output: array{ [0]=>"B" }

Expected: array{ [0]=>"A" [1]=>"B" }

In case I need to reset the array I can reset it using props[]=
