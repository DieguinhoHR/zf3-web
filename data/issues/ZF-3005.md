ZF-3005: Zend\_Cache SQLite backend creates SQLite 2.x databases
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-03-31T23:52:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-17T12:55:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Apparently, Zend\_Cache SQLite backend creates SQLite 2.x databases that most GUI tools fail to open them because they support only SQLite 3.x databases. Need an option to specify which version of SQLite database files to create (2.x, 3.x). Maybe, use PDO sqlite while creating the database file?

Further, under unix, the sqlite db file is created as a unix executable with the following privileges:

\_www : Read & Write staff : Read & Write everyone : Read & Write

Is this an issue with not being able to open the file in sqlite GUI tools?

Hi,

I tried twice submitting the issue form but the view file was missing on the server and hence running into an error. I did not know that the data was indeed inserted into the db. I posted a missing-view message on the framework list and then gave up.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
