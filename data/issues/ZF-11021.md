ZF-11021: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 requests fail when the bucket name has underscores

### Description

Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 generates the URL for requests by prepending the bucket name to the S3 endpoint. This works fine for most cases, but the set of characters allowed by Zend\_Uri in a hostname doesn't match up completely with the allowed characters in an S3 bucket.

In particular, the underscore is allowed in an S3 bucket name, but Zend\_Uri doesn't allow underscores in a hostname. The result is a Zend\_Uri\_Exception when trying to do much of anything in a bucket containing underscores.

I assume the simple solution would be to instead use the alternative S3 URL style that includes the bucket name as the first portion of the path.
