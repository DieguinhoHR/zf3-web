ZF-10100: WindowsAzure is out-of-date from PHPAzure
---------------------------------------------------

### Description

Because Zend\_Service\_WindowsAzure is based on [PHPAzure](http://phpazure.codeplex.com/) I have assumed it will be in sync with it. But, it doesn't include setBlobProperties() method and some others.

ZF: $\_apiVersion = '2009-04-14'; PHPAzure: $\_apiVersion = '2009-09-19';

Will be synchronized once PHPAzure v2.0 is released. Stay tuned!
