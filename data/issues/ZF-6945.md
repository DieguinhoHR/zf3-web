ZF-6945: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract to pass in dynamic config to profiler

### Description

It would be very useful if when the profiler is created, any profiler params are passed in from the config.

This could be done in a similar way to Application Resources; for each profiler config check for a 'set' method on the profiler, if it exists call it with the supplied value.

Forgot to say, in my application I have multiple databases, so this feature will be enable me to pass in additional information to a custom profiler class, such as database name.
