ZF-10627: Captcha string out of image
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-11-02T14:08:53.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:28.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Sometimes captcha string is printed out of image so it is not visible.

class: Zend\_Captcha\_Image line 488: imagefilledrectangle($img, 0, 0, $w-1, $h-1, $bg\_color); $textbox = imageftbbox($fsize, 0, $font, $word); $x = ($w - ($textbox[2] - $textbox[0])) / 2; $y = ($h - ($textbox[7] - $textbox[1])) / 2;

Don`t now why but sometimes $x gets huge value over 1000000. Probably there is some bug in imageftbbox function. I found that many other developers have same problem with captcha. Protection for $x value (maybe y also) will be very helpful because we (developers) do not have any possibility to protect our code. As result we get image with dots and lines but without any code.

Can you provide the configuration of the Captcha object?

class Core\_Form\_Element\_Captcha\_Image extends Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha { public function \_\_construct( $Name, $Options = null ) { $captchaImage = new Zend\_Captcha\_Image( 'captchaImg' );  
 $captchaImage->setFontSize(36) ->setLineNoiseLevel( 2 )  
 ->setFont( APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../public/fonts/12tonfishstick.ttf' )  
 ->setWordlen(6)  
 ->setWidth(176) ->setHeight(75);

 
        $Options['captcha'] = $captchaImage;
    
        parent::__construct( $Name, $Options );
    }


}

It doesn`t happen very often. Sometimes I need to generate many captcha to get it.
