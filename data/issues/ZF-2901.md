### Description

In the Programmer's Reference Guide (Section 7.5.1.), about the lighttpd rewrite rule there is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    url.rewrite-once = (
      ".*\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$" => "$0",
      "" => "/index.php"
    )


But with this rewrite rule you miss the HTTP GET parameters

I suggest this rule (tested with succes on my website):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    url.rewrite-once = (
      ".*\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$" => "$0",
      ".*\?(.*)$" => "/index.php?$1",
      "" => "/index.php"
    )

It looks like both rulesets would be susceptible to breaking when GET parameters end in the same suffixes as listed in the first rule of each ruleset. For example, URLs such as:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <a href="http://example.com/?style=my.css">http://example.com/?style=my.css</a>
    <a href="http://example.com/index/?a=1&which=nice.gif">http://example.com/index/?a=1&which=nice.gif</a>


would match the first rule and fail. Perhaps these are edge cases, however.

You are absolutely right Darby

I may have a solution, you just have to swap two lines:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    url.rewrite-once = (
      ".*\?(.*)$" => "/index.php?$1",
      ".*\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$" => "$0",
      "" => "/index.php"
    )
