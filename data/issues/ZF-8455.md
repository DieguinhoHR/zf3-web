In query problem with the function pg\_table\_is\_visible

zf 1.9.6

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function listTables()
    {
        $sql = "SELECT c.relname  AS table_name "
              . "FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c "
              . "JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles r ON r.oid = c.relowner "
              . "LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace "
              . "WHERE n.nspname <> 'pg_catalog' "
              . "AND n.nspname !~ '^pg_toast' "
              . "AND pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible(c.oid) "
              . "AND c.relkind = 'r' ";
    
        return $this->fetchCol($sql);
    }


zf 1.9.5

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function listTables()
    {
        // @todo use a better query with joins instead of subqueries
        $sql = "SELECT c.relname AS table_name "
             . "FROM pg_class c, pg_user u "
             . "WHERE c.relowner = u.usesysid AND c.relkind = 'r' "
             . "AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_views WHERE viewname = c.relname) "
             . "AND c.relname !~ '^(pg_|sql_)' "
             . "UNION "
             . "SELECT c.relname AS table_name "
             . "FROM pg_class c "
             . "WHERE c.relkind = 'r' "
             . "AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_views WHERE viewname = c.relname) "
             . "AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_user WHERE usesysid = c.relowner) "
             . "AND c.relname !~ '^pg_'";
    
        return $this->fetchCol($sql);
    }

My fault, this commit wasn't suppose to be in branch but only in trunk that's why the "Fix Versions" field of ZF-8046 was "Next minor release" I will revert it ASAP.
