### Description

with ZF 1.6.2 (from [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.6.2/library/Zend/)), on php 5.1.6 (stock Centos 5.2 distro) this code:

 <?php ... echo $this->headTitle(); ?> renders something like

Object#xx

(where xx is some number) rather than the title tags and text that it should render (and does render on a development server running php 5.2x).

If I change the code to

echo $this->headTitle()->toString();

the php 5.1.6 server gives me the same result as on the php 5.2+ one.

Since ZF ver 1.6.2 is suuposed to be compatible with php 5.1.4+, this appears to be a bug.

I just testing this code on my centos 4.5 server running php 5.1.6 and it worked just fine. I'm using the 1.7.2 code base. Is there any reason you are still using 1.6.2?

This wont be fixed since it's not an issue in the current 1.7.x release.
