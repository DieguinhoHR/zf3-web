### Description

A filter dropping new line control characters (\\n, \\r\\n, \\r) would be nice, maybe something like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Filter/Interface.php';
    
    class Zend_Filter_DropNewLines implements Zend_Filter_Interface
    {
    
        public function filter($value)
        {
    
            return str_replace(array("\n", "\n\r", "\r"), '', $value);
    
        }
    
    }
