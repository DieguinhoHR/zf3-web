### Description

When using Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::copyObject without the $meta array, it copies the metadata from the source object to the destination object. However, the ACL of the destination object is always set to private by Amazon S3: {quote}The default ACL for the copied object is private regardless of the ACL of the source object. To use a different ACL, specify the _x-amz-acl_ header as you would with a regular PUT request. (source: [<http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/proposals/copy.html>]){quote} Specifying the _x-amz-acl_ header however results in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::copyObject discarding all other Metadata by setting the _x-amz-metadata-directive_ to REPLACE instead of COPY. It is also not possible to change the _x-amz-metadata-directive_ header via the $meta array as it is always overwritten.

So in order to copy a public object including metadata, I have to set both the ACL and the metadata manually in the $meta array when calling copyObject. In my opinion, it would be better if the _x-amz-metadata-directive_ was only set by Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::copyObject if it wasn't already present in the $meta array.
