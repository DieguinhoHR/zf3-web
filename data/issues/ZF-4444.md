### Description

RadioButton into subform causes problem. Really simple to reproduce : - Create a dojo subform - Create a radiobutton dojo form element - Add the radiobutton to the dojo subform - Render it !

Click on the 2 values added, you'll see that the radiobutton don't swap. It checked the two options.

I've tested radiobuttons dojo on subforms (on displaygroups, on containers...) and it worksed on 1.6.1. I think you should send your test case, ther's maybe a bug in it . Maybe when dojo isn't activated the 'degraded mode' make your radiobutton buggy.

more on this. Actually I reproduce the bug with the new dojo libraries (1.2.0) Bug cames from Dojo libraries and not Zend Framework. I submitted a workaround here: <http://trac.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/8016>. Seems to be fixed now.
