### Description

223 files [1] that are not actually executable have their executable bits set in the current (1.6.0) ZF full tarball. One bourne shell script (./externals/dojo/dojox/storage/buildFlashStorage.sh) on the other hand is not set executable.

It seems to be outdated

You can reproduce the list for each new release version by executing:

find . -type f -perm /111 \\ -fprint executables -exec chmod -x '{}' \\; >/dev/null

find . -type f -name \*.sh \\ -fprint valid\_executables -exec chmod +x '{}' \\; >/dev/null

cat executables valid\_executables|sort|uniq -u > invalid\_executables

I've just updated the link at [1] in the description for 1.7.2.
