### Description

\\Zend\\View\\Helper\\ServerUrl does not take into account when the request is coming from a proxy server. Here is that patch.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST']) && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'])) {
                $host = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'];
                if (strpos($host, ',')) {
                    // See Symfony ticket #3842 (<a href="http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/3842">http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/3842</a>)
                    $hosts = explode(',', $host);
                    $host = array_pop($hosts);
                }
                $this->setHost($host);
            } elseif (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) && !empty($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])) {
