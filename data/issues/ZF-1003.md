As you resolved the old one, I need to reopen it this way. I gave you the information you requested. If this is the wrong information or you need more detailed information please tell me so.

The tests still fail with latest svn:

1) testCreationDefaultFormat(Zend\_DateTest) Failed asserting that <string:2006-01-01T00:00:00+05:00> is identical to <string:2005-11-30T00:00:00+05:00>. /home/sebastian/Work/ZendFramework/tests/Zend/DateTest.php:73

I asked for the standard locale by 25.Feb... I got no response... wether from you, from sebastian nor from gavin...

As I asked once per jira and two times per mail and got no response, so I closed the issue as "can not reproduce"...

I need "setlocale()"... the locale settings from the environment you are running the tests to reproduce the behaviour.

Without it I am not able to reproduce the failure... I use Windows XP with Php 5.2.1 adn PHP5.1.4 and was not able to reproduce this issue.

Thank you...

Even with the locale set I was not able to reproduce the problem... I tested with several environments (windows, cygwin, with and without BCmath and with two different locales... and had never this problems.

I asked gavin to help me with reproduction... without a way to reproduce this I can not fix it :-( This will need a few days.
