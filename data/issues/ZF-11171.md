ZF-11171: Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext fopens and doesn't fclose
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In \_loadTranslationData, Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext fopens the translation file and never fcloses it.

This can result in PHP holding a lot of open file handles for files that, as far as I can tell, have already been fully processed. Handles for any invalid files encountered during a scan are also held.

In particular, it seems like there should be fclose calls before both "is not a gettext file" exception throws and before the function returns.

Thomas, unless the commit doesn't look good, and you have valid issues with the work done, please don't reassign and reopen. Adam did acceptable work, it was reviewed and approved.

@Ralph: As there was no response to my request regarding I18n components I integrated it within ZF2 with [GH-277](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/277). If this is against your intention on how I have to handle issues for my components please state it and I will remove it again from ZF2.
