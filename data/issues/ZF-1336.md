### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchNew() method is named in a confusing way. After discussing it on the community mailing list, would be better to name it createRow(). Please make this change.

Make the old fetchNew() method proxy to the new createRow() method. No need to remove the old method, it would break backward compatibility needlessly.

Document the createRow() method, and remove mention of the fetchNew() method.

Update unit tests.

Implemented code and unit test changes in revisions 4643, 4644.

Still need to change documentation.
