### Description

as stated in the docs ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.scripts.html#zend.view.scripts.escaping)), a custom callback function can receive additional parameters: "The callback function or method should take the value to be escaped as its first parameter, and all other parameters should be optional." this doesn't work though as the escape method only accepts 1 param.

Good point -- and looking at the code, this could be fairly easily remedied; will work on this for the next mini release.
