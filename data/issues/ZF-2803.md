ZF-2803: PHP 5.3 compatibility for Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-03-04T14:44:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-21T02:54:10.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File checks for runtime magic quotes. The following patch a) checks whether the function is available (as the functions are removed in PHP 6) and b) suppresses the E\_DEPRECATED warning.

Sorry, but your fix is incomplete. PHP 5.3 introduces E\_DEPRECATED. E\_DEPRECATED is part of E\_STRICT and when set/get\_magic\_quotes() is called, a deprecation warning is thrown. This means, you have to disable errors with @ in addition to checking whether the function is available as like I did it in my original patch.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Yes, error suppression is very nice in a production environment, but my development environment does not suppress errors/notices and this problem still persists.

Please fix this, it should not use a deprecated function.

Thank you for your work!
