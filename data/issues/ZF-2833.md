### Description

Currently, we advocate using short tags in view scripts, and all examples in the documentation use them. However, some people have them disabled for a variety of reasons, and are not aware that they can re-enable them or do not have the ability to do so.

We can support this my using PHP's streams to filter the view script as it is being read. For more information on how this can be done, see:

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
