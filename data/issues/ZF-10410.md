### Description

First I am using Zend\_Service\_Akismet to validate the comment. Then I'm using Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Sqs to queue some data. Response from Amazon I'm getting:

Sender`SignatureDoesNotMatch`The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details....

Replacing line 347: $client->resetParameters(); with $client->resetParameters(true); // which also resets the headers fixes the problem.

The exact problem is that the host header is not being reset and that bothers Amazon. Here's a dump of request headers:

After talking to Akismet first: GET /?Action=ListQueues&AWSAccessKeyId=...&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=...&Version=2009-02-01&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&Signature=... HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Zend Framework/1.10.8 | Akismet/1.11 Host: rest.akismet.com

Without talking to Akismet: GET /?Action=ListQueues&AWSAccessKeyId=...&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=...&Version=2009-02-01&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&Signature=... HTTP/1.1 Host: queue.amazonaws.com User-Agent: Zend\_Http\_Client

Possibly this is a bug in Zend\_Http\_Client and calling setUri() should automagically reset the host header.

Cheers, - Andrei
