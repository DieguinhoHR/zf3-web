### Description

DbTable has become TableGateway.

The database save handler for \\Zend\\Session needs to be converted to become compatible with ZF2.

I have started working on this issue, but I am not sure what to name the class file.

The original was called:

library/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/DbTable.php

Based on this document:

[http://akrabat.com/wp-content/uploads/…](http://akrabat.com/wp-content/uploads/Getting-Started-with-Zend-Framework-2.pdf)

from Rob Allen, I have named it:

library/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/SessionsTable.php

Here is the class designation I have in place now:

class SessionsTable extends TableGateway implements Savable

Does this seem appropriate?

I could also do this without extending TableGateway, but still using TableGateway to handle the table.

Based on feedback, I am using:

class TableGateway extends BaseTableGateway implements Savable

where:

Zend\\Db\\TableGateway\\TableGateway as BaseTableGateway

Zend\\Session\\SaveHandler as Savable

I have completed this issue.

Documentation, unit testing and the class itself are functional.

There is 100% code coverage in the unit tests.

Here is the output from TestDox listing of the 43 tests with 117 assertions:
