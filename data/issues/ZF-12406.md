### Description

Proposal: Make it possible to set different cache debug\_headers or disable them based on regexps.

Also it would be cool if you can add an http header and not only

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    cause this breaks json responses for example.
    
    


$frontendOptions = array( 'lifetime' => 10, 'debug\_header' => true, 'regexps' => array( '^/json/$' => array('debug\_header' => false), // im an json response no debug header please '^/json2/$' => array('debug\_header\_http' => 'x-header-zendcache'), // im an json response and thus i got a real http debug header ) ); ```

Would be nice to have this possibility for phpunit / selenium etc.
