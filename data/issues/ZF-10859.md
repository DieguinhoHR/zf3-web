### Description

Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog uses method chaining for setApplicationName() and setFacility() (also doc-comment is wrong), but in factory() the result of setFacility () is set as the facility attribute.

$this->\_facility = $this->setFacility($params['facility']);

Fix: 106: $this->setFacility($params['facility']); 179: \* @return Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog 213: \* @return Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Syslog
