### Description

In Zend/Db/Adapter/Driver/Pdo/Statement.php on line 218 when throwing an InvalidQueryException it tries to access $this->resource->error for the exception message.

PDO and PDOStatement have "errorCode" [1] and "errorInfo" [2] methods for getting information about the errors.

I am/was testing with beta3 and Rob Allen's ZF2 tutorial.

Pull request is on it's way.

php -v PHP 5.3.10
