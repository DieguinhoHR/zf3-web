### Description

Would it be possible to use a string which "match" the class constant instead of the class constant it self which need a require\_one before we can use it. The string can be evaluate later on with the function constant()

This is more readable than an integer key.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Use this
    $validators = array(
        'month'   => array('Int', array('Between', 1, 12), 'messages' => array ('Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN_STRICT' => 'doit être compris entre 1 et 12')  )    
    ); 
    
    // instead of
    $validators = array(
        'month'   => array('Int', array('Between', 1, 12), 'messages' => array (Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN_STRICT => 'doit être compris entre 1 et 12')  )    
    );

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Any why not using an autoloader ? I see no benefit by integrating this request.

It would, on the other side, add additional problems like a exception when there is a wrong written constant/classname at validation time.

+1 to what Thomas said.

Closing as "Won't Fix".

After reviewing it again after a longer time and discussing it with other people my original intention has been confirmed. The correct solution for the intended problem or request is using autoloaders.
