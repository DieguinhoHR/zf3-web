### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail expects string "parameters" option in the ctor. However, the resource code now is:

 
            case 'Zend_Mail_Transport_Sendmail':
            default:
                $transport = new $transportName($options);
                break;


which means it passes there $options array and when sending the mail, it fails since mail() function would not accept parameters as an array. This means it's impossible to configure sendmail transport through resource.
