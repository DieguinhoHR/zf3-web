### Description

Currently, the StripTags filter allows optionally allowing comments. However, this should never be allowed, as it's possible to perform IE-style conditional comments that could open XSS attack vectors:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filter = new Zend_Filter_StripTags;                                                                          
    $filter->setCommentsAllowed(true);                                                                            
    $html = "";                                       
    $out = $filter->filter($html);
    // results in:
    //
