ZF-1837: Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite missing a getCurrentRoute method
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hello,

On Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite there is no method to get \_currentRoute member.

We must extend Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite in order to get this parameter.

I think a simple member function like this:

 
    public function getCurrentRoute()
    {
        return $this->_currentRoute;
    }


can solve problems. Maybe we need to check if current route is set or not too...
