### Description

According to ZF-39 Zend\_Db\_Table::find() had support for For Update because of the addition of the Zend\_Db\_Select::forUpdate() method. While this did work for the fetch operations of Zend\_Db\_Table it does not work for the find method because Zend\_Db\_Table::find() does not support passing a Zend\_Db\_Select object as a parameter.

find() does not support the usage of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select objects, it is a decorative interface into the functionality of fetchAll(). If you want to use a select object, you're better off passing into fetchAll() as it will be more indicative and expressive of what you are attempting to do.
