### Description

The second example for how to exclude records with the Zend\_Validate\_Db\_\* components in the manual is incorrect/confusing. The example first talks about posts and categories and then skips over to users and usernames.

Link to that part of the manual [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.validate.set.html#zend.validate.db.excluding-records)

Attaching a patch for the example. Hopefully this one is clearer.

Ryan: Do you integrate this patch within ZF2 yourself or should I take this task?

If needed, I can issue a pull request on github with the same patch for ZF2. Just tell me against which branch should I work (master, milestones/documentation...)?
