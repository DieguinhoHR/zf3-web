### Description

The header content-length must be Content-Length (with first letter upper case) the server is case sensitive (at least apache activemq release 5.1.0 ) . Also I found the definition of the header name in two files: Frame.php and Client/Connection.php

Is this RFC matter?

I checked the stomp protocol docs. All references are to a lower-case content-length header.

<http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol>

I will check the ApacheMQ docs next.

Line 50.

 
    public interface Headers {
        String SEPERATOR = ":";
        String RECEIPT_REQUESTED = "receipt";
        String TRANSACTION = "transaction";
        String CONTENT_LENGTH = "content-length";
        String TRANSFORMATION = "transformation";
        String TRANSFORMATION_ERROR = "transformation-error";


It looks like they are using the lower case. This is from apache 5.2. source code.

I randomly checked several of the Stomp.java versions, but I didn't see any references to a "Content-Length" header.

Do you have a test case? There may be other code that I didn't see that is requiring this change...

I have converted this issue from a Major issue to a minor issue. A review of the ActiveMQ and Stomp protocol show the correct header to be "content-length". I am waiting back for more information.

Hi, Daniel. Thank You for conducting a great investigation. :-) I agree with You that the capital letter is not needed in the head of the string. It may be wont fix or can not an issue.

But if users of activemq 5.1 require capital letter , I think they could use this class by modifing the constant value into "Content-Length".
