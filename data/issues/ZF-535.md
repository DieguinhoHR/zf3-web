### Description

The Zend\_Http\_ClientTest suite should be split up:

1. Static tests: Tests that do not perform any connection
2. A common "connection" tests, that is all tests that actually need a server in order to run
3. A series of tests suites that inherit the common connecting test suite, repeating those tesest with different adapters / connection settings / server for example:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Http_ClientTest
     + Zend_Http_ClientTest_Static
     + Zend_Http_ClientTest_Default
        + Zend_Http_ClientTest_Keepalive
        + Zend_Http_ClientTest_Curl
        + Zend_Http_ClientTest_IIS
        + ...
