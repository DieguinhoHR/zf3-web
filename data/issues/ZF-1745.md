ZF-1745: authenticate() not working with DB in fetch mode ASSOC

### Description

When setting DB fetch mode to Zend\_Db::FETCH\_OBJ authentication returns exceptions as in DBTable authentication tries to retrieve via fetchAll and tries to get informations.

The problem is mainly in line 317 of file /Zend/Auth/Adapter/DBTable.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $resultIdentities = $this->_zendDb->fetchAll($dbSelect->__toString());


and in lines 340 and 346, array value is used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $resultIdentity['zend_auth_credential_match']


Changing to fetchAssoc could solve this but there is a bug in the fetchAssoc() function that still returns an array of objects (I'm posting another issue for that).

For now I fixed the problem by adding this before line 315:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $oldFetchMode = $this->_zendDb->getFetchMode();
    $this->_zendDb->setFetchMode(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);


And adding this after line 326:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_zendDb->setFetchMode($oldFetchMode);


So this retrieves fetch mode, changes to assoc and gets back to what it was after the query is executed.

Resolved as duplicating [ZF-1397].
