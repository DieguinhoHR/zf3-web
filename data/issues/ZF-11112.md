### Description

In Line 227 of abstract Zend\_Translate\_Adapter the options array evaluated of the key 'content'

if (!($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate) && !($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate\_Adapter)) { ...  
 }

When the key is not defined as index in options, php throws a notice

Notice: Undefined index: content in /home/ronny/svn/trunk/library/vendor/sources/ZendFramework-1.11.1-minimal/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 227

better is to check if the key exists

if (array\_key\_exists($options['content']) && !($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate) && !($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate\_Adapter)) { ...  
 }

'content' must always be given by the adapter as this is the translation content itself.

It is impossible that 'content' is not given because this would mean that you have nothing to translate. An empty translation object is not allowed as it would always return a warning as no single language would exist.

The adapter must in this case throw an exception.

It's been more than a month with no response from original reporter, so I have marked issue as resolved, not an issue.

Just a thought: Would it be a good idea to enforce the requirement of supplying a 'content' key? ie:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

             } else if (!is_array($options)) {
                 $options = array('content' => $options);
             }
    +
    +        if (!isset($options['content']) || empty($options['content'])) {
    +            require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
    +            throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Required option 'content' is missing");
    +        }
    
             $originate = null;
             if (!empty($options['locale'])) {

By requiring 'content' you seem to be insisting that custom adapters will use it. This is not always the case. I have an adapter that does real-time translation via a web service. It isn't relying on local files.

I believe it should be up to the individual adapter to decide if a certain option is required.
