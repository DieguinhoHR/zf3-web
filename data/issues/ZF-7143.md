### Description

Hello!

It would make the mail library much more useful if there was such a basic feature supported as e-mail deletion.

Thanks!

Removing mail messages is supported for Maildir, POP3 and IMAP since at least two years. Mbox is read only. If you need a local storage with write support use Maildir.

Yes, sorry. I searched for "delete" but it is described as "remove" instead. My fault. Here is the relevant reference to the documentation: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.read.html#zend.mail.read-fetching)
