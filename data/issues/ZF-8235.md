### Description

Ability to intercepting soap requests and responses will introduce the possibility of changing and logging soap messages before they reach they destination. This will be the first step to support WS-Security, WS-Addressing, message logging and other useful functionalities.

Possible solution:

Zend\_Soap\_Server\_Interceptor\_Interface : public function handleFault(DOMNode soapEnvelope), returns boolean ( true to continue processing of the request intercepting, false in other case ), throws Exception. public function handleRequest(DOMNode soapEnvelope), as above. public function handleResponse(DOMNode soapEnvelope), as above.

Zend\_Soap\_Server: public function addInterceptor(Zend\_Soap\_Server\_Interceptor\_Interface soapInterceptor) public function addInterceptors(array soapInterceptors)
