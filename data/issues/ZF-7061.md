### Description

Hi,

I'm using a custom smarty view class that I init in Bootstrap.php by \_initView() hooked function. So long I get it work fine by not using the view resource plugin.

But by starting to use menu navigation helper I run into a trap. That helper tries to access the view by the View Resource that hadn't been used by me.

It would be very nice and useful to get support for custom views. As workaround a public setView() function could be helpful to get getView() calls from "outside" supported. So custom View objected could be injected after initializing in Bootstrap's \_initX() functions.

related issue from navigation view helper: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6747>

best regards, marco
