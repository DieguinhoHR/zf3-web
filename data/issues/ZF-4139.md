It's not actualy Zend\_Loader problem, but some another which was masked by [ZF-4002].

Once [ZF-4002] was resolved it problem appears.

It also produces the following output: {panel} Catchable fatal error: Argument 1 passed to Zend\_Service\_Technorati\_Author::\_\_construct() must be an instance of DOMElement, string given in /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framewo rk/branches/release-1.6/library/Zend/Service/Technorati/Author.php on line 95 {panel}

And breaks Unit tests execution

The problem is actualy caused by PHPUnit patch applied earlie.

Patch affected set\_error\_handler() behavior for PHPUnit system. Sebastian Bergmann had a comment, that PHPUnit code was actually correct, but PHP had a documentation bug in a set\_error\_handler() description.

That's really so. The problem we had at that time was actually caused by [ZF-4002] issue. Patched PHPUnit produced output and behaviour mentionet above when [ZF-4002] was fixed.

Unit tests had passed correctly just after PHPUnit environment fix.

Nevertheless, several places, which need set\_error\_handler() processing improvement, were found while researching this issue. So it's still opened.
