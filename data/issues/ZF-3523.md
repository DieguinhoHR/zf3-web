### Description

Ive filed a sample test case(add zf1.5.2 to lib) where it appears that exception gets handled by error controller, and at the same time php complains about unhandled exception.

The issue does not appear when i take out Zend\_Layout::startMvc(...), from my bootstrap and the exception is handled properly...

I just tested this application that that error is coming up because it can't find the layout phtml file. Which is not handled by the view error controller. Once i created default.phtml file in the Application/Layouts folder that exception went away.

To me this is the expected action as you should have a layout there if you are going to be using the layout component.
