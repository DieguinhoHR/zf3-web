### Description

When using sfYaml as parse for a Zend\_Config\_Yaml, it won't parse embeded php in yaml config file.

In Zend\_Config\_Yaml::\_\_construct(), around line 167, it loaded the content of the config file into a variable, then pass it to the yaml decode function, in this case, sfYaml::load() will not parse the embeded php instructions.

Instead, the config file's path need to be passed to the decode function, and load the file content inside the function, then it will work well with sfYaml, or other yaml parser that requires a file path rather than a yaml string.

Could you provide a short code sample which reproduces your issue?
