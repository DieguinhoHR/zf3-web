### Description

simple boostrap with modules enabled

    $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $frontController->addModuleDirectory('.');
    $frontController->dispatch();

when calling url (global controller)

/index => file ./default/controllers/indexController.php is read, and class IndexController is loaded

but when calling :

/module1/index => file ./module1/controllers/indexController.php is read, and class Module1\_IndexController is loaded

Don't know if this is the wanted behaviour, but I find it misleading as we would expect the class name to follow the same naming rules indepently of the selected module (or global).

If this behaviour, is the correct one, maybe documentation ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.modular.html)) needs to draw attention on this particularity (with a note for example).

This is by design. The basic use case is that you only need a single directory for controllers, and that these do not need namespacing: NewsController, BlogController, etc. Namespace prefixing is only needed for encapsulated modules, which typically group application functionality into multiple controllers.

I'll mark this as a documentation enhancement, and make sure that this is clear in the conventional modular documentation chapter.

Resolved in r5300. Added the following note:

Note that in the default module, controllers do not need a namespace prefix. Thus, in the example above, the controllers in the default module do not need a prefix of 'Default\_' -- they are simply dispatched according to their base controller name: 'IndexController' and 'FooController'. A namespace prefix is used in all other modules, however.
