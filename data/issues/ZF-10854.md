ZF-10854: Replace @see with @group in bug-related test methods

### Description

Many bug-related test methods still reference the bug ID with @see rather than @group, or use the full bug-tracker URI instead of just the ID. The attached patch fixes these instances. I have tried my best not to disturb valid @see references.
