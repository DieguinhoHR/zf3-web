### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       /**
         * Constructor
         *
         * $spec may be:
         * - string: name of element
         * - array: options with which to configure element
         * - Zend_Config: Zend_Config with options for configuring element
         *
         * @param  string|array|Zend_Config $spec
         * @return void
         * @throws Zend_Form_Exception if no element name after initialization
         */
          public function __construct($spec, $options = null){


You see the @param for options is not here.

woops it was Zend\_Form\_Element, which was extended by Zend\_Form\_Element\_Xhtml, which I was extending...
