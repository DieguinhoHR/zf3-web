The fault reported in this issue occurs only if the domxml extension is enabled.

The domxml extension is for PHP 4, and it contains known conflicts with the PHP 5 DOM extension. The domxml extension is not supported, developed, or maintained anymore.

Based on what I have read in the following links, the PHP 5 DOM extension is better, faster, and it is a supported extension in PHP 5.

See: [http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2005/â€¦](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2005/11/06/domxml-and-php-5.html) <http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=6975>

Interesting...

I did not know this. We should look to have this and related problems written somewhere into our docu/confluence...
