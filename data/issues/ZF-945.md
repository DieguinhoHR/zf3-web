As non english speaker I want to translate... so I use Zend\_Translate to translate something.

Principle the name of the class can be such or such... I have no problem with renaming. But I need a decission from the devteam to do so.

Waiting for response...

As we discussed in ZF-944, I do not see this is a mandatory change.

By the same reasons listed for ZF-944, we generally plan to forgo user-facing API breaks in favor of maintaining backward compatibility.
