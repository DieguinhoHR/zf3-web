### Description

Several people use

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-01 10:10:10');


instead of defining the constant as declared within the docu

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-01 10:10:10', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);


The date should be automatically parsed to include the time within ISO when it's given.
