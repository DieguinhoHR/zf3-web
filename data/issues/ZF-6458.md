ZF-6458: Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller overwrites multiple controller directories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This is in reference to ticket ZF-6244, which I believe was misunderstood. Because Zend\_Controller\_Front::setControllerDirectory() clears any existing controller directories every time that it is invoked, using the foreach loop in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller:54, only the last directory in the array of controller directories will remain set, regardless of the uniqueness of the module => directory pairs you pass in. The solution that I see for this issue is to remove the foreach loop in the front controller resource, and just pass in the array (setControllerDirectory() accepts an array by default). I am using revision 15243 (1.8.0dev)

This is a patch removes the condition check for if $value is a string and just passes $value to Zend\_Controller\_Front::setControllerDirectory().

What's odd is that setControllerDirectory() is not written such that it should overwrite -- and yet I just verified that it does.

As a workaround until this is fixed, I'd recommend keeping your modules under a common directory, and using the moduleDirectory configuration key instead of controllerDirectory.

I was mistaken when I first made the report. It's not in Zend\_Controller\_Front::setControllerDirectory(). It's actually in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard::setControllerDirectory(). It's the first line of the method, and it assigns an empty array to $this->\_controllerDirectory. Apologies for the confusion. :)

IMHO this is a very high priority bug: for existing ZF based applications with multiple modules it's nearly impossible to upgrade to the 1.8 release.

To make the problem even more clear: using the new Zend\_Application, if you create an .ini file with these lines:

[production] includePaths.library = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../library" bootstrap.path = APPLICATION\_PATH "/Bootstrap.php" bootstrap.class = "Bootstrap" resources.frontController.controllerDirectory.default = APPLICATION\_PATH "/default/controllers" resources.frontController.controllerDirectory.module1 = APPLICATION\_PATH "/module1/controllers"

than the _Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller_ invokes the Frontcontroller's _setControllerDirectory_ which in turn invokes the Dispatcher method _setControllerDirectory_ which resets the internal \_\_controllerDirectory\_ array each time it's called.

The solution is really simple: Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller should use _addControllerDirectory_ in stead of _setControllerDirectory_. For your convenience I've attached a patch file.

Fixed in trunk and 1.8 release branch.
