ZF-10902: Missing translation support in JQuery view helpers and decorators

### Description

ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Decorator\_UiWidgetElement does not set translator in its render() method. Similarly ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_UiWidget does not implement translation since it is deriving directly from Zend\_View\_Helper\_HtmlElement instead of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement.

bq. ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Decorator\_UiWidgetElement does not set translator in its render() method.

Decorator should not be aware of translator or translations and nor is Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Decorator\_DijitElement::render(), which is equivalent with ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Decorator\_UiWidgetElement::render().

ZendX\_JQuery's UiWidget view helper is extended similarly than Zend\_Dojo's Dijit view helper so I guess that the problem is not in view helpers neither.

Could you provide some more info or code which details the problem.

But Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper is aware of translator - see lines 242:244 $helperObject = $view->getHelper($helper); if (method\_exists($helperObject, 'setTranslator')) { $helperObject->setTranslator($element->getTranslator()); }

and this allows view helpers deriving from Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement to translate something when rendering... other examples are: Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormElement, Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect, Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle

My problem is that I am writing a from element + view helper for a jQuery plugin and I would like to translate something during rendering like other non-jquery view helpers can.
