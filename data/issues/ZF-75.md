### Description

Current versions of documentation/api are not available.

Versions based on SVN could be created frequently and either published on the website, integrated into the manual, etc.

Also, some would appreciate a graphical class inheritance tree.

phpDocumentor-generated API documentation is now available online for the Zend Framework.

For the core components:

<http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core>

For the incubator components:

<http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/incubator>

There are also links to these in the sidebar on the right side of the Zend Framework manual:

<http://framework.zend.com/manual>

Though the process is not completely automated, we do now have phpDocumentor-generated API documentation available on the framework website, including class trees.
