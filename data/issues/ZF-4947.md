### Description

Since all Zend\_Form\_Elements use Zend\_View\_Interface to render output, so should Captcha.

Could you elaborate?

The Captcha adapters all already accept a Zend\_View\_Interface argument. However, the difference is that they have some hard-coded HTML in them. You can override this by extending the captcha adapters in your local namespace and overriding the render() method.
