ZF-10624: When creating an ATOM feed, the link is used to create the id field of the feed. This can generate errors when link is not URL encoded.

### Description

Possible correction is to use an extra field ID id in the Zend\_Feed\_Abstract::\_mapFeedHeaders.

By default ID is set with the link attribute but can be overwritten if one implements its own ZEnd\_Feed\_Builder.

Hope this helps.

Happy coding :)

Hey Paddy, does this make sense to you?

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
