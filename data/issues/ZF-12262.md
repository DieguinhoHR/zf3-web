### Description

This issue is not related to ZF documentation but there is no category matching this kind of issue. In all branches and tags README.txt files one can see :

RELEASE INFORMATION
-------------------

Zend Framework 1.11.11 Release ([INSERT REV NUM HERE]). Released on , .

Though, I think advising these informations could really help people, companies or tools interacting with ZF SVN
