### Description

When I display a password field in a view script, the field value is remembered and thus shows up in the HTML source code. I think it is bad practice to fill in password fields when the form validation fails, because it exposes the password in plain text in the HTML source code.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    For now I fixed it in my view script by changing the password field value to an empty string before calling prepare()


$form = $this->form; /\*\* Remove password value for security \*/ $form->get( 'password' )->setValue( '' ); $form->setAttribute( 'action', $this->url() ) ->prepare();```

In my opinion the method Zend\\Form\\Form::prepare() which calls Zend\\Form\\Fieldset::prepareElement() should take care of this and remove the value if the field is a password field to prevent the exposure of passwords.

Look at ZF1: [renderPassword](http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftags%2Frelease-1.12.0%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FView%2FHelper%2FFormPassword.php) in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormPassword.
