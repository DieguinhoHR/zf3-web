### Description

You should call close() method before reference has gone if you use Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli statement.

This should be noted on it. [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter.adapter-notes)

If you do not call, you may receive a message at next use of the database. The message is "Commands out of sync; You can't run this command now". This will cause a problem you hard to find out.

The destructor check could avoid the issue.

The Statement sample something like this.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $statement = $select->query();
    try {
        $data = $statement->fetchAll();
        // ...
    
        if (method_exists($statement, 'close')) {
            $statement->close();
        }
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        try {
            // Mysqli
            if (method_exists($statement, 'close')) {
                $statement->close();
            }
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            // ignore close error
        }
        throw $e;
    }

Does this issue depends on ZF-3984? I think this could be solved if ZF-3984 would be cleared.

In my search, it does not depend on ZF-3984. Only guide may be needed.

i'm not sure if not-calling close causes a big issue with the current release. if not, the destructor does not have to check.
