ZF-6182: Zend\_Soap\_Client can not call function/method
--------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-04-01T08:28:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-02T08:05:07.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When trying to use Zend\_Soap\_Client it get an error: "Operation '' is not defined in the WSDL for this service".

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $soapClient = new Zend_Soap_Client('<a href="http://xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx/soap?wsdl">http://xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx/soap?wsdl</a>');
    $authCode = $soapClient->login('JustMe', 'JustMyPass');


When using the SoapClient directly it just works fine:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $soapClient = new SoapClient('<a href="http://xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx/soap?wsdl">http://xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx/soap?wsdl</a>');
    $authCode = $soapClient->login('JustMe', 'JustMyPass');


When debugging is see that Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common::\_\_doRequest() doesn't get it's parameters.

Strange, because Zend\_Soap\_Client simply uses SoapClient, isn't it?

I am terribly sorry.

The specs that the company (with SOAP interface) send me are wrong! They stated to be SOAP1.2, but it had to be SOAP1.1.

Well, luckely I changed that as a last resort after submitting the 'bug'.

This can be removed/closed or whatever....
