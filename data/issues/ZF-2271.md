### Description

The return value of glob() changed in PHP 5.2.5 when no matches are found (now returns false). See <http://www.php.net/glob>.

This causes an "Invalid argument supplied for foreach()" on line 281 in release 1.0.3, as well as any other place in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File where the return value of glob() is iterated using a foreach loop.
