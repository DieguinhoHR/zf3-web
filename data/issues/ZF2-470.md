### Description

RestClient implement an older class (Zend\\Service\\AbstractService) removed from the main zf2 repository (since commit <[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/d0eba227d0a7a2bb08ad07c44f97a012448aca4)>). Didn't found the related compoment Zend\\Service in zf2 (removed, u remember? :p) or in zendframework repositories.

AbstractService for RestClient is not really a mandatory abstract class but, I'm not really sure. I think that the good path is to have one ;)
