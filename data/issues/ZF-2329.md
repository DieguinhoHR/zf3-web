ZF-2329: Zend\_Cache should remember HTTP headers (Content-Type) when using Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page

### Description

Example: An XML document is output with the Content-Type header set to text/xml. Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page is used and when retrieving a cached copy, the Content-Type header is incorrectly set to text/html.

See <http://xeaura.xeaura-host.co.uk/sitemap.xml> for an example. The cache time is about 15 seconds. Initiall you will see the document with the correct content-type (and correctly formatted in Firefox), refreshing will give you the cached copy (wrong content-type and not formatted in Firefox).

Zend\_Cache doesn't send Content-Type header.

Something like this should work, no ?

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    
    require 'Zend/Cache.php')
    [...] we make $cache object
    
    header("Content-Type...");
    
    $cache->start()
    
    require_once 'Model.php'
    [...]
    
    [...] your work to make the XML file
    echo($xmlString);

It's a possible solution but that wouldn't work in my case or most common cases when using Zend\_Controller.

In my case the module/controller/action route will determine the Content-Type header which will be set on the Response object. Since Zend\_Cache is setup in the bootstrap, it does not go through the entire route sequence to determine what the Content-Type should be.

As it stands your solution would work for a lot of cases when using Zend\_Cache/Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page in a simple application. However, when using Zend\_Cache/Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page with Zend\_Controller you are essentially limited to produce text/html responses.

I just commited a change for this into the SVN trunk

please try it (you will have to set the backend option content\_type\_memorization = true) and reopen this task if problem

regards

The new Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page class definately works in my case. The Content-Type header is correctly remembered and sent along with the cached output.

The content\_type\_memorization is a frontend option, not a backend one.

Thanks for this fix!

Problem is not limited to Content-type header; other important headers (Expires, for example) are also lost. Is there any good reason not to remember and re-use _all_ response headers for cached pages? The patch is even simpler than the patch to add content\_type\_memorization. Just save the entire headers\_list() array in the cache and spit them all back.

Can I close this bug? Have all issues been resolved? It's not entirely clear from the comments.

Yes Wil, you can close it
