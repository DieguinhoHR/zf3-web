### Description

When uploading an existing file from a directory that contains space in it's name, the uploaded file's name is actually the part of the directory before the space instead of the expected file's name.

Reporduction code: (create a file named /tmp/With Space/wow.txt):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="http://localhost/Framework/tests/testUploads.php">http://localhost/Framework/tests/testUploads.php</a>');
    $client->setFileUpload('/tmp/With Space/wow.txt', 'somefile');
    
    $res = $client->request('POST');
    echo $res->getBody() . "\n";
