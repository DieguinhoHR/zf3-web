### Description

The Pdo\_Mssql driver supports alternate prefixes in the DSN. - "mssql:" is for Microsoft SQL Server. This is currently the only prefix supported by the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql adapter. - "sybase:" is for FreeTDS and Sybase. - "dblib:" is for other dblib-based drivers.

This is a feature request to support the second and third prefixes mentioned above.
