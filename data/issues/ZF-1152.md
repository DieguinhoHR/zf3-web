ZF-1152: Inconsistent method names - asArray() and toArray()

### Description

In order to unify Zend's class APIs, I'd propose to rename Zend\_Config::asArray() to Zend\_Config::toArray(). This would match the names of the methods in Zend\_Db\_Table (row) and Zend\_Console\_Getopt.

Inconsistency affects multiple components. The question of whether to name the Zend\_Config method asArray() or toArray() came up during the design of Zend\_Config.

I don't recall the reasons for choosing asArray() at the moment, but obviously we now have inconsistencies that should be resolved.

Deferring to Rob for additional comment.

I have no recollection why we chose asArray() tbh. I suspect it depends on your point of view. From the config's point of view, it is providing the data as an array. From the callers point of view, it is instructing the config to assign the data into an array

I'm not religious on it, so toArray is fine with me :)

I really have no preference either - I am also fine with changing Zend\_Console\_Getopt and Zend\_Db\_Table. ;-)) I just _thought_ one name would be more ideal.

Fixed in svn 4263.

asArray() is marked deprecated and toArray() is now available.

Removing Zend\_Console\_Getopt and Zend\_Db from the components list.

Setting fix version to 0.9.2.
