ZF-7080: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form and name attribute issue

### Description

the name attribute was deprecated in version 1.7.3 of the Zend Framework in line with the XHTML spec: <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10>

however the w3schools reference shows this attribute as still valid: [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag\_form.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp)

My suggestion would be to either alter the $name attribute for the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form to $id, as the following line:

$this->\_getInfo($name, $content, $attribs)

uses $name as $id if the id is not set in the attributes, or more preferably (if backwards compatibility is required) set the argument to:

$name = null

and add a check to see if it's not null throwing an exception if the if statement is true to stop developers from trying to apply a name attribute.

w3schools !== W3 Consortium. The official specification is at <www.w3.org>.

Also, an interesting point: the HTML specification actually allows for arbitrary attributes in tags -- which makes expressly forbidding the addition of a "name" attribute a bit moot.

I do understand that w3schools is not W3 Consortium, I was just pointing this out to show that some users may not understand from using w3schools as to why the cannot add a name to the form tag

Your second comment would to me imply this code is actually broken and invalid.

You cannot add a name tag to a form the way the code currently is, whether that be via the $name variable, or via the attributes.

The $name does nothing now as this is never set on the element due to the code being removed, and via attributes it is removed from the array by $this->\_getInfo as it is expecting name to be set separately and not wanting repeated attributes.

surely if your view is correct we should be allowing developers to add a name tag if they would like one?
