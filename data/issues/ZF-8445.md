ZF-8445: Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container->registerDijitLoader conflict
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

FILE: Zend\\Dojo\\View\\Helper\\Dojo\\Container.php FUNCTION: Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container->registerDijitLoader() LINE: 795 :: dojo.parser.parse();

conflicts with controller setting: $this->view->dojo()->setDjConfigOption('parseOnLoad', true);

so widgets get parsed 2 times and js produces an error in the first widget which was parsed before and the rest of the script isn't executed...

solution: check if djConfigOption('parseOnLoad') is false and then call dojo.parser.parse()...

Or you could simply not set the djConfig option if you're using declarative syntax anyways... It's well documented that this is the behavior, so I'm not entirely convinced the change is necessary. Can you provide some background as to why you might need both?

on this system, some special users can contribute some simple html code... no
