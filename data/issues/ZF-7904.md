ZF-7904: invalid use of reference objects in AMF serializer
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-21T03:46:17.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:09.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

the object reference mechanism in AMF serialization is broken the problemn described in ZF-7634 is just a special case of the problem but the problem exists for all objects and arrays

details: the current serializer (in Amf/Parse/Amf3/Serializer.php) treats object as the same if they have the same value, this is wrong, instead objects should be compared by identity (obj1 === obj2), the builtin function array\_search(...) compares objects/arrays by value and should therefore not be used here

a correct implementation would allow to transfer object graphs (sibling relation, child/parents relations) and furthermore would likely much faster (no comparision by value required or even helpful)

Hi Mario,

I'm sorry, but this is not entirely correct. You're right, that the comparison has to be done with ===. But that's exactly what is done by setting the third parameter of array\_search to true. So object referencing should work. But ZF-7634 is still valid. I'll comment on that there...

Cheers Stefan

Hi Stefan,

you are right regarding the === operator. Today I have learned more about the === operator in PHP. It does a comparision based on value and type. I thought it would do a pointer comparision in the sense of C/C++. But this is not the case and this is exactly the problem. All objects/arrays with the same value are treated as identical during AMF serialization. This leads to arkward situations in a Flex client if by accident unrelated object/arrays have the same value in PHP. Regarding ZF-7634, this is really just a special case of a much bigger problem! The problem exists for arbitrary complex arrays and objects. The implemented object referencing mechanism is just to eager. I'm working on a solution and i will send a possible bug fix later.

Greetings, Mario

Hello,

sorry gays. I'm not able to provide a bug fix which solves the problem for all situations. In my project it was good enough to disable the referencing mechanism for arrays. But I could not find a general solution for the referencing mechanism.

Now I want to believe it is a problem of PHP. If PHP had a function to attach a unique ID to an object a solution would be easy. For the time being I'm giving up on this problem.

Greetings, Mario
