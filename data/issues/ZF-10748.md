ZF-10748: MD2 no longer supported by OpenSSL - remove support from Zend\_Crypt?

### Description

Unit tests fail on some platforms (mine is Ubuntu 10.10 running PHP 5.3.3) because OPENSSL\_ALGO\_MD2 is no longer defined. This is because the OpenSSL library has discontinued MD2 because it is insecure. Should all support of MD2 be removed from Zend\_Crypt as well? It will be non functional on these platforms anyway.

The specific unit test failure:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Zend_Crypt_RsaTest::testConstructorSetsHashOption
    Use of undefined constant OPENSSL_ALGO_MD2 - assumed 'OPENSSL_ALGO_MD2'
    
    /library/Zend/Crypt/Rsa.php:267
    library/Zend/Crypt/Rsa.php:106
    /library/Zend/Crypt/Rsa.php:82
    /tests/Zend/Crypt/Rsa/RsaTest.php:138
