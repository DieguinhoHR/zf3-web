ZF-12101: Zend\_Db\_Table Check for Primary Key Doesn't First Check Table Exists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The \_setupPrimaryKey() method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract checks for a primary key with the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // if no primary key was specified and none was found in the metadata
    // then throw an exception.
    if (empty($this->_primary)) {
        // require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Exception.php';
        throw new Zend_Db_Table_Exception('A table must have a primary key, but none was found');
    }


If you have a model setup for a table that doesn't exist, the above exception is thrown. While it's true that the primary key doesn't exist for a table that also doesn't exist, it would be nice to have a more descriptive exception like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Check table exists
    if ( !count($this->getAdapter()->describeTable($this->_name)) ) {
        throw new Zend_Db_Table_Exception(sprintf("No table by name '%s' found", $this->_name));
    }
    
    // if no primary key was specified and none was found in the metadata
    // then throw an exception.
    if (empty($this->_primary)) {
        // require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Exception.php';
        throw new Zend_Db_Table_Exception('A table must have a primary key, but none was found');
    }
