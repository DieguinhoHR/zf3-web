### Description

While working with the Zend\_Form and view scripts it is often very useful being able to quickly print label tags, like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    as opposed to the code currently required:

This improvement will be useful where the label decorator isn't appropriate. For example, sometimes the label isn't desired immediately before or after the form element, and placement from within a view script or view script decorator is the simplest way to go. It will also be useful for those who aren't using decorators at all.

Here's a unit test (please let me know if this needs improvement in any way, this is a learning process for me):

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function testZendFormElementInteroperability()
        {
            require_once 'Zend/Form/Element.php';
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element('foo', array('disableLoadDefaultDecorators' => true));
            $element->setLabel('bar');
            
            $label = 'bar';
            $this->assertEquals($this->helper->formLabel($element), $label);
        }

Please categorize/fix as needed.

I am inclined to say that at current, making the form\*() helpers Zend\_Form aware is not a level of coupling that we would like to see implemented without fully exploring all the possibilities.

Something on this magnitude should be proposed through the proposal process. B/c if we are gonna do it to one form view helper, then we must do it to all form view helpers.

Scheduling for next minor release.

Any solution should address all form helpers, as Ralph suggests, to ensure that we have a consistent story for using view helpers with form objects.
