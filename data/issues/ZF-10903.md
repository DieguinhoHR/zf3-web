### Description

Element labels are translated twice! Once in Zend\_Form\_Element::getLabel() and second time in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label::getLabel() called by Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label::render(). This appears in log (when resources.translate.logUntranslated = true is set in application.ini):

Untranslated message within 'en': Submit Untranslated message within 'en': Submit
