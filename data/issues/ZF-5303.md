ZF-5303: Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract doesn't determine hashing capabilities correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-12-18T01:28:52.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-18T02:29:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract throws an Exception whenever the getHash Method is being called. This is because the hashing capabilities aren't correctly determined. The array that is returned by hash\_algos is indexed and not an associative array. Therefore in\_array should be used rather than the check for a certain key.

Affected Line in code: 1056

Edit: Here's a patch to fix the issue
=====================================
