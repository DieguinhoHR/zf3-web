### Description

I'm not sure if this is too much of a niche need, but I certainly would have use for the ability to disable auto-escaping for the fieldset's legendString, e.g. "**Optional:** Description goes here".

You should be able to write your own Label decorator and assign it to your form elements.

Although, I don't really see the need for this in your case, you can just edit your CSS file and add:

label { font-weight: bold; }

and you will achieve the same effect without hacking your html.

Goran -- the reporter indicates that the issue is with the fieldset, which does allow adding inline tags. This is a valid request -- we have escape flags in many other view helpers at this point.

Right, because Goran's solution would bold the entire label, and some people only want (for example) the text prefix "Optional:" within the label bolded.

Fixed in trunk and 1.6 release branch; will release in 1.6.1.
