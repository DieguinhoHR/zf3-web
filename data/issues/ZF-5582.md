### Description

Line 295 of Zend/Service/Akismet.php contains an invalid URL: ".rest.askimet.com".

When one tries to use this service, an "Invalid URI Specified" exception is thrown from Uri/Http.php.

It can be fixed simply by removing the "." in front of the URL.

Please close this issue. This was an error on my side. I apologize for submitting a bogus bug -- I thought I had checked every possible aspect before submitting it, but that was not the case. It works as is. Again, I apologize.
