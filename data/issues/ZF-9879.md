ZF-9879: Zend Controller Router Route's assemble method incorectly encodes slashes for use with url rewriting.

### Description

Calling Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::assemble with $encode set to true and url rewriting enabled, if a parameter contains a slash, will return something like:

<http://www.domain.tld/Index/Search/q/%2Fquery>

The resulting URL being invalid, it is rejected by Apache (and possibly other servers) before any rewriting attempt is even made. The supposed correct syntax is:

<http://www.domain.tld/Index/Search/q/%252Fquery>

However this leads to q's value being "%2Fquery", and therefore would also need extra processing when reading parameters from URL.

It is because an (odd?) Apache (2.x?) behavior. Here is the reason and the solution: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/…](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes)

Setting ``` in the Apache configuration is a solution. Be careful because this directive must be given in server config or virtual host context.

If this is considered a good solution, this bug could be a documentation lack.
