ZF2-298: ServiceManager : Configuration & abstract factories
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Components target is Zend\\Module because Zend\\ServiceManager don't exist.

• In Zend\\ServiceManager\\Configuration, configureServiceManager() call setInvokable but the method name is setInvokableClass().

• In has() method in Zend\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager, abstract factories are iterated, so abstract factory with string name are not supported.

I will propose a PR to fix that.
