### Description

All ZF components should be loosely coupled and be able to be used alone without other components if possible.

Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Header for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Validate_EmailAddress');


A simple require\_once would be faster and would decouple it from Zend\_Loader.

There are a few other places in Zend\_Feed where this should also be decoupled.

Zend\_Feed (line 380) Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Header\_Itunes (line 115) Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Header (lines 178, 249, 272)
