ZF-4870: Zend\_Tool - Wrong exception class thrown in ZendL\_Tool\_Rpc\_Endpoint\_Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-11-07T15:04:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-24T11:03:11.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

In class in method there are two lines:

throw new ZendL\_Tool\_Endpoint\_Exception('Endpoint failed to setup the action name.'); throw new ZendL\_Tool\_Endpoint\_Exception('Endpoint failed to setup the provider name.');

these should probably be:

throw new ZendL\_Tool\_Rpc\_Endpoint\_Exception('Endpoint failed to setup the action name.'); throw new ZendL\_Tool\_Rpc\_Endpoint\_Exception('Endpoint failed to setup the provider name.');

(Zend\_Tool from 1.6.2 Bundle)

This was fixed in previous incarations where RPC was renamed to the "Client".

Please see that your needs are met within the Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client system.
