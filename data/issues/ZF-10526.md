### Description

When Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Simple is in use[1], and Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug is enabled in any Zend\_Db\_Adapter[2], application, trying to log SQL queries via firebug, crashes in nasty way[3]. The reason is that method Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders::isReady() does not make sure if current request object is HTTP one (which is mandatory to log anything through firebug), and one of required methods is missing.

As a quick workaround I made some changes in Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders::isReady() method[4], but I believe there must be a much better way to achieve it. The bug exists (at least) in 1.10.2 and 1.10.8 - those are the versions I tried.

- - - - - -

[1] In index.php or any other script starting application: $front->setRequest(new Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Simple(...))

[2] For example in Bootstrap: $profiler = new Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug; $profiler->setEnabled(true);

$db->setProfiler($profiler);

[3] The result is: Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Simple::getHeader() in (...)/Zend/Wildfire/Channel/HttpHeaders.php on line 276

[4] My changes in Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders::isReady() (at the beginning od method's body): if(false === $this->getRequest() instanceof Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http) { return false; }

Please verify patch before I merge to 1.10 branch.

This fix causes the following strict error: "is\_a(): Deprecated. Please use the instanceof operator" to be triggered on PHP < 5.3.

Thanks for the heads up.

See here for discussion: [http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Use-of-is-a-td2990280.html)

I'll implement recommendation once decided.

Christoph: ZF is supposed to run under E\_STRICT, which means any method raising an E\_DEPRECATED needs to be fixed. Please use "instanceof" in this case -- it takes into account inheritance, and is the proper mechanism.

is\_a needs to be fixed.

Using 'instanceof' instead of is\_a() now.
