ZF-7026: Zend\_Captcha\_Image broken on Mac OS X

### Description

The Zend\_Captcha\_Image class is broken on Mac OS X. I am trying to follow examples from a book titled "Practical Web 2.0 Appliations in PHP" that uses the Zend Framework and one chapter deals with using CAPTCHAs. When I generate the CAPTCHA, it causes Zend to return a completely blank response the the web browser. If I exclude this from the form, it generates the form just fine. Zend\_Captcha\_Figlet works fine (just to make sure I am doing things correctly). It also doesn't generate an image in public/images/captcha (the folder specified by imgDir). The folder has mode 777 so anything can be written there so that isn't the problem. I think it may be in the phase where the image is generated, but I don't get any error output. Will attach example code as soon as I can that exemplifies the problem.

This actually turns out to be a problem with using PHP on Mac OS X and Apple's version of FreeType. Please close this bug as invalid.
