### Description

Making calls using:

$this->textBox( "file\_title[{$asset->id}]" );

So that they come through to the parameters as indexed arrays for tabular data. When the elements are written to the browser the ids run through the \_normalizeId() method but when written to the zendDijits array they are not. This results in the form elements not being dojo initialised.

Changing Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/Dijit.php:288 - $this->dojo->setDijit($id, $params); + $this->dojo->setDijit($this->\_normalizeId( $id ), $params);

Resolves this issue but it may not be the best place to put this.

I selected the version the project is currently running and future ones, I've only checked future versions by eye and not tested them.
