ZF-988: fetchAll ORDER BY clause no longer working

### Description

When I upgraded my application from Zend 0.6 to 0.8, I was unable to use any in-line Postgresql functions in my ORDER clauses.

For instance, the following (pseudo) code worked in Zend 0.6: {quote} $where = '1=1'; $order = 'lower(name)'; $my\_object = $my\_zend\_db\_tabel->fetchAll($where, $order); {quote}

Now, as of Zend 0.8, the above returns the following error: {quote} PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[42703]: Undefined column: 7 ERROR: column "lower(name)" does not exist' {quote}

If I change the code to the following, it will work: {quote} $where = '1=1'; $order = 'name'; $my\_object = $my\_zend\_db\_tabel->fetchAll($where, $order); {quote}

Is this a bug or a feature? Perhaps it is new problem with the PDO PostgreSQL driver?

We are trying to implement best practices and promote usage of more secure SQL syntax, by quoting column names wherever we can in the Zend\_Db classes. This also helps if SQL identifiers contain special characters.

The default behavior of Zend\_Db is to assume that the argument to the order() method is a column name, and thus should be quoted to reduce risk of SQL injection vulnerability.

I have implemented a class so that strings that should not be quoted can be distinguished from plain column names. You should be able to use expressions instead of column names this way:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $where = '1=1';
    $order = new Zend_Db_Expr('lower(name)');
    $my_object = $my_zend_db_tabel->fetchAll($where, $order);


Objects of type Zend\_Db\_Expr are not quoted; the string value is used verbatim.

Thank you for the information. It is much appreciated.

Resolving this issue as "not an issue." This is more an issue of usage. The product works as intended (in its current design).

This does not work either. I get the same error.

Should I open another issue, or post the details here?

Could this be one of the difference between a Zend\_Db\_Select object and Zend\_Db\_Table object?

Reopened pending solution that works.

Fixed in revision 3677.

Now Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchAll() should handle arguments of type Zend\_Db\_Expr for the second argument, the $order criteria.
