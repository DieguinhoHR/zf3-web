ZF-6715: PHP 5.3 RC and PDF Image Jpeg

### Description

8: Undefined index: JPG Support in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Pdf/Resource/Image/Jpeg.php on line 60

results in:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Pdf\_Exception' with message 'JPG support is not configured properly.' in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Pdf/Resource/Image/Jpeg.php:62

The options array of GD Version says:

array(11) { ["GD Version"]=> string(27) "bundled (2.0.34 compatible)" ["FreeType Support"]=> bool(false) ["T1Lib Support"]=> bool(true) ["GIF Read Support"]=> bool(true) ["GIF Create Support"]=> bool(true) ["JPEG Support"]=> bool(true) ["PNG Support"]=> bool(true) ["WBMP Support"]=> bool(true) ["XPM Support"]=> bool(true) ["XBM Support"]=> bool(true) ["JIS-mapped Japanese Font Support"]=> bool(true) }

So there is just a missing "E" in the if condition.

this bug is still present in version 1.8.4 Setup: ZendFramework: 1.8.4 PHP 5.3.0 [GD Version] => bundled (2.0.34 compatible) [FreeType Support] => 1 [FreeType Linkage] => with freetype [T1Lib Support] => [GIF Read Support] => 1 [GIF Create Support] => 1 [JPEG Support] => 1 ...

should be a really easy fix? line 59 in ZendFramework/library/Zend/Pdf/Resource/Image/Jpeg.php add 'E' to JPG
