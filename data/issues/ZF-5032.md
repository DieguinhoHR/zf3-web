### Description

It's no need to use ReflectionClass.. Just implement in this way

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _getDecorator($name, $options)
        {
            $class = $this->getPluginLoader(self::DECORATOR)->load($name);
            $decorator = new $class($options);
          
           return $decorator;
        }


It's faster and easy to read and understand than Reflection API..
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes , It's been fixed up in newest version .. Efficient working.. ^ ^

I've been looking through all the source files in package Zend\_Form these days , and that much duplicate code were found in Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup and Zend\_Form\_Element...In my opinion , this is not a good design for maintenance,but since it has been published in use u can hardly redesign to improve.. BTW : Why I cant post comment? Because it's been fixed?

You're right -- that's a remnant from an earlier iteration where we were allowing passing multiple arguments to decorator constructors.

Thanks for the report!

Please look at the revisions I posted; they fix not only Zend\_Form, but Zend\_Form\_Element and Zend\_Form\_DisplayGroup.
