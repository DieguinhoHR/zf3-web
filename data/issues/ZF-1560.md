### Description

User reporting issue with timezone offset ('-05') being stripped when calling Zend\_Gdata\_CalendarEventQuery::setStartMin and setStartMax. It appears that the formatTimestamp function is stripping this data.

Problem reported at: [http://groups.google.com/group/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/google-calendar-help-dataapi/browse_thread/thread/5ff89f7663b5a137/a423e6be45239b62#a423e6be45239b62)

Fixed in rev 5396 by adding a regex to detect a pre-formatted RFC3339 date and not reformat if that's the case.

Ryan, There's a problem with this fix. The new regex doesn't check for end of line properly, so any string that contains NNNN-NN-NN will match, regardless of what comes after. Also, RFC 3339 allows for the following two things which this won't match against: \* The 'T' and 'Z' may be lowercase. \* Milliseconds may be specified with arbitrary precision.

I've emailed you an updated regex which will should resolve these three things.

My last comment wasn't complete. I meant to say any string that contains NNNN-NN-NN(.\*).
