### Description

When you add a ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Element\_Slider element in a subform, you've a problem this the html render, the name of the hidden field isn't correct:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 


Instead of this, you should have this content:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 


It's a problem when you validate the form, the name is wrong, you loose the values.

Thanks for your feedback.

Hi Ludovic,

this is a known problem. I've already uploaded a Patch for this.

regards René

_Edit:_ There is already an implementation for array notation. Have a look at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.advanced.html)

So you should use setBelongsTo and/or setIsArray.

best regards René

I've tested with your patch, Zend\_Form::setIsArray($flag) and Zend\_Form::setElementsBelongTo($array), nothing works.

I've tested without our patch too.

For all Zend\_Form standard elements, it works, except of ZendX\_JQuery\_Form\_Element\_Slider, I've always the same issue.

Are you sure it isn't an issue ?

Do you need a source code example to demonstrate the presence of this bug ?
