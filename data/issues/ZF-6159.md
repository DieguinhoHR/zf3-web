ZF-6159: Zend\_Db\_Table - lower sequence name
----------------------------------------------

### Description

I think there is small bug in Zend\_Db\_Table. Sequences declared as camelCase are lowercased.

Database Postgresql, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql

class camelCase extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract { protected $\_name = 'camelCase';

 
    #Forcing declaration does not have any effect


protected $\_sequence = 'camelCase\_id\_seq'; }

$table = new camelCase(); $row = $camelCase->createRow(); ...some data $row->save();

Exception: Relation 'camelcase\_id\_seq' not found.
