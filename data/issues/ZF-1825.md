### Description

In the reference guide, you can found this explanation regarding exception class whitelisting: {quote} If you utilize an exception class that your other project exceptions inherit, you can then whitelist a whole family of exceptions at a time. {quote} But the actual code to check if an exception is whitelisted or not is the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $exceptionClass   = get_class($e);
    if (isset(self::$_faultExceptionClasses[$exceptionClass])) {
        $code    = $e->getCode();
        $message = $e->getMessage();
    }


As you can see, it doesn't check parent classes so ie a Zend\_Exception would generate an "Unknown Error" Fault, even if "Exception" itself is whitelisted.

I've solved this issue replacing the above code block with this one:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach (array_keys(self::$_faultExceptionClasses) as $class) {
        if ($e instanceof $class) {
            $code    = $e->getCode();
            $message = $e->getMessage();
            break;
        }
    }


As a side note, I see no point on storing whitelisted exception classes as array keys instead of values anymore, but I'm not a php performance expert ;)
