ZF-3317: Store reference to locale
----------------------------------

### Description

Currently, setLocale() parses out the information it needs from the supplied locale. This is problematic when trying to change the locale.

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale = new Zend_Locale('en_US');
    $translate = new Zend_Translate(array(), $locale);
    $locale->setLocale('fr_CA');
    echo $translate->getLocale() // en_US


It would be nice if Zend\_Translate stored the locale by reference instead of breaking it apart. I only see one problem refactoring the code, pertaining to the:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!array_key_exists($locale, $this->_translate) and empty($this->_translate[$locale])) {
                $temp = explode('_', $locale);
                if (!array_key_exists($temp[0], $this->_translate)) {
                    /**
                     * @see Zend_Translate_Exception
                     */
                    require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
                    throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Language ({$locale}) has to be added before it can be used.");
                }
                $locale = $temp[0];
            }


Obviously, some additional logic would be required to automatically downgrade the Locale object.

This would not work.

\*) You can have multiple locales. When you add new translation files, each one with a locale object, which one should be referenced ? There is no way to select this.

\*) What should be done when you change the language of your locale object to a unsupported language ? Actually a exception is raised, but this could not be done when coupling the locale object. This leads to unexpected behaviour in translation.

\*) What if you change the locale object in the middle of a translation ? Your translation would change the language which is not wished.

The decission to NOT HARD-COUPLE locale with translation was made because of this reasons in past and serveral more...

Interesting... all good points. My approach of passing a single locale object around my classes is obviously not the correct approach. I obviously need to re-approach the problem from a different angle.

Let's say, to reference a single locale may fit perfectly in your case. But for the framework we must be more generic.

And as you already mentioned it's easy to have only a single locale within your application if you code it right.

We will close this issue as "won't fix"... feel free to add new improvements anytime.
