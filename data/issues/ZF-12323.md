I'm afraid that this broke tests on my Windows. (Windows 7 HP 64bit, PHP 5.3.8, PHPUnit 3.4.15)

This fixes failing tests for me.

Hi Martin, normally I work on Mac OS X, but after some tests with a old windows machine (Windows XP, PHP 5.2.17, PHPUnit 3.4), I had some errors.

I'll be looking at that again. Thanks for your feedback!
