ZF-4705: Zend\_Db::factory() is very strict on the string format for 'adapter' and 'adapterNamespace'

### Description

Zend\_Db::factory() uses

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapterName = strtolower($adapterNamespace . '_' . $adapter);
    $adapterName = str_replace(' ', '_', ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', $adapterName)));


to sanitize the strings given to the method when resolving the full class name of the adapter to load.

Well, now I'm at the point where I must use the string UserDb as the adapter and ISHD\_Auth\_Db as the adapterNamespace (ISHD is an acronym like IBM e.g. and should be written all-uppercase). This works quite well on Windows (development) as filenames and directory names are case-insensitive but on \*nix (production server) Zend\_Loader fails to load class Ishd\_Auth\_Db\_Userdb due to its case-sensitivity.

If there is no specific reason why this strict string format Abc\_Defg\_Hijk must be enforced, this sanitizing should be removed.

PS: I currently do not know which other ZF components use a similar sanitizing procedure that results in the loss of freedom and flexibility with no apparent benefit.

without the sanitation this should be... bq. $adapterName = $adapterNamespace . '\_' . $adapter;
