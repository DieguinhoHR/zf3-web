### Description

Even though the default way to measure angles is radians, some people (like me) still think in degrees. Therefore, I think it would save many people a few minutes (or, in rare cases, hours) of frustration if we mention this in the doco. I did a complete scan of the source in trunk (1.10.2) and only found three methods that take angles as parameters and they are all in Zend\_Pdf\_Page.

This is my first attempt at contributing a patch to the ZF project (or, indeed, any open source project), so please be nice if I've screwed something up on the Jira ticket. Thanks. :-)
