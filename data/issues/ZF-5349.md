ZF-5349: Pass null value to setItemCountPerPage()

### Description

I wanted to give the user the ability to return all rows from the DB on the same page, so in a user interface you can select 'All' which then sends a 0 to setItemCountPerPage()

This produces a warning of divide by 0 when it runs \_calculatePageCount internally, therefore we should probably test to see if \_itemCountPerPage is 0 or null first, and return a 0 if it is? Something like :

 
    <pre class="literal">
       /**
         * Calculate the page count
         *
         * @return integer
         */
       protected function _calculatePageCount()
       {
            if ( $this->_itemCountPerPage > 0 )
                return (integer) ceil($this->_adapter->count() / $this->_itemCountPerPage);
            return 0;
       }

Use the All ScrollingStyle

Actual code is :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setItemCountPerPage($itemCountPerPage)
        {
            $this->_itemCountPerPage = (integer) $itemCountPerPage;
            if ($this->_itemCountPerPage == 0) {
                $this->_itemCountPerPage = 1;
            }
            $this->_pageCount        = $this->_calculatePageCount();
    // ... ... ...


If 0 is set, \_itemCountPerPage is set to 1, so there cant be division by zero.

Have you got a use case ?

Ah sorry my bad, we still might need to change something though. Found out that I was passing a null value to setItemCountPerPage() which made it throw the warnings regarding the divide by 0 error. Might want to add code in to protect against that.

It might depend on your ZF version. We had such a bug some versions ago (dont remember), but it has been resolved. Read the SVN log. (Casting null to int gives 0, which is then converted to 1 in the actual code)
