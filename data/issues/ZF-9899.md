### Description

When running a controller unit test (using the $this->dispatch('/') for example), a call to $this->getRequest()->getHttpHost() in a controller returns the colon sign - ":".

To replicate:

Create the following action in a controller:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        public function colonAction() {
            $this->_helper->layout()->disableLayout();
            $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender();
            $this->getResponse()->setBody($this->getRequest()->getHttpHost());
        }


If you'll go over to that action in a browser, you'll get the appropriate host name.

Now write a test with the following method:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        public function test_colonAction() {
            $this->dispatch('/index/colon');
            self::assertEquals(':', $this->getResponse()->getBody());
        }


Running the test will result in a successful run (which means the getHttpHost method returns a : sign when run in a test).

Although this result is expected as the tests are run from CLI, it is good to clean up the output of this method.

I have attached a patch file which does this, with the associated unit test.

Elaboration on my patch fix: The reason i have chosen to test against SERVER\_NAME, instead of php\_sapi\_name() is that other tests simulating an HTTP request would fail.
