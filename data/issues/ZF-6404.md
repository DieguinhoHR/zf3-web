### Description

Currently (version 1.8) it's impossible to use _assemble_ when using route Chain without side-effects. Chain's assemble method checks what variables each chain node injected into assembled url:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function assemble($data = array(), $reset = false, $encode = false)
        {
            $value = '';
    
            foreach ($this->_routes as $key => $route) {
                if ($key > 0) {
                    $value .= $this->_separators[$key];
                }
    
                $value .= $route->assemble($data, $reset, $encode);
    // Check begins here vvvvv
                if (method_exists($route, 'getVariables')) {
                    $variables = $route->getVariables();
    
                    foreach ($variables as $variable) {
                        $data[$variable] = null;
                    }
                }
            }
    
            return $value;
        }


Note for getVariables method. Everything seemed to be great for now BUT only _Hostname_ route seemed to implement this method so when we trying to chain few Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route objects together with last of them having '\*' in pattern, or chaining Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route with Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Module we have all of our params wich was already in url from first Route elements doubled by the last one:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $lngRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
                ':language',
                array(
                    'language'      =>  'none',
                ),
                array(
                    'language'      =>  '[a-z]{2}'
                )
            );
    // App_Controller_Router_Route_Module -- workaroud to ZF-6399
            $route_module = new App_Controller_Router_Route_Module(
                array(),
                $dispatcher,
                $request
            );
    
            $chain = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Chain();
            $chain->chain($lngRoute);
            $chain->chain($route_module);
            $router->addRoute('default', $chain);
    
    
    ...........
    
            $router->assemble(array('language' => 'en', 'module' => 'user', 'controller' => 'register', 'action' => 'action'));
    // EXPECTED: /en/user/register/action
    // CURRENT OUTPUT: /en/user/register/action/language/en


That happens because Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route DO NOT define getVariables method.

so it seemed to me that all Rute\_\* classes should be reworked with getVariables method added (more of it: it would be great to add this method to Abstract Route class).
