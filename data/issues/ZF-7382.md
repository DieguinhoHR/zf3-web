ZF-7382: Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl doesn't detect Transfer-Encoding: chunked properly

### Description

The HTTP/1.1 Spec states that messages header field values may be preceded by any amount of LWS ( [http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2) ). The Curl adapter checks if a message is chunked by doing a string position check for "Transfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n", which will not detect valid headers with excess whitespace like "Transfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n". If this check succeeds, it removes the header as Curl automatically handles chunked messages.

This results in the Zend\_Http\_Response trying to decode the message as if it were chunked and throwing an error that the message doesn't appear to be chunked.
