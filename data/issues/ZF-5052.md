This looks like a new feature. New features must wait for minor releases. Mickael, could you also include the issue tracker ID in your commits. This will link it back to the issue tracker to make it much easier for us to see what was actually committed. Refer to Matthew's commits to see exact format.

I didn't implement getIsConnected but isConnected. After commiting to resolve ZF-5050, I saw this issue and marked it as resolved with SVN revision.
