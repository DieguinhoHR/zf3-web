ZF-2242: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form\* should use view scripts instead of PHP generated HTML

### Description

Right now the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form\* all generate HTML from the PHP classes.

I think it would be a lot nicer if it would use a view to do this for the whole MVC structure. HTML should never be generated but read and modified instead.

Zend Framework does not ship with view scripts, nor will it; view scripts are a matter of preference, and due to the fact that they are resolved at runtime based on user configuration, this would be a nightmare to maintain, and in most cases would not provide an out-of-the-box form solution for most ZF users. There is, however, no reason you cannot create a decorator that renders view scripts instead (ZF-2654 proposes just such a decorator for use with Zend\_Form, btw).

Furthermore, one primary purpose for view helpers is to take repetitive tasks or tasks requiring substantial logic and wrap them in a method that returns _content_. That last part is particularly important as view helpers are _expected_ to return content; they are a part of the _view_ layer, after all. Form elements fall into both of these categories, and are thus a perfect fit for view helpers.
