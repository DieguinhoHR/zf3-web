ZF-9542: Exception when Provider Method Variables Start with Same Letter, Causes Short Flag Collision
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-25T21:28:37.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-28T20:59:55.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Tool will use the variable names in the method signature of a providers methods to figure out the long and short flags for the methods command line options. For instance, the long and short flags of the command line options for this method would be one, o, two, t, and four, f.

public function count($one, $two, $four)

The short flag is just the first letter of the long flag, and is extracted on line 172 of Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/Manifest.php. This causes an issue with Zend\_Console\_Getopt if two parameters start with the same letter. An exception is thrown in Zend/Console/Getopt in \_addRulesModeZend, when the flags are being processed around line 930. If the method's signature was instead:

public function count($one, $two, $three)

the exception "Option -t is being defined more than once" would be thrown by Zend\_Console\_Getopt.

This could be handled in Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console\_Manifest by having it check for short flag duplication. I made a modified Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/Manifest.php which I'll upload when this is created. The relevant changes are in a foreach loop between lines 157 and 230, mostly between 165 and 204.

Also, if for some reason this "is not a bug" because of a standard practice I'm not aware of, please make it very explicit in the docs that you shouldn't use variable names that start with the same letter.

With corrections between lines 157 and 204 to virtually eliminate possibility of short flag collision.

Can you create a patch against 1.11 and attach it?
