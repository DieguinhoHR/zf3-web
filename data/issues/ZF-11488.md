ZF-11488: Zend\_Locale\_Math::round() incorrect result
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once "Zend/Locale/Math.php";
    var_dump(round(1, 5)); //returns: float(1)
    var_dump(Zend_Locale_Math::round(1, 5)); //returns: string(3) "1.0"


I would have expected that both will return 1

This is no failure

Zend\_Locale\_Math does not return float values and it does not work 100% like php's round which shows some errorous behaviour with special values

Zend\_Locale\_Math is an internal method which does pre-work for Zend\_Locale. It uses string values to prevent php from stripping values, or converting them automatically and unintentionally

As long as there is no failure by calculation with Zend\_Locale\_Format or other classes using it things should not change to prevent localization problems
