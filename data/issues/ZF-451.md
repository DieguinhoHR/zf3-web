ZF-451: Zend\_Cache::File/SQLite - Inconsistent performance
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I've tested the File and SQLite backends of Zend\_Cache and found the performance to be a bit inconsistent. Using Cache\_Lite, one of my pages loads anywhere from 0.45-0.57 secs but with Zend\_Cache, the range is anywhere from 0.63-1.27 secs (2x variance) - both configured with a lifetime of 1 hour, serialization true and cleaning-factor 0 on 2 GHz Core Duo/1 GB RAM. The above figures are with template force-compilation on. However, without force-compilation, the figures are:

Cache\_Lite: 0.11-0.17 secs Zend\_Cache: 0.16-0.35 secs (still at over 2x variance)

Is there anything we can do about improving on the variance?

I don't think there is something to do againt that. Zend\_Cache is a bigger thing than Cache\_Lite (because of backends support...).

Probably you should try an opcode cache (like APC).

And have a look at this mail :

if you are interested in high performances with Zend\_Cache
