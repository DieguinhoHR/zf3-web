ZF-5673: Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain misinformation

### Description

In the documentation when talking about chaining routes it states:

"Parameter priority

When chaining routes like the hostname route and the path route together, the parameters of the hostname route have a higher priority than the parameters of the path route. Thus if you define a controller in the hostname and in the path route, the controller of the hostname route will be selected."

However, it would infact be the controller of the path route would be selected.

Personally I feel it should be as stated in the documentation, so I'm not sure whether this is a documentation error or a code bug.
