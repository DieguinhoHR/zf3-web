---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If 'conditional' param is set for HeadStyle view helper, it produces HTML code with nested comments. Document with nested comments doesn't validate on W3C Markup Validator (<http://validator.w3.org/>).

Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$styles '...';
    $this->headStyle()->appendStyle($styles, array('conditional' => 'lt IE 7');

Produces:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


This code doesn't validates.

 

 

### Comments

The whole point of conditional stylesheet support is to create exactly these comments -- which are used by IE to determine which stylesheet to utilize. Removing the comments would break the functionality. If you don't want the comments, don't pass a value to the conditional stylesheets parameter.

I understand point of conditional stylesheet support. I think that the problem is that content of style is enclosed by " " tag. It isn't defined neither in XHTML 1.0 nor HTML 4.01 specs. I think that the best way to resolve this issue is to delete comment for HTML content and add CDATA tag for XHTML.

Current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">        $html = '';

Could be changed to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // XHTML or HTML?
            $commentTagStart = '';
            $commentTagEnd = '';
            if (($this->view instanceof Zend_View_Abstract) && !$this->view->doctype()->isXhtml()) {
                $commentTagStart= '';
                $commentTagEnd= '';
            }
    
            $html = '';

Now, by default, framework produces invalid code. I think it lowers quality of framework.

The problem is that in HTML 4, IE will not see the conditional if there is no comment. This has nothing to do with whether or not the markup is valid, but everything to do with supporting broken browsers. If you need that kind of support, valid HTML is a secondary concern.

(BTW, in the XHTML variant, CDATA _is_ used -- it's just in vanilla HTML markup that comments are used.)

Thanks for explanation. Didn't know about this IE bug.
