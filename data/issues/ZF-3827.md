### Description

Currently, there is no manual documentation on how to create custom routes to use with the Rewrite router, and the API docs are incomplete. Both need to be resolved.

I'm currently working on a custom route class, so I should at least be able to contribute a patch for the API docs for Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface.

Two things:

1. Implementing setRoute() in your custom route is meaningless if you don't manually create and pass in a request, as otherwise the front controller doesn't create the route until dispatch.
2. It should be noted that you must copy in the getInstance() method, since it returns new self().

At the very least these two notes should save some frustration on the part of others.
