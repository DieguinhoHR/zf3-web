### Description

I put this code in Boostrap.php :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _initLogger(){
            $logger = new Zend_Log();
            $writer = new Zend_Log_Writer_Stream("php://stderr");
            $logger->addWriter($writer);
            Zend_Registry::set('logger', $logger);
            $logger->log("Logger created", Zend_Log::ERR);
        }// _initLogger


It logs into global Apache log file instead of logging to virtual host log file. trigger\_error logs in the virtual host file as it is supposed to do.

I think it is a bug. Sorry if it is not.

My bet is that this is a PHP bug (and/or intended feature). Have you tried writing to <a>php://stderr</a> directly? I suspect that it behaves differently than trigger\_error().

If you can confirm that it behaves differently (i.e., writing to <a>php://stderr</a> and trigger\_error write to different locations when directly invoked), you should log your issue upstream to the PHP project. If it does not -- i.e., if writing to <a>php://stderr</a> directly actually writes to your vhost's error log like trigger\_error does -- then and only then would I consider this a ZF issue.

You are absolutely right ! This is a php issue. I made the test and <a>php://stderr</a> writes to apache global log file. Minus one bug for you...plus one for them :)
