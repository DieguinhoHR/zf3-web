### Description

When you look at Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract, it does things like this in the \_connect() method :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!extension_loaded('pdo')) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Db_Adapter_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Adapter_Exception('The PDO extension is required for this adapter but the extension is not loaded');
            }


However, when you look at the setFetchMode() method, it uses the PDO class without checking for the PDO extention presence which can lead to a "PDO class not found" bug. So I suggest to add a check for the PDO extension in that method too (no more methods need that)
