### Description

I have some construction like this:

$\_paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($query); $\_paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page); $items = $\_paginator->setItemCountPerPage($perPage);

foreach ($items as &$item) { $item['some\_key'] = 'some value' }

Until revision 11970 - this works fine After revision 11970 - throw an exception:: "An iterator cannot be used with foreach by reference"

That error appears since PHP 5.2. It's not a ZF problem, I think it's a PHP version problem. Anyway, since PHP5.2 : An iterator cannot be used with foreach by reference

Endi, could you discuss your use case here?

Postponing this issue, since it appears to be a PHP problem instead of a Paginator problem. Please update this issue if this actually is a Paginator issue .

As this issue hasn't been updated in six months and it's reported to be a PHP change, I'm closing it.
