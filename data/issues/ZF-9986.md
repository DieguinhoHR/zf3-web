ZF-9986: MultiCheckbox case conversion
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-06-14T21:32:50.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-06-17T11:53:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement( 'multiCheckbox', 'myField', array( 'label' => 'Whatever', array( 'a', 'b', 'c' ));


throws an exception on a case sensitive file system because it cannot find the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multicheckbox: because the file is named MultiCheckbox not Multicheckbox (upper case C). Works fine on a case insensitive file system. I rooted through the code for a bit trying to find where the element type was lowercased but could not see it: only a ucfirst() call in the plugin loader...

Temporary workaround is to rename Form/Element/MultiCheckbox.php to Form/Element/Multicheckbox.php. Having upper or lower case C in the addElement() call seems to make no difference.

(related to bug ZF-5368, ZF-7047)

oops. sorry, my bad. i made an error synchronising my code to the file server (the ftp client didn't pick up the change from 'c' to 'C')

Can't see how to cancel / delete this bug report. Sorry for the inconvenience (but if its any consolation I just wasted a couple of hours trying to figure out looking for a non existent bug in the ZF code that was working perfectly...)

Not an issue as stated by the opener.
