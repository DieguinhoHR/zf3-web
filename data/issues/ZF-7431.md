### Description

I have reported this issue to Juokaz but his fix (if any) didn't make it into 1.9.0

As [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/…](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc296193%28SQL.90%29.aspx) states, certain SQL types will be converted to native PHP objects. For example, the datetime SQL time comes back as a PHP DateTime object (<http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php>) rather than a string.

I believe that these columns should be fetched as strings, allowing you to switch between the sqlsrv and other (e.g. pdo\_mssql) adapters without introducing additional logic to handle string/Datetime data types in your application.

The PHP data type used to represent a column can be specified using sqlsrv\_get\_field. See [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/…](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc296208%28SQL.90%29.aspx)

I have few sollutions in mind, but only one work for me: having Date object cast to sting. Its quite easy in all calls to check if returned value is date object and then return value as a string representation. I don't think that using sqlsrv\_get\_field for all fields is a good idea. Basically you will end-up with exponentially increasing load.

I agree Juozas, I think this is the most efficient way to handle the problem. The overhead in building a string from the DateTime should be minimal.

Many thanks

It might be worth noting that with the very recent Sqlsrv 1.1 CTP there is now an option to return all datetime values as strings, which you can pass into the driver\_options of your DB config

Excellent. I wonder if this option should be enabled by default, so this adapter functions as per other Zend\_Db\_Adapters?

In testing the 1.1 version, I was required to update my SQL Server Native Client component. The link given in the exception was wrong (outdated), however and I found the latest version at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/…](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123717&clcid=0x409) via [http://microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx/…](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c6c3e9ef-ba29-4a43-8d69-a2bed18fe73c)

This has been fixed at the driver level by Microsoft in later versions of their sqlsrv driver. It is sugguested you upgrade to 1.1 of the sql server driver.
