### Description

I think that Zend\_Db\_Profiler should get some mechanisms to be added a Zend\_Log component that could just log its work.

Some kind of $profiler->setLog(Zend\_Log $log); $profiler->enableLog() $profiler->disableLog();

the $log element could then create its own Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_Dbprofiler(), to choose what infos to log.

What do you think about that ?
