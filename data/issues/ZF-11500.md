### Description

I have discovered that within

/release-1.10/library/Zend/Service/Twitter|Search.php [line 120]

trends calls the url , <http://search.twitter.com> which has expired. if i reset the url to

$this->setUri("https://api.twitter.com/1");

it works again.

guessing that this needs updating ?
