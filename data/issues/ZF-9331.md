### Description

I recently found myself needing to use Zend\_Log to create entries with a UTC timestamp (using gmdate()). However, in order to do this with the existing Zend\_Log I have to override the _entire_ 50 line Zend\_Log::log() method, which makes my subclass very brittle.

I propose moving the event creation to a method like so:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $event = $this->_packEvent($message, $priority);
    // ...
    protected function _packEvent($message, $priority)
    {
        return array_merge(array(
            'timestamp' => date('c'),
            'message' => $message,
            'priority' => $priority,
            'priorityName' => $this->_priorities[$priority]),
            $this->_extras
        );
    }


This will not cause any BC breaks, and is harmless.
