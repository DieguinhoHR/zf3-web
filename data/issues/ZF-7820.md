### Description

i want redefine some functions in this class to improve it for my project, but i need make small but not simple changes, so make partials or write absolutely new class haven't any sense. TO problem.. I wrote this code and created new model:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class MenuRenderer extends Zend_View_Helper_Navigation_Menu
    {
    
    }


and in view script:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $mr=new MenuRenderer;
        echo $mr->render($this->lm);


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Call to a member function escape() on a non-object in D:\Apache\htdocs\libs\Zend\View\Helper\HtmlElement.php on line 92


- - - - - -


    <pre class="highlight">
        $mr=new MenuRenderer;
        $mr->setview($this);
        echo $mr->render($this->lm);


work's fine

A quick side note, If you had used your view helper as view helpers are intended to be used, you would not have this problem of needing to call $mc->setView($this);

You should really add a helper path to include a path to your helper which would allow the helper to be loaded automatically, rather than making an instance of it directly in your view.
