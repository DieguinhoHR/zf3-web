When using Zend\_Dom\_Query::query with a query of the form '#\_\_' it doesn't convert it to the correct Xpath query.

Have the same problem. The fix would be in Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2Xpath::\_tokenize():

Change $expression = preg\_replace('|#([a-z][a-z0-9\_-]_)|i', '[@id=\\'$1\\']', $expression); to $expression = preg\_replace('|#([a-z\_][a-z0-9\_-]_)|i', '[@id=\\'$1\\']', $expression);
