### Description

Once unit testing for each file of the component reaches 80% LOC coverage and there exists satisfactory DocBook documentation for the APIs, the Zend\_Validate\_Barcode component needs to be promoted to core (i.e., moved to trunk with unit tests and documentation integrated).

Andries, what is the status of Zend\_Validate\_Barcode? Should it be included in the preview release?

Wil, everything besides DocBook documentation is done.

Documentation is done, ready to promote to core.

We should have some deterministic method to arrive on constant values used in the Zend\_Validate\_\* classes. See [ZF-2397] for more information. I'm not sure which approach would be best, but we should pick something. For the short term, I suggest the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Validate_Barcode_UpcA::INVALID = 'invalid';
    Zend_Validate_Barcode_UpcA::INVALID_LENGTH = 'invalidLength';
    (and similarly for Zend_Validate_Barcode_Ean13)


The questions in my mind are whether or not to "mirror" the constant names with the values, and whether or not to include "namespaces", such as in the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Validate_Barcode_UpcA::INVALID = 'Zend_Validate_Barcode_UpcA::INVALID';

I resolved this in r8210

Fixed for next minor release with [SVN r8211](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=8211).
