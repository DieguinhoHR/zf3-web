### Description

The ArrayOfTypeSequence WSDL strategy can only add arrays of _basic xsd types_ like int, string, etc. Currently it is not possible to use it with _singular complex types_ or _arrays of complex types_.

I know there is also an ArrayOfTypeComplex strategy, but it uses soap-enc:Array arrays while ArrayOfTypeSequence uses a sequence containing an _unbounded element_. The latter is WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 compliant, the former isn't but still commonly used, so it makes sense to have both. Additionally, ArrayOfTypeSequence supports _multi-dimensional_ arrays (like MyComplexType[][]) while ArrayOfTypeComplex doesn't.

The _patch_ attached to this issue adds support for complex types in ArrayOfTypeSequence the same way ArrayOfTypeComplex does: by extending the DefaultComplexType strategy and calling parent::addComplexType($type) when appropriate.

Now, I'm not sure this patch is the best way to do things... Ideally I think there should be 2 kinds of strategies in Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl: one for singular complex types, and one for arrays. But as it is, this patch is the easiest solution and it imitates what already exists in ArrayOfTypeComplex. Comments are welcome :)

I really appreciate that this patch was added. It has been working great for acheiving WS-I compliance. Things work great when defining arrays of simpleTypes and complexTypes, such as:

@param string[] @param Zend\_SomeMadeUpClass[]

However, for double nested arrays to work, a patch must be made, such as:

@param string[][] @param Zend\_SomeMadeUpClass[][]

The problem is that each array creates a complex type of 'ArrayofString' or 'ArrayofZend\_SomeMadeUpClass' with the appropriate 'xsd:string' or 'tns:Zend\_SomeMadeUpClass' type, but when complex types of those complex types are made, the setAttribute('type', $childTypeName); on line 136 does not prepend 'tns:' for 'ArrayofString' or 'ArrayofZend\_SomeMadeUpClass'.

Basically, I made it so the function prepends 'tns:' when child exists in the context type list.

 
    protected function _addElementFromWsdlAndChildTypes($arrayType, $childTypeName)
    {
        if (!in_array($arrayType, $this->getContext()->getTypes())) {
            // IF STATEMENT ADDED FOR PATCH
            if (in_array($childTypeName, $this->getContext()->getTypes())) {
                $childTypeName = 'tns:' . $childTypeName;
            }
    
            $dom = $this->getContext()->toDomDocument();

I also want to add that this makes it possible to do as many array nestings as you like.

I ran tests through SoapUI with tenth level nested arrays of complextypes (because who doesn't want that).

Oh you're right, I hadn't taken that case into account - thanks for testing!

Here is an updated version of my patch with a different fix.

Given that \_getTypeNameBasedOnNestingLevel() returns a prefixed type when it's singular, I thought it would be better to make its behavior consistent and return a prefixed ArrayOf type (with "tns:").

In consequence, I added a substr() to remove any prefix from $complexTypeName in addComplexType() (line 40). This way, \_addElementFromWsdlAndChildTypes() is always given the correct parameters without having to check/modify them.

Great work Fabien. All testing on my end works like a charm with your patch.

I applied the patch to trunk, it should be included in version 1.9
