### Description

Hi,

i have found out that at least the IE 7 has a Problem when two inputs have the same value for id and name like

, because when trying to get the checkbox in javascript by getElementById always the hidden field is returned. This can be solved by changing the outputorder of the both fields:

The affected class is Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox:

The code need to be changed like this:

// build the element $xhtml = '';

 
        $xhtml .= '<input type="checkbox"'
                . ' name="' . $this->view->escape($name) . '"'
                . ' id="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"'
                . ' value="' . $this->view->escape($checkedValue) . '"'
                . $checked
                . $disabled
                . $this->_htmlAttribs($attribs)
                . $endTag;
        if (!strstr($name, '[]')) {
            $xhtml.= $this->_hidden($name, $unCheckedValue);
        }


Regards,

Marcus

The problem with switching the output order is that the primary behavior we are trying to allow -- submission of an "unchecked" value when the checkbox is not checked -- will now not work correctly. When the form is submitted, the value of the last element with the given name will be returned -- in the case of your change, the unchecked value would always be returned.

Well, thats a fact i can't erase. So i think we/i have to find a workaround for the IE... Item closed (from my point of view).

I'm surprised that IE is using the name when you try to select by ID -- that's really, really broken behavior (the hidden element does not have an ID, if you look closely).

Have you tried using jquery, dojo.query, etc for selecting nodes in IE? do you get the same issue?

I know. That was the first thing i was wondering about. But when i used the Microsoft Script Debugger i saw it black on white. After i fetched the Element by ID my javascript variable keeped the hidden-field object. I couldn't believed it myself. After i made the code change i mentioned above everything worked fine in all browsers.

We use the YUI framework. First i used the Dom.get-Method and i thought this would be the problem, but then i got the same results by using document.getElementById(); The scripts were still referenced, maybe thats an issue? I will try to remove them and look what will happen.

I have created a very simple testside for checking if tis misbehaviour comes from our used framework or not.

The error happens not, because we use the framework. It seems that it is in fact an IE bug. Here is my simple form:

 Checkbox When executing this Firefox outputs "checkbox", IE 7 means "hidden".

If this is infact an IE bug can we close this issue so it's not open?

Yes, it can be closed.
