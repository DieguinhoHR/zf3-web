### Description

In some cases Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket fails to correctly read chunked answer from server. I figured out this on one server with PHP 5.2.5 (as I can remember). The problem was with strlen function - it returns not actual bytes in string and makes problem with reading chunk. I suggest to use ftell function instead of relying on strlen.

Here is my patch for Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Socket.php (Zend Framework 1.7.8).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    265,267c265,267
    <                     $left_to_read = $chunksize;
    <                     while ($left_to_read > 0) {
    <                         $line = @fread($this->socket, $left_to_read);
    ---
    >                     $read_to = ftell($this->socket) + $chunksize;
    >                     while ($read_to > ftell($this->socket)) {
    >                         $line = @fread($this->socket, $read_to - ftell($this->socket));
    273d272
    <                             $left_to_read -= strlen($line);


P.S. I know that PHP is binary safe but I can't explain error with strlen function (or fread?) on that server (it's not mine and with suhosin patch), but this patch works for me fine.

This is because mbstring.func\_overload is in use, and the website contains multibyte characters. I cannot use Zend\_Http\_Client against any Chinese website, eg. <www.google.cn>.

Working on another patch...

Hmm needs a fix in ->getBody() of the response object too...

Patch to fix chunked encoding

To be more accurate, this happens when: - mbstring is loaded - mbstring.func\_overload & 2 - mbstring.internal\_encoding is a multibyte-encoding

This is pretty hard to reproduce for those who don't have that setup - but I've added some unit tests that catch this (given the right php.ini configuration) and will look into solving this. This is actually a bigger problem, and affects several other places in Zend\_Http and Zend\_Uri. It was solved for Zend\_OpenId by implementing a dedicated strlen() wrapper (see Zend\_OpenId::strlen())

Resolved in rev. 17041 along with another related issue in Http\_Client.

BTW thanks for the ftell() idea - that worked well although I reduced the number of calls. I used mb\_internal\_encoding everywhere else, just to avoid the consecutive if() calls.
