### Description

- -_PHP Config processing_- \*\* -_Should we use specific keys to do ini\_set at zf.php startup time_- \*\*\* -_include\_path_- \*\*\* -_error\_settings, etc (downside is that we can only change runtime values)_-
- _Zend\_Tool Configuration_ \*\* _Local storage will be inside $ZF\_HOME_ \*\*\* -_$ZF\_HOME known as $HOME/.zf/ (unless env var says otherwise)_- \*\*\*\* -_should we support both $HOME/zf.ini and $ZF\_HOME/zf.ini ?_- \*\*\* -$client->getConfig()->getRealPath('profiles/default.xml') would return the full path to $ZF\_HOME/profiles/default.xml if it exists or false-
- -_zf.php_- \*\* -_Will process the ini first as parse\_ini()_- \*\*\* -_this will allow us to extract php settings_- \*\*\* -_Will be processed a second time when Zend\_Tool\_Client\_Configuration (or \_Options) has a chance to get the file and run. This will use Zend\_Config and will be Zend\_Config writable_-
- Provider changes \*\* any delete() actions will check to see if a force option is set in ini, if so then it will not ask if its ok to delete something \*\* -Provider will check the directory for profiles/default.xml- \*\* -Provider will support --profile-name $name, where $name is profiles/$name.xml- \*\* Module Provider will check directory for profiles/modules.xml before attempting to clone the application node.
- Context changes \*\* search for known key for content on specific context actions \*\*\* create(), for example, should look for context.htaccess.create.content OR context.htaccess.create.codeGenerator \*\*\*\* key would be a path to a file that has either a codeGenerator script (user would have to know to use the provied $codeGenerator object, and know its type) \*\*\* other actions should always look for a codeGenerator
- _Setup Script_ \*\* _Should only live in svn_ \*\* _Its purpose:_ \*\*\* _setup (interactively) $ZF\_HOME_ \*\*\* copy the default.xml & module.xml profiles \*\*\* _create the stock zf.ini file_ \*\*\* _interactively get values and confirm values_ \*\*\*\* include\_path \*\*\*\* loaders \*\*\*\* Zend Framework path
- Zend\_Tool new Loader \*\* There will be a new loader introduced, it will take paths and recurse them. \*\* Functionality will be pulled from includPathLoader, and IncludePathLoader will extend this loader. (Or a base loader will be used) \*\* Loader will check for config values: \*\*\* client.loader.paths[]
