### Description

Attempting construct a Zend\_Uri in an interactive PHP console fails with an "unsupported operand type" error:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $ php -a
    Interactive shell
    
    php > require_once('Zend/Uri.php');
    php > Zend_Uri::factory("http://<a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>");
    PHP Fatal error:  Unsupported operand types in .../library/Zend/Validate/Hostname.php on line 469
    PHP Stack trace:
    PHP   1. {main}() php shell code:0
    PHP   2. Zend_Uri::factory() php shell code:1
    PHP   3. Zend_Uri_Http->__construct() .../library/Zend/Uri.php:130
    PHP   4. Zend_Uri_Http->valid() .../library/Zend/Uri/Http.php:154
    PHP   5. Zend_Uri_Http->validateHost() .../library/Zend/Uri/Http.php:281
    PHP   6. Zend_Validate_Hostname->isValid() .../library/Zend/Uri/Http.php:449


Oddly enough, this works just fine when executed inside of a .php file.

Digging through past versions, it seems this behavior didn't start until ZF 1.8.0.

What version of php are you on (in CLI mode)?

This is interesting:

I've looked into the source code and this error is in my understanding impossible :-)

Checked against trunk... lines are +1 Line 470 (old 469):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                                $regexChars += $this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)];


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    *1*                    $this->_tld = strtolower($matches[1]);
                        if ($this->_validateTld) {
                            if (!in_array($this->_tld, $this->_validTlds)) {
                                $this->_error(self::UNKNOWN_TLD);
                                $status = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
    
                        /**
                         * Match against IDN hostnames
                         * Note: Keep label regex short to avoid issues with long patterns when matching IDN hostnames
                         * @see Zend_Validate_Hostname_Interface
                         */
    *2*                    $regexChars = array(0 => '/^[a-z0-9\x2d]{1,63}$/i');
                        if ($this->_validateIdn &&  isset($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)])) {
                            if (is_string($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)])) {
                                $regexChars += include($this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)]);
                            } else {
    *0*                            $regexChars += $this->_validIdns[strtoupper($this->_tld)];
                            }
                        }


_1_: $this->\_tld is in any case a string by using strtolower($matches[1]); Else the error/warning/notice would have been thrown in this line. So the problem is not regarding the usage of strtoupper($this->\_tld) within \*0\*

_0_: $this->\_validatldns is an internal array which is set in any case. So the problem can not be due to \_validldsn not being an array.

_2_: $regexChars is in any case an array which is set. So the problem can not be the usage of += as the array is already set.

In sum: I don't see a way how a fatal error can occur within ZF1.8 / trunk.

Can you do some debugging to see where the problem comes from ?

 

 

Posted by Trevor Johns (tjohns) on 2009-06-24T17:34:24.000+0000

So, I did some more digging, and I found the problem.

It seems that when running from the interactive shell, include() is always returning int(1). As a result, we're executing:

$regexChars += 1;

I've verified this behavior on several systems, as well as the latest release of PHP (5.2.10).

I'm attributing this to a problem with PHP itself. It looks like there's a bug open for this behavior in the PHP bug tracker, but it was marked as bogus (working as intended). I'm not sure why.

Since PHP Bug #48056 is closed and I can't add any comments to it, I've opened a new bug asking somebody to look into this:

<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48682>

Closing as not reproducable.

Feel free to reopen it as soon as you can provide us with a way how to prevent include from returning a 1 instead of the file itself in your case.

I'm seeing the same issues on 1.9.0, 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 when trying to utilize Zend\_Http\_Client but the errors being reported appear exactly the same and testing Zend\_Uri as the original reporter did produces the same result for me.

Discovered this is a general fallacy with PHP's include function that appears to have gone awry in 5.2.9 and 5.2.10 and possibly other version. Reported as bug there.

I see no way how ZF can solve a problem which is related to special PHP versions. Specially when we don't know how this occurs nor how we could fix it.

 

 

Posted by Trevor Johns (tjohns) on 2009-08-31T11:41:23.000+0000

Thomas is correct.

This is definitely a PHP bug, not a ZF one. Nothing further to do here.
