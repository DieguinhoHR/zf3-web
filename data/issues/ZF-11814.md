ZF-11814: Remember meta info (link file name and line number) per config option
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I have problems with a navigation.ini file throwing errors, but it is not possible to go from the config option back to the line of the ini file that caused the error:

[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11805?focusedCommentId=48662&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-48662)

Could this info be saved as part of the option?

Hello monk e boy, you never get the line number with the error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    cms.paes.ntro.lael      = Edit
    cms.pags.intr.moule     = admin
    cm.pages.into.controler = cms
    cms.paes.intro.ation    = editor


This is a correct file, because there is no error in the ini syntax! Zend\_Config (parse\_ini\_file) works without problems.

Only if the ini syntax is wrong, then you get an error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    cms.pages.intro.label = Edit
    
    !


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Config_Exception' with message 'syntax error, unexpected '!' in foo.ini on line 3


So you can see, there is no chance to get a line number, if no syntax error is present.

From the example on: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.adapters.ini.html)

Why can't I do:

$config = new Zend\_Config\_Ini('/path/to/config.ini', 'staging');  
 echo $config->database->params->host; // prints "dev.example.com" echo $config->database->params->dbname; // prints "dbname" // PROPOSED CHANGES: echo $config->database->params->host->meta; // prints "/path/to/config.ini, line 44"

Then this could be used to fix the other bug linked in my first comment.

Sorry, I should have mentioned that Zend\_Config\_Ini would have to save this info somewhere (or calculate it when it's needed)

{quote}

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Prints the error message:


Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in /…/foo.php on line 9 ```

// PROPOSED CHANGES: echo $config->database->params->host->meta; // prints "/path/to/config.ini, line 44"

Look, it's not rocket science. Just store the file name and line number with each item in the Config. I propose the attribute in the config item is called 'meta' but feel free to call it what you like.

As an optimisation you could normalize the data a bit.

The current operation of Zend\_Config is that $config->b doesn't generate any errors if b doesn't exit. (though $config->a->b will do as Frank notes). Any change to this behaviour has to be added as a configurable option as we cannot break B/C on ZF 1.

If we are going to generate an error message on property not found, then it should be an Exception, not an echoed message.

If you have signed the CLA, please provide a patch that meets these criteria.
