### Description

By default there is iso-8859-1 encoding at the constructor. And there is no way to change it except create another class and inherit it from Mail class and set encoding at the new class. So I believe the 'utf-8' encoding must be there by default. it's very simple to fix.

It would break BC either. I fixed it in ZF2 though.
