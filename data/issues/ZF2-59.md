ZF2-59: Bad default path for CLDR resources in CLDR adapter
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Some tests fail because there is a regression from the new location of CLDR data in the tree framework (ie. /resources/cldr instead of /library/Zend/Locale/Data). The default path of CLDR Data is not used in \_findRoute method: the \_path attribute has default value at null. It should be used the getPath method to initialize the default path.

{color:red}Actual:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filename = __DIR__ . '/' . self::$_path . $locale . '.xml'; // line 149


{color}

{color:green}Expected:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filename = self::getPath() . '/' . $locale . '.xml'; // line 149


{color}

Closing as non-issue

Please note that Zend\_Locale 2.0 is still in development.

The mentioned method from the old implementation is only a placeholder which will be erased as soon as the new implementation has been finished. There is no benefit in fixing a method which will be erased soon.

Sanitize master in progress.
