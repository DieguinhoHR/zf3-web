ZF-8613: Add HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST support to Zend\_View\_Helper\_ServerUrl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-12-22T07:10:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:34.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Servers that are behind any type of proxy (i.e., mod\_proxy or nginx) would incorrectly get the proxy server's host address when using the serverUrl view helper. The attached patch adds support for serverUrl to look for the HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST property in the server super global, and if present, use its value instead of HTTP\_HOST.
