ZF-3770: Zend\_Uri setters do not return Zend\_Uri object
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-07-26T20:28:07.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:35.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The setter methods of Zend\_Uri currently return string values, not Zend\_Uri, which is undesirable and inconsistent within the framework. The setter methods of an object should return the object on which the setter was called, permitting additional method chaining. Zend\_Uri returns the value overwritten by the current set operation.

While I agree with this change, it would break backwards compatibility so it might not be wise to do before ZF-2.0 (in which I suggest a full rewrite of Zend\_Uri).

It would be interesting to note if anyone is actually using the current functionality of the class, and I'd love to hear the use case for it. I don't necessarily agree that a complete rewrite of the class is necessary (most of the logged issues seem to revolve around improving the regex validation), even if the return values are altered in a minor version. Maybe I'll take it up as a proposal on the wiki...
