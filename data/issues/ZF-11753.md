### Description

when setting the segment explicitly to 'content' nothing ends up in layout()->content. There is no obvious reason setting the segment to 'content' shouldn't work.

Can you please provide a simple case which reproduces your error?

In default layout file:

echo $this->layout()->content;

In controller action:

$this->\_helper->viewRenderer->setResponseSegment('content');

In view file:

echo 'CONTENT'

The output is empty.

====

When changing 'content' to anything but 'content' works fine. So in default layout file:

echo $this->layout()->content2;

In controller action:

$this->\_helper->viewRenderer->setResponseSegment('content2');
