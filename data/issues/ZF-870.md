### Description

I think it can usefull to test if a transaction already started and not commited or rolled back.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function update() {
        $db = WebD::Db::getInstance();
        $db->beginTransaction();
        try {
            $db->update( ... );
            // if this changed all linked data must change too
            updateAnother();
            $db->commit();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            $db->rollBack();
            throw $e;
        }
    }
    
    function updateAnother() {
        $db = WebD::Db::getInstance();
        if ($db->transactionStarted()) {
            $db->update( [1] );
            $db->update( [2] );
        } else {
            $db->beginTransaction();
            try {
                $db->update( [1] );
                $db->update( [2] );
                $db->commit();
            } catch (Exception $e) {
                $db->rollBack();
                throw $e;
            }
        }
    }

Added diff for small propsal for Zend\_Db\_Pdo\_Abstract to get open transaction count.

Added Property:

$\_openTransactions = 0
=======================

Changed method(s): + beginTransaction + commit + rollback

Added method(s): + int getOpenTransactionCount(void)

The diferences must created in the abstract class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. (In your diff file it is correct)

Can a connection have more than 1 open transaction ? I think no

Hmm I saw such a implementation in a class am I using for a few month so I thought it is possible to open more than 1 transaction. I really never tested it.

Now i had a situation i needed more than one open transaction and at the end of all i commit/rollback them all. So it is possible and I think we should add this patch/improvement.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try {
        $oDb->startTransaction();
        $oDb->query(QUERY_A);
    
        foreach ($testArray as $key => $value)
        {
            [...]
            try {
                $oDb->startTransaction();
                $oDb->query(QUERY_B);
            }
            catch (Exception $e) {
                $oDb->rollback();
            }
            [...]
        }
    
        [...]
    
        while ($oDb->getTransactionCount() > 0) {
            $oDb->commit();
        }
    }
    catch (Exception $e) {
        while ($oDb->getTransactionCount() > 0) {
            $oDb->rollback();
        }
    }


So QUERY\_A is required, QUERY\_B not and all queries will be commited at the _same_ time.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning as Ralph is the maintainer of Zend\_Db

It would be great to implement getTransactionCount() method at Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract level.

MySQL does not allow nested transaction, there if we call $db->beginTransaction() when it has already been called, it results in a 'PDOException' (I'm using PDO adapter).

For now my quick fix is to use a function as follow:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function isDbTransactionRunning(Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract $dba)
    {
        try {
            $dba->beginTransaction();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            return true;
        }
        $dba->rollBack();
        return false;
    }


It would be so much better/cleaner to have Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::getTransactionCount()

I ran into the following error when saving a row object while a transaction was active: _exception 'Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Exception'_ with message 'Cannot refresh row as parent is missing' in /var/www/library/ZendFramework-1.7.1-minimal/library/Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php:755

This is because when Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row::save() (\_doInsert()/doUpdate()) automatically run ::\_refresh(). Since the transaction is running, ::\_refresh() query fails and raise above mentioned error.

I extended Zend\_Db\_Adapter as well as Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row so that they handle transactions more natively & transparently, below are those classes, I hope it will be usefull for next versions. Basically when a transaction is running, ::\_refresh() call is simply delayed up to when transaction is commited.

Just to correct a typo on class declared on my precedent comment. In method "public function addRowWaitingRefresh($row)" please read:```

Please ignore my comment on \_refresh failing due to running sql transaction.

As William pointed it here (<http://www.qc4blog.com/?p=410>), ::\_refresh error did not come from having a running sql transaction, but from a filtering mechanism I had on Zend\_Db\_Table::\_fetch() that made my newly inserted row not be returned.

Too bad, shame on me :-(

I had a similar problem. I extended the Mysqli adapter to automatically handle "nested" transactions. I've been using it and it works as intended.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php';
    
    class Steam_Db_Adapter_Mysqli extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli
    {
        private $_transactionCount = 0;
        
        /**
         * Begin a transaction.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        protected function _beginTransaction()
        {
            if ($this->_transactionCount === 0)
            {
                $this->_connect();
                $this->_connection->autocommit(false);
            }
            
            $this->_transactionCount++;
        }
    
        /**
         * Commit a transaction.
         *
         * @return void
         */
        protected function _commit()
        {
            $this->_transactionCount--;
            
            if ($this->_transactionCount === 0)
            {
                $this->_connect();
                $this->_connection->commit();
                $this->_connection->autocommit(true);
            }
        }
    }
    
    ?>

hmm... i couldn't find the changes for this issue or any information related to how this was fixed.

 

 

Posted by Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme) (freak) on 2009-08-11T19:07:58.000+0000

What's the status on this issue?

 

 

Posted by Marc Bennewitz (private) (mabe) on 2010-10-06T10:46:51.000+0000

I found a PHP-Bug-Report that it's already implemented in PDO but not documented and tested -> <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52736>

 

 

Posted by Shaddy Zeineddine (shaddyz) on 2010-11-24T20:32:57.000+0000

I have a patch for this issue, which I consider pretty significant. I have been using my own modified class in order to get the desired functionality. Is there a reason why this has not yet been fixed? Is there any way I can submit my patch in some official way? If so, can everyone describe the IDEAL operation. Should nested transactions be handled automatically, should it be an option? should it be done manually using the transaction count?
