ZF-398: Zend\_Cache\_Core throws 'logging feature is on but Zend\_Log is not "loaded"' when logging = false

### Description

When specifying explicitly that logging is turned off in the frontend options array passed to Zend\_Cache::factory( ), the Zend\_Cache\_Core class throws an exception stating that logging is turned on but Zend\_Log is not loaded.

Would recommend changing the following line in Zend\_Cache\_Core::\_setOptions():

if ($name=='logging')

to

if($name == 'logging' && $this->\_options['logging'] == true)
