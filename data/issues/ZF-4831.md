This seems to be an issue with Zend\_Json. It looks like it doesn't convert an ArrayIterator to a JSON array when not using json\_encode().

This is a problem with Zend\_Json\_Encode and is reported in ZF-4874. I've updated the unit tests to mark the test skipped when json\_encode() isn't available in r12421.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
