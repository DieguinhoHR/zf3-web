### Description

the definition of RouteInterface contains a static method, it' not graceful.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface RouteInterface
    {
        /**
         * Priority used for route stacks.
         *
         * @var integer
         * public $priority;
         */
    
        /**
         * Create a new route with given options.
         *
         * @param  array|\Traversable $options
         * @return void
         */
        public static function factory($options = array());


should we modify it like this?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface RouteInterface
    {
        /**
         * Priority used for route stacks.
         *
         * @var integer
         * public $priority;
         */
    
        /**
         * configure route with given options.
         *
         * @param  array|\Traversable $options
         * @return void
         */
        public function configure($options = array());
