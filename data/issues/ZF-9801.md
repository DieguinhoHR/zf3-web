### Description

If the documentation for the Zend\_Application\_Resource\_CacheManager where updates slightly, it would be a lot clearer that you have to get a specific instance of Zend\_Cache\_Manager().

Perhaps a change from:-

Actually retrieving this cache from the Cache Manager is as simple as accessing an instance of the Manager and calling $cacheManager->getCache('database');.

To:-

Actually retrieving this cache from the Cache Manager is as simple as retrieving an instance of the Manager from the Zend\_Application\_Resource and calling getCache();

For Example:-

$cacheManager = $this->getPluginResource('cachemanager')->getCacheManager(); $cache = $cacheManager->getCache('database');

As an afterthought, it would probably do to clarify that $this-> in my example is from within Bootstrap.php.

Fixed in r22115 - please check the Docbook source to see if the new treatment (using an example from Controller code) meets your approval. If it doesn't, there'll be no cookies for you but I'll take on any new suggestions ;).

In the last line of text, "out" needs changing to "our".

But I think it's a lot better now, thanks Padraic!
