### Description

From [proposal page](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Service_Technorati+-+Simone+Carletti):

{quote} Objects used to encapsulate responses are currently using public properties, but these do not fit well for read-only values, since they can be modified. Instead, such properties should be made accessible through getProperty() and setProperty($value) methods, as applicable. As with public properties, this approach also enables automatic code completion for PHP editors that support it. {quote}
