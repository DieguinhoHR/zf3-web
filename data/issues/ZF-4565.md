BTW Does SOAP extension is loaded?

The problem is in Zend/Soap/AutoDiscover.php line 76:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $uri = Zend_Uri::factory('http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);


The problem is that $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] in CLI resolves to the full path of the script and not like in web context. This causes Zend\_Uri to thrown an exception because the full path includes characters like "C:\\Bla Bla" which are of course invalid in an HTTP URI.

This doesn't happen on Unix because the generated path is usually valid, despite that it is not a good URL.

While this causes the tests to fail, it does not indicate a real failure in web context.

Not a problem in Zend\_Uri so it seems.

Soap is per default not loaded in PHP out-of-the-box 5.2.5 for Windows. But the first 3 are URI related and should be independent from the Soap extension looking at the given failure.

Also the unittests should be marked as incomplete if the extension is needed but not available.
