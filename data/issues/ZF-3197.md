ZF-3197: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract - Support schema name in sequence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-05-05T10:16:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-18T02:46:45.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The functions

- lastSequenceId($sequenceName)
- nextSequenceId($sequenceName)

should support schema name as well as sequence name. Could be something like this

- lastSequenceId($sequenceName, $schemaName = null)
- nextSequenceId($sequenceName, $schemaName = null)

The functions for Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle could look something like this ;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function lastSequenceId($sequenceName, $schemaName = null)
    {
      $this->_connect();
    
      $sequence = (!is_null($schemaName)
        ? $this-quoteIdentifier($schemaName) . '.'
        : '';
      $sequence .= $this-quoteIdentifier($sequenceName)
    
      $sql = 'SELECT ' . $sequence . '.CURRVAL FROM dual';
      $value = $this->fetchOne($sql);
    
      return $value;
    }
    
    public function lastSequenceId($sequenceName, $schemaName = null)
    {
      $this->_connect();
    
      $sequence = (!is_null($schemaName)
        ? $this-quoteIdentifier($schemaName) . '.'
        : '';
      $sequence .= $this-quoteIdentifier($sequenceName)
    
      $sql = 'SELECT ' . $sequence . '.NEXTVAL FROM dual';
      $value = $this->fetchOne($sql);
    
      return $value;
    }


I will submit a patch later tonight.

It would be great to know if this will be fixed soon ? and if so when ? :D

I saw this did not come in the 1.5.2 release :(

 

 

Posted by Helgi Hrafn Halldórsson (harabanar) on 2008-07-24T03:07:46.000+0000

I do not agree that this is a "Nice To Have" issue. This is a "Must Have" issue for Oracle users, because the application can be using many schemas at once.

Please consider this and let me know.

Any news on this Issue ??

This is a very critical issue for me and my coworkers. We work við Oracle databases, and it is terrible to have to patch the framework for this to work.

Plz. let me know :D

Why is this not in the 1.7.0 release ??

Helgi,

What value does this add by adding it directly to the Adapter Abstract? I am inclined to say it doesnt belong here as 'schema' is not a universally accepted idea across all RDBMS.

This CAN be added to the signature of child adapters though, and if you see the new db2 adapter, you can see that its in there:

[http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Db2.php)

Let me know,

-Ralph

Hi Ralph,

Thank you for your response. I added $schemaName to the Adapter Abstract since other Adapters are extending it, and to avoid conflicts I thought it would be good to have it default set to null.

But this functionality is must in our case (at my work), because we have multiple schemas in a Oracle database, and we have Table objects that have the $\_schema and $\_sequence parameters set. When we try to save a new row, the Table object executes the nextSequenceId only with the name of the sequence. Which will not work since the sequence is located in the same schema as the table.

But, if this is not working what do you suggest?

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2008-12-16T12:43:20.000+0000

That works, my concern with adding it to the adapter abstract is that multiple rdbms have different notions of what a "schema" is. For example, this would not apply to Mysql and Sqlite. That said, i think the appropriate place to implement this is inside the oracle adapter itself.

That said, it might good to close this one as "not an issue" and open a new one specific to oracle.

What do you think?

 

 

Posted by Helgi Hrafn Halldórsson (harabanar) on 2008-12-16T13:02:28.000+0000

Ok, how do you see the Table object then call for the next sequence id? Since the Abstract will only have an argument for the sequence name? Will the Table object call different function according to Adapter?

But, yes .. if this issue should be implemented only for Oracle adapter I think it would be for the best to create a new issue :D But hopefully we don't have to wait much longer for this functionality to be available :P

ps. If you want any help with development of this, then just let me know. I would be honored to help you with anything in this Framework.

Will address this better within the next 2 weeks. This applies to all RDBMs right?

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-06-24T06:41:33.000+0000

The bigger question here is should the adapter be schema specific? Adding $schema to the sequence retrieval commands seems like it would imply that you can look cross schemas for sequence values, which I am not sure is the ultimate goal here right?

After reviewing the Db2 code, wouldnt it make more sense to support wiring schema inside of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2?

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2011-09-23T15:16:21.000+0000

Ralph: Your comment on 16/Dec/08 indicates to me that this should be implemented directly in the Oracle adapter. Has that been done? I took a quick look into Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle and it appears not. Can it be added in ZF1 at this late stage in it's lifecycle, or should it be pushed up to ZF2 for implementation?

 

 

Posted by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan) on 2012-05-18T02:46:45.000+0000

Too late for ZFv1. This has been addressed in ZFv2 already.
