Attached patch fixing these issues: - For #1, test using assertGreaterThan(20000) instead of exact equality - For #2, search for someone with public photos - in this case I used my sister's user name but feel free to change that :)

I also improved the assertions in testTagSearchOptionSort() - it still fails for me on PHP 5.3 but now the failure is more clear (instead of just saying "failed asserting that 'false' is not 'true'"...). I think this failure might be for a valid reason, and I'll look into it or report separately.
