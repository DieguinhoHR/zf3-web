What OS? I'm not getting these errors on either linux or windows using current trunk.

This may be an issue of not having write permissions to test the caching.

Should be fixed in trunk with r12809 and in 1.7 release branch with r12810; switched to using system temp directory and random temp file.

Updating these issues to mark them resolved for 1.7.1.
