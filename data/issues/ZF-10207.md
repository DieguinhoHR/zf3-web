### Description

I've found one annoying thing, when using Zend\_Currency, which requires whole language+region locale.

In my situation, when trying: $currency = new Zend\_Currency(array('value' => 12.34), new Zend\_Locale()); $currency = new Zend\_Currency(array('value' => 12.34));

...and using browser with: Accept-Language: pl,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 pl has default 1.0 quality factor.

...and having: Environment language pl\_PL, pl Default language en\_US

I get that languages returned:

browser array(3) { ["pl"] => float(1) ["en\_US"] => float(0.7) ["en"] => float(0.7) }

environment array(2) { ["pl\_PL"] => int(1) ["pl"] => int(1) }

default array(1) { ["en"] => bool(true) }

auto array(4) { ["pl"] => float(1) ["en\_US"] => float(0.7) ["en"] => float(0.7) ["pl\_PL"] => int(1) }

Issue: When it comes to choose, 'pl' is returned as locale, which disallows directly using Zend\_Currency().

Solution (request): When there are two languages with the same, highest quality factor, return more detailed one.

General idea: When language has only one region (it's not only Poland, there are more countries/locales like this) there should be returned more detailed locale string ('pl\_PL' instead of 'pl', 'lv\_LV' <= 'lv').

Locale Upgrading is another issue which is already worked on.

Great, thanks.

Another thing that bothers me is when using Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CurrencyTextBox with currency set to, let's say 'PLN', it's displaying well, with all advantages of dijit.form.currencytextbox, but this element actually returns not-localized, plain float to form field.

What makes the problem is Zend\_Validate\_Float, which is using Zend\_Locale. When it receives float string, not number, it does not recognize it as dotted float is not compliant with Polish locale.

Reproduction: 1. Set Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CurrencyTextBox 'value' to 12.34 and 'currency' to 'PLN'. 2. While displaying dijit.form.currencytextbox it displays locale-aware value ('pl\_PL' - 12,34), but imput holds '12.34' 3. Zend\_Validate\_Float gets string '12.34' and does not recognizes it as float, and tries to use Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat($value, array('locale' => $this->\_locale)) - but fails to recognize, because value returned from dijit has dot instead of comma.

I had to create my custom float validator that is exact copy of Zend\_Validate\_Float but has one more check between is\_float() and try{} section - if (is\_string($value) && is\_numeric($value)) - but that is not elegant way, isn't it?

Do I miss the way to force dijit to return localized float value?

Dojo uses it's own validation. It is not combined or related to Zend\_Validate.

The main problem is that Dojo converts all input values to english locale. But when your system uses polish locale you will have problems as you noted because polish is not compatible with english notation.

To make this working you simply have to set english as locale to Zend\_Validate\_Float when you are using Zend\_Dojo as input within your form.

Something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new Zend_Validate_Float(array('locale' => 'en'));

It is good solution when you know that client browser has javascript enabled, but what if you/me/anyone need it working in both situations?

If javascript is disabled, dijit won't convert it to English locale, and there will be message: '12,34' does not appear to be a float.

So still, possible solutions are:

1. find out how to force dijit to return localized value and make Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_CurrencyTextBox to do that (if Zend\_Locale is enabled, otherwise it will be ok)
2. use is\_numeric() in Zend\_Validate\_Float() after is\_float() and before Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat() - not elegant way, might pass not only floats, but does not break app

Closing as duplicate of ZF-6862 for Zend\_Locale (locale upgrading).

For your reply which is not related to the issue:

Please open a new issue when you have problems with Zend\_Dojo with code for reproduction. Same applies for Zend\_Validate when you have problems with this component

Thank you for your report
