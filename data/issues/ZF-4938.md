### Description

- - - - - -

// Set a new destination path $upload->addFilter('Rename', 'C:\\picture\\uploads');

// Set a new destination path and overwrites existing files

$upload->addFilter('Size', array('C:\\picture\\uploads', true));
----------------------------------------------------------------

Second filter should also be 'Rename', not 'Size'

Actually, this is completely wrong. For overwriting files one should use:

$upload->addFilter('Rename', array( 'target' => 'C:\\picture\\uploads', 'overwrite' => true ) );
