### Description

The singleton object of the front controller is clonable because the PHP magic function "\_\_clone()" is not protected. This breaks the design pattern of singleton.

The registry ("Registry.php") may also be affectec, but I am not sure how this works in deep because of the "ArrayObject".

Additional Information: The "Zend/Auth.php" file is also an singleton object, but this object is protected against cloning on runtime. Search to the whole directory does not show more files that are affected.

Affected file: Zend/Controller/Front.php

Possible affected file: Zend/Registry.php
