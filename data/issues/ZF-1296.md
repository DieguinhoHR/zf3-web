ZF-1296: Row and Rowset to provide getTable()

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract both provide setTable() methods, but there appears to be no way to get to the table object once it has been set.

Is this by design, and if so, for what reasons do we not expose this currently write-only property?

Discussions reveal that this is not by design. Add the getTable() methods to make the write-only property read-write.
