### Description

Would be great if i could set an option to the Zend's XMLRPC Client to verify if the server certificate matches with a given certificate and also send a client certificate to the server to authenticate the client as well.

Doing so would be possible to have an HTTPS connection with mutual authentication of both client and server side.
