### Description

The test output:

{panel} 1) testSetExpirationSeconds(Zend\_SessionTest) iteration over default Zend\_Session namespace failed; expecting result === ';a === apple;o === orange;p === pear', but got 'Usage: /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framework/trunk/t ests/Zend/Session/SessionTestHelper.php ' Failed asserting that is true. iteration over default Zend\_Session namespace failed; expecting result === ';a === apple;o === orange;p === pear', but got 'Usage: /home/cawa/ZendFramework/svn/framework/trunk/t ests/Zend/Session/SessionTestHelper.php ' Failed asserting that is true.

2) testSetExpireSessionHops(Zend\_SessionTest) iteration over default Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true. iteration over default Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true.

3) testSetExpireSessionVarsByHops1(Zend\_SessionTest) iteration over named Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true. iteration over named Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true.

4) testSetExpireSessionVarsByHops2(Zend\_SessionTest) iteration over named Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true. iteration over named Zend\_Session namespace failed (result=''; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true.

5) testSetExpireSessionVarsByHopsOnUse(Zend\_SessionTest) unexpected results iterating over named Zend\_Session namespace (result=''; expected ';g === guava;p === plum'; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true. unexpected results iterating over named Zend\_Session namespace (result=''; expected ';g === guava;p === plum'; hop #1) Failed asserting that is true. {panel}

Note! The output is very similar to [ZF-2629] issue, but it's another problem coused by different environment for the tests and Zend\_session test helper script.
