ZF-12223: Zend\_Amf\_Server::setClass() fails after duplicate class registration attempt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Amf\_Server::setClass() (actually it is \_buildDispatchTable()) throws a 'Duplicate method registered: ' exception on a duplicate class registration attempt, which is fine. But the problem is it "remembers" the situation, and therefore it is not possible to register any more classes afterwards.

Sample code:

{quote} $server = new Zend\_Amf\_Server(); $server->setClass("Class1"); try { $server->setClass("Class1"); } catch (Exception $e) { // Swallow "Duplicate method ..." exception } $server->setClass("Class2");

print\_r($server->listMethods()); {quote}

The exception is swallowed at the second attempt of registering Class1, so registering Class2 should be successfull, but it is not, the 'Duplicte ...' exception is thrown again.

Possible problem: In Zend\_Amf\_Server::setClass() on line 780 the new class is added to the \_methods[] array regardless of the registration success. And if \_method[] has more than one item for the same class, from that point \_buildDispatchTable() will always fail, even if a different class is coming.

Possible fix: Remove the last item from \_method[] if \_buildDispatchTable() throws an exception.
