ZF-3249: Use of fopen with '@' triggers error-handler

### Description

The method Zend\_Loader::isReadable() uses fopen to check if a file exists and the @-operator to abort its error-messages:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function isReadable($filename)
    {
        if (!$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {
            return false;
        }
    
        return true;
    }


This _only_ aborts the messages from beeing displayed, the error-handler will be triggert anyway. So if you use your own error-handler, everytime a file is beeing checked with this function and not found (and this may happen very often) a php-notice is thrown and beeing logged into your logfile for example or your database.

Why not use the 'file\_exists()' function of php?

// example with include path:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    static $paths = null;
    if ($paths == null) {
        $paths = explode(PATH_SEPARATOR, get_include_path());
    }
        
    foreach ($paths as $path) {
        $fullpath = $path.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$filename;
        if (file_exists($fullpath)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
          
    return file_exists($filename);

I think it's cause file\_exits() doesn't follow the include path where as the third parameter of fopen() is weather is should use the include path or not.

Hum, just use in you error handler function :

if(error\_reporting() == 0) { return; }

When the error handler catches the error, the @ puts silently error\_reporting level to 0, so you can detect errors comming from 'arobased' instructions.

I think it duplicates with ZF-2985
