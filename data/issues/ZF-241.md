ZF-241: pdo\_pgsql : a notice in the describeTable() method

### Description

There is a notice about an undeclared "length" in the describeTable() method (with pdo\_pgsql)

if ($val['type'] === 'varchar') { // need to add length to the type so we are compatible with // Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql! $val['type'] .= '(' . $val['length'] . ')'; }

The 'length' index is not declared in the SQL query :

$sql = "SELECT a.atttypmod AS length, a.attnum, a.attname AS field, t.typname AS type, " . "a.attnotnull AS isnotnull, " . "( SELECT 't' " . "FROM pg\_index " . "WHERE c.oid = pg\_index.indrelid " . "AND pg\_index.indkey[0] = a.attnum " . "AND pg\_index.indisprimary = 't') AS pri, " . "(SELECT pg\_attrdef.adsrc " . "FROM pg\_attrdef " . "WHERE c.oid = pg\_attrdef.adrelid " . "AND pg\_attrdef.adnum=a.attnum) AS default " . "FROM pg\_attribute a, pg\_class c, pg\_type t " . "WHERE c.relname = '{$table}' " . "AND a.attnum > 0 " . "AND a.attrelid = c.oid " . "AND a.atttypid = t.oid " . "ORDER BY a.attnum ";

The solution is probably to add :

"a.atttypmod AS length"

in the SQL query

but the atttypemod field seems to be the searched length + 4. So I use :

($val['length'] - 4)

I consider this function as a "work in progress", as it has never worked correctly. Instead of trying to get it "perfect" in one pass, let us simply try to improve it sooner, rather than later. Ditto for the other adapters where this function hasn't worked as expected.

Please feel free to patch and commit.

I have no commit rights on Zend\_Db SVN (for the moment, I can only commit to Zend\_Cache subdirectory), so the corresponding patch is attached (better than the initial proposal)

I assign the bug to Gavin (only commit of the attached patch is missing)

Oh ok. I applied the patch, and Rob's Db unit testing patch also. Now we need more unit tests ...

This was committed months ago, but the bug was never marked fixed.

Marking fixed in version 0.2.0, which has now been released.
