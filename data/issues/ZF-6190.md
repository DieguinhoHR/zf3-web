ZF-6190: Break chain on failure always defaults to 'NotEmpty' validator and message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-04-02T08:24:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:31.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Attempting the following does not work as I would expect:

$oForm->addElement( 'text', 'section, array( 'label' => 'Bound Inserts CPT:', 'validators' => array( array( new Zend\_Validate\_Float(), 'breakChainOnFailure' => true ). new Another\_Validator() ), 'filters' => array('StringTrim'), 'allowEmpty' => true ) );

Seen: 'Value is required and can't be empty'

Expected: The validation message from the Float validator.

I realise the documentation states (in its round about way ) that this is what happens but I'd like to have the option instead of having to provide an array of messages for use by the NotEmpty validator.
