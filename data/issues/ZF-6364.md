### Description

Hi,

at the moment, there is no css-catchable structure for elements (and their labels) which are not valid. A

<

ul> tag is appended to the element DOM Node, but you can not add f.e. a red border for this input element with css-only.

This is what the Decorators produce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        Name
    
    


    Enter at least 1 character.
        

And this is what I suggest:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        Name
    
    


    Enter at least 1 character.
        

(I added a css class to the

 and tag) Without that, I have to write my own Decorator to do that, which is not really necessary, if the Default Decorator would add this information to the relevant DOM Nodes.
