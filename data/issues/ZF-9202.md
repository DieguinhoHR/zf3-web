### Description

Extending Zend\_Filter\_PregReplace like the following code will throw fatal error "does not have a valid MatchPattern set". Passing null as options to the constrcutor should not set matchPattern property to NULL, while this property is set in the child class

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Filter/PregReplace.php';
    
    class Ms_View_Filter_LinkArrows extends Zend_Filter_PregReplace{
         
        /**
         * Pattern to match
         * @var mixed
         */
        protected $_matchPattern = array('~(>){3,}~i');
    
        /**
         * Replacement pattern
         * @var mixed
         */
        protected $_replacement = '<i class="arrow-next">Â </i>';
    
    }

This problem may also occur in: Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim Zend\_Filter\_StripTags

I will also review the Validators.
