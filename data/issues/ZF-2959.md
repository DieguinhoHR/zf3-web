### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function isReadable($filename)
        {
            if (!$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {
                return false;
            }
    
            return true;
        }


should be changed to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function isReadable($filename)
        {
            if (!$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {
                return false;
            }
            fclose($fh);
            return true;
        }


to stop open file handles building up with each invocation of the function

Hi, Ralph. If you are OK, Would I fix also this when I would fix ZF-2985 ?

You might want to be sure fclose doesn't fail

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    public static function isReadable($filename)
    {
        if (!$fh = @fopen($filename, 'r', true)) {
            return false;
        }
        return fclose($fh);
    }

I believe it is resolved by ZF-2985
