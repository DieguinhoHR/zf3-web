### Description

Martel has suggested the following accessors for Zend\_View:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Return full path to a view script specified by $name
    public function getScriptPath($name);
    
    // Return full path to a helper class file specified by $name
    public function getHelperPath($name);
    
    // Return full path to a filter class file specified by $name
    public function getFilterPath($name);
    
    // Return helper object specified by $name
    public function getHelper($name);
    
    // Return filter object specified by $name
    public function getFilter($name);
    
    // Return list of all filters
    public function getFilters();

I have taken the liberty to supplement my request by adding another missing thing (passing zend view instance to the helpers) which we were talking about in this particular session. Hope you don't mind :)

Martel -- the optional view instance has been implemented in ZF-1136. Starting work on this issue now.

Removing information about helper view awareness; not relevant to current issue as it has been resolved in ZF-1136.

The functionality was implemented in 4338; I still need to write tests. As noted in the commit comment:

- getHelper() and getFilter() will instantiate the filter of $name if not already instantiated
- getHelpers() and getFilters() only return already instantiated helpers and filters; i.e., they won't return all helpers and filters available
- getHelperPath() and getFilterPath() will instantiate the associated helper or filter in the process of discovering the path, if not already instantiated

Tests finished for r4348.

One note: getFilters() returns the list of filter names -- the view object cannot assume that the filter has been instantiated prior to any calls to getFilters().
