### Description

This implementation of the PUT operation creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3. A PUT copy operation is the same as performing a GET and then a PUT. Adding the request header, x-amz-copy-source, makes the PUT operation copy the source object into the destination bucket.

When copying an object, you can preserve most of the metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, use the x-amz-acl header to specify a new ACL when generating a copy request.

This works well for me. Would be nice to get it in the trunk. Anything we can go to help that?
