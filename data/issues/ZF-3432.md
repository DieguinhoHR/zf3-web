### Description

I got some problems here

I'm trying to use Zend\_Search\_Lucene to index documments from a Digital Library, so the some documments are large. When i try to index all of them at once (they're about 1024 documments) Zend trows a exception of trying to allocate more memory than allowed, so i try to index around 20 documments for turn. If i try to index without optimize, around the 100 documment i get a lot of the error

Php Notice: Undefined offset: xxx in ...Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php on line165

then get a loop (maybe?) in

Php Notice: Unitializeds strinf offset: xxxx in ...Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/File.php on line 322

If i try to optimize a index each time i add the 20 documments, i get this error in the 21 documment added

I dont know what to do

EDIT: Hey people, i got a solution a while ago, and just forget to post here. I add all documments first and them optimize them. The problem is that i cant add a documment in a index that already existis, i got to make a new one, adding all documments again, but if i make a new, no problem

What is your php.ini memory allocation set to? I have some indexing and optimization scripts that require me to ini\_set the memory limit to 1024M or else they fail. Zend\_Search\_Lucene is a memory HOG!

This isn't a bug in Zend\_Search\_Lucene. It is a memory hog by nature, and so if you want to process large indexes you will need to bump up your PHP memory limit settings.

I couldn't reproduce the PHP notices that the OP alluded to, either.

Closing as "Not an Issue"
