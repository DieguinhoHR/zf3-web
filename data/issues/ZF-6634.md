### Description

I have an autoloaded namespace "My\_" (in my include dir APPLICATION\_PATH/lib) I have a module named "My"

When my module resource is boostraped, I have an include warnings form Zend autolaoder :

Warning: include(My/Bootstrap.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /usr/local/share/ZendFramework-1.8.1/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83

What I think :

In Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules, line 71 The "class\_exists call" try to test the class My\_Bootstrap : so the autoloader from the namespace "My" try to load lib/My/Bootstrap.php => no correct, it has to test modules/my/Bootstap.php

My suggest :

in "Application/Resource/Modules.php" : line 71,

Replace "if (!class\_exists($bootstrapClass)) {" By if (!class\_exists($bootstrapClass, false)) {

why ? It hasn't to try autoload because it includes the file in 3 next line (72..74)

This was fixed in a previous release at some point.
