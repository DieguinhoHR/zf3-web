### Description

When you create route like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    $router->addRoute(
            'home',
            new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('/', array(
            'controller' => 'index',
            'action'     => 'index',
            'module'    => 'default'
            ))
    );
    ...


And than call _Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::assemble()_, for example via _Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url_:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    <?= $this->url(array(), 'home') ?>
    ...


You recive Warning: {quote} Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in D:\\xampp\\htdocs\\rdg2\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Router\\Route.php on line 216 {quote}

That occurs because, foreach is not protected for empty _Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::$\_parts_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    /**
         * Assembles user submitted parameters forming a URL path defined by this route
         *
         * @param  array $data An array of variable and value pairs used as parameters
         * @param  boolean $reset Whether or not to set route defaults with those provided in $data
         * @return string Route path with user submitted parameters
         */
        public function assemble($data = array(), $reset = false)
        {
    
            $url = array();
            $flag = false;
    
            
            foreach ($this->_parts as $key => $part) {
    ...


_Solution_: Inserting If stantment:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    if(count($this->_parts)>0)
    foreach ($this->_parts as $key => $part) {
    ...

You can in this case use a static route. This is not only faster then the normal rewrite route, but is also intended for non-variable routes.

Poster can and should use a static route for this sort of situation.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
