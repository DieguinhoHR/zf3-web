### Description

I use Zend\_Session, Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable , my php version is 5.2.0-8 This does not work

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_helper->flashMessenger('test');;
    //in other action
    $this->_helper->flashMessenger->getMessages();


and there are no messages.

Problem is in this code in FlashMessenger class in function addMessage

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     self::$_session->{$this->_namespace}[] = $message;


Quick solution is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
              $data = self::$_session->{$this->_namespace};
              $data[] = $message;
              self::$_session->{$this->_namespace} = $data;

PHP 5.2.0 had breakage with the ArrayObject SPL class, which you are witnessing here; that PHP version is not recommended for general usage (both with ZF as well as in general). Please note that our minimum supported version of PHP is 5.2.4.

Closing, as this is a PHP issue.
