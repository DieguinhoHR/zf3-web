ZF-3548: Improper handling of no-body HTTP responses
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-01T15:28:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:38:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

Currently, Zend\_Http\_Client tries to read a response body even from a response that has no body (eg. 304, 204, no body-length header).

This mostly works but if keep-alive is enabled, it causes major slowdowns because the client tries to read until the connection is closed by the server. Additionally this causes requests with 304 etc. responses to always close (and never utilize keep-alive or persistent modes) - see ZF-3333 as well.

Both are symptoms of the same problem. Solving this one should also solve ZF-3333

Fixed in r. 9870. Does not break BC.
