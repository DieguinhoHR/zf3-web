### Description

Downloaded the full package (stable) and uploaded only the library folder to my linux server. It said that it could not find the RegEx.php. This was true, since the E was not capitalized. Maybe its my unzipper who did this, but it happened on Windows XP to afterwards.

Actually within Zend\_Framework the file is named "Regex.php"... not the lowercased "e".

Normally Windows has no problems using lower- or uppercase names as it's case independent.

From where you ever have this information I don't know. But Zend\_Validate\_Regex is lowercased since it has been released to core.
