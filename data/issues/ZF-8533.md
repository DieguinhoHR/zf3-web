ZF-8533: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract \_fetch() returns only arrays
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The \_fetchAll methode use a hardcoded Constant

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _fetch(Zend_Db_Table_Select $select)
        {
            $stmt = $this->_db->query($select);
            $data = $stmt->fetchAll(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);
            return $data;
        }


i created a patch. It gets the current given constant of the db\_Adapter.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
     protected function _fetch(Zend_Db_Table_Select $select) {
            $stmt = $this->_db->query($select);
            $data = $stmt->fetchAll($this->_db->getFetchMode());
            return $data;
        }

Sorry. Is there an Option to use 2 CodeBlocks. One for the issue and one for the solvation?

I could figure it out.

I used in the model the var rowClass and pointed to the model itself. That causes an error of return only array when i fetchAll() on the modelobject, even when i setFetchMode(Zend\_Db::Fetch\_OBJ).

If change is applied to cause problem to other components of the Db. Example: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.

I do not see this issue as a bug but an improvement.

@peter Because of this improvement?

@ramon

the problen i see is the following: i wrongly set the $\_RowClass in my Modelfile to Admin(s).php in Admins.php instead to set it to Admin.php (my rowclassfile).

This simple mistake causes a return of type array in fetchAll(). It took 3 hours to find the error. So i tried to set the returnvalue explizit to object with setFethMode() but with not success.

It would be very helpfull if the framework would throw an exception of "missing correct \_rowClass definition" or something in that way.

I could only find my mistake of debugging the framework.

Change the hardcoded Constant to dynamic getFechtmode in \_fetch() causes another problem. The rowclass needs assoc as returnvalue to return an array with resultrows.

I am not sure what the feature/bug issue is here.

Zend\_Db\_Table only deals in associative information, as the keys map directly to properties in an object. Other fetch modes would not make must sense. Can someone help me understand the issue here?

@ ralph

its correct, that the result of zend\_db\_table\_row only can be type array. the incorrect use of \_rowClass causes a return of array by using zend\_db\_table\_abstract::fetchAll() instead of type object.

if $\_rowClass would throw an exeption if it points to itselfs or another zend\_db\_table\_abstract class it would be very helpful. Not only for beginners like me.

@ralph

I commented on this does not change was feasible and does not make sense, that would cause some problems in Row.

I will close this issue as "Not a issue".
