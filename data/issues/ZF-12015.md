### Description

Hi,

For now I clear cache files by tag, but sometimes it can be very slow (~500ms) in the case there are a lot of cache files to check for.

Sometimes I need to clear just one or two cache files which I know the name of. Wouldn't it be nice to have the possibility to clear a cache by its name? It seems to me that it will avoid to open each file to check for a matching tag.

This is already possible.

Please see the first example under the heading 'Cleaning the cache' in this manual page: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.theory.html)
