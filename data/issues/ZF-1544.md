ZF-1544: HTTP Digest Authentication

### Description

I tried to use the digest authentication with the PHP SoapClient but could not authenticate, because the request contained the following data, which could not be parsed correctly:

Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Restricted area", nonce="466d6becada18", uri="/webservice/soap.php", qop="auth", nc="00000001", cnonce="3416a75f", response="5eae5612c149202e3c97b9128fbdffce", opaque="cdce8a5c95a1427d74df7acbf41c9ce0"

The problem are the quotes of the nc parameter. To fix it, change the following line in Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http::\_parseDigestAuth()

$ret = preg\_match('/nc=([0-9A-Fa-f]{8})/', $header, $temp);

to

$ret = preg\_match('/nc="?([0-9A-Fa-f]{8})"?/', $header, $temp);

Bye, Christoph

PS: I modified the method to ignore missing algorithm parameters - would be good to change this, too (as done with the username).

Fixed with revision 5260. Changed parsing of the client's Authorization header: \* Quotes around the nonce count are now tolerated, even though technically they shouldn't be there. \* Now allows the client to omit the algorithm argument, and defaults to MD5, as per RFC2617.

Note that defaulting to MD5 like this actually gives the client a perhaps undesirable level of control; they can effectively force the server to use the MD5 algorithm. Even if the server is configured to use something else (such as MD5-sess) and sends that in the WWW-Authenticate header. All the client has to do is just omit the algorithm argument on its Authorization header.
