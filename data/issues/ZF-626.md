ZF-626: "Exception thrown without a stack frame" when adding document using static variables

### Description

I get this error: Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0

With this code:

class Search\_Test { private static $lucene;

static function test() { self::$lucene = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene('path/to/index', true); $doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document(); self::$lucene->addDocument($doc); } } Search\_Test::test();

If the code is changed to use normal non-static variables for the "lucene" object, it works without error.

I'm not sure if this is really a bug or if it's supposed to be that way, but it took me awhile to figure out the cause of this error as the error message is rather lean of information.

Assigning to Alexander.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene commits data within destructor.

Static variables are destructed later and exception handling engine may be already unloaded.

Use $index->commmit(); before end of script.

Done.
