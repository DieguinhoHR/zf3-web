### Description

It appears Zend\_Log does not return an instance of itself at the moment, but for convenience it might be a good idea to return $this where possible

I see no justification for this change. Can you explain why it's more convenient to do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Zend_Log(...);
    $log->addWriter(...)
        ->info(...);


Instead of this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Zend_Log(...);
    $log->addWriter(...);
    $log->info(...);


Especially since in typical usage, the call to addWriter() and the call to info() are not close together in one's application. Typically, logs are set up in the bootstrap, and then messages are output in many places in the code.

Another use case is where one might want to output to multiple log levels when a single log event occurs in the app:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log->info( ...some short message... );
    $log->debug( ...some longer message... );


Is it really so painful to write $log twice in such cases? I don't think so.

It is for cases where several filters or writers are added not for chaining log events after Zend\_Log instantiation because as you said logs are typically setup in the bootstrap.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Zend_Log(...);
    $log->addWriter(...)
            ->addFilter($filter)
            ->addFilter($filter2);


Of course it does not matter whether we have to hit a few extra keys, but it does make things easier by shaving off 0.5 seconds when setting up Zend\_Log.

I think optimizing keystrokes is not really the intended value of fluent interfaces. And returning $this does not a fluent interface make.

I had a discussion with the designer of this component, and he said he didn't implement the function to return $this because the design of this API is not designed to be a true fluent interface according to the Martin Fowler pattern. In fact, most of the instances of functions that return $this in Zend Framework aren't proper fluent interfaces.

I'm sorry, but the use case for this feature request is not convincing.
