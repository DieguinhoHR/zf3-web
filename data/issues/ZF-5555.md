Not able to reproduce this behaviour:

The validated key is set at initiation of the HTTP adapter. It is never unset only changed to true and false and always available.

When the validated key is not available then probably something was overwritten or you are using an outdated release.

Please give a reproducable example of your problem.

Hello,

I've reproduce this issue doing this :

- make a controller in which you set a Zend\_Form $form
- $form should contain an input file ($file)
- create the view, omitting the input file element \*\* go to webbrowser an post this form
- when executed
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->isValid($post)


the following method produce the message {quote}Notice: Undefined index: validated in /var/www/project/library/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 578{quote}

This seems to append when Zend\_Form try to validate a non posted input file element. Hope this help.

@Jérôme: Please note that this issue is marked as "fixed with ZF 1.7.3".

Additionally in the actual release ZF1.8 there is no codeline which reads "if ($content['validated'] === true) {"

Therefor this issue remains as "incomplete"

OK Thomas, thanks.

FYI, my test was made using ZF 1.7.7

Regards.
