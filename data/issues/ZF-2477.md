### Description

On forms labels are most of time writed with upercase (first letter) as: Name

Under Zend\_Form, if we going to use multilangual approach the translation is writed using smallcaps (if text into translation is smallcaps also). Rather should be rendered by default as uppercase.

I forgot to say, this should be for config based forms.

{quote} if we going to use multilangual approach the translation is writed using smallcaps (if text into translation is smallcaps also) {quote}

The key to this is the last part of that quote: _if_ text into translation is smallcaps. There's nothing saying your messageid and translations need to be smallcaps.

Translation messageids and translated strings can be any case you desire. Not an issue.
