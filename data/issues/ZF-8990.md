### Description

In line 2940 we have following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $return = $this->_calcdetail($calc, $date, self::DATE_MEDIUM, 'de');


The valid code should look as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $return = $this->_calcdetail($calc, $date, self::DATE_MEDIUM, $locale);

Please tell me what your exact problem is.

The given code works as expected and sets the date within the date object regardless of the used locale. I will not change working code from core without a reproducable problem.

Closing as non-issue.

Note that the mentioned method normalizes any given input to a defined locale. This way Zend\_Date know where the content should be.

It would be nonsense to normalize by localizing content. Then day, month or year could be switched and it would not be possible to know which part exactly is what it has been said to be.

You are totally right. I misunderstand this part of code.
