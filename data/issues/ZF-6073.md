ZF-6073: Unnecessary key in Zend\_Form\_Element validators foreach loop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Line 1294 reads: foreach ($this->getValidators() as $key => $validator) { but $key is never used.

As this is a frequent loop maybe it will help a little in performance taking out the $key index mapping.

This is a micro-optimization at best.
