### Description

MimeTypeTest::testBasic() on trunk is failing on 32bit Ubuntu.

1) Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeTypeTest::testBasic Test expected true with 'image/jpg' Messages: array ( 'fileMimeTypeFalse' => 'The file \\'picture.jpg\\' has a false mimetype of \\'image/jpeg\\'', ) Failed asserting that matches expected .

After checking the test file, it appears the mime type is reported as jpeg, not jpg as expected in the test

$ file tests/Zend/Validate/File/\_files/picture.jpg tests/Zend/Validate/File/\_files/picture.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01

Suggested change to fix unit test.

This change breaks unittests on Windows.

You have to note that the mimetype is given by FileInfo or mimetype. There are several versions available and not all of them give the same result.

Your suggested patch can therefor not be applied.
