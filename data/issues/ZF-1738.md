### Description

If you use fetchObject with a query that have no result you get this response :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    invalid argument supplied in foreach on line 363 in Zend/Db/Statement.php


currently fetchObject look like this :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $row = $this->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);
    foreach ($row as $key => $val) {
        $obj->$key = $val;
    }


if $row is null the foreach statement crash.

I suggest to test $row

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $row = $this->fetch(Zend_Db::FETCH_ASSOC);
    if( isset($row) ) {
           foreach ($row as $key => $val) {
                $obj->$key = $val;
            }
    }
