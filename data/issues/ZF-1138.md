Resolved in r4308.

Did not apply the patch as-is. Instead, if $name is passed but is not a valid key, returns false. Otherwise, if no $name passed, clears all segments, and if a valid $name is passed, clears that segment only.

Excellent! That was more than I hoped for in time for the 0.9.2 release :)
