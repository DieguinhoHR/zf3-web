### Description

Some doc blocks in the Zend Framework are formatted like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    @param 

The correct way is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    @param

Actually the $param is optional:

"NOTE: as of 0.4.1, @param can document phpdoc.de-style, with optional $paramname"

[http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/â€¦](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.param.pkg.html)

I'll fix them though. But since it's not a bug I can't promise it will be "corrected" fast.
