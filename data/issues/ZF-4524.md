### Description

The testcase "testNamespaceExceptionClassNotFound", in _Zend\_Filter\_InputTest_ makes the wrong assertion. Currently, when the namespace is omitted on purpose, an assertion is made that the exception should equal the string "Plugin by name MyDigits was not found in the registry".

However, the exception message also returns in which paths has been searched to find the plugin. Thus the assertion should be changed to an "assertContains" instead of "assertEquals".
