### Description

Hi everyone. I'm new here, maybe someone has reported allready such an improvement. There is a possibility to make ZF work on PHP 5.0.4 (and I suppose on all 5.0.x versions) without PDO extension.

All we need for it is:

1. Countalbe class definition (somewhere in Zend.php)
2. A DB MySQLi Adpater.

I am succeed with 1) and most part of 2). I can show a working version of my project on PHP 5.0.4.

I estimate my version of MySQLi Adapter is 70% ready. Some methods are to be finished there.

Hi Eugene,

We have a very broken, out-of-date Zend\_Db adapter for MySQLi (not using PDO) here: [http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Db/Adapter)

Is your version all new, or based on the original attempt at writing a MySQLi adapter?

I'm glad to have your help on this component. Lets get a [CLA](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/xgE) signed and submitted, so that we can accept a patch from you.

Cheers, Gavin

Hi Gavin,

I was faced with necessity to make ZF work on PHP 5.0.4, so I saw Zend\_DB\_Adapter\_MySQLi and tried to use it but it did not work.

This version is an extension of abstract Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract class with some methods modified to work with mysqli.so library, it has nothing in common with old version of Zend\_DB\_Adapter\_MySQLi.

Since I am still modifying my class, it is to too early to speak about a fully functioning patch, but I believe after I finish the development, we can decrease ZF requirements to PHP 5.0 (and no need of PDO).

Definition of Countable class presents no difficulties I believe, right? =) I tested Zend\_Cache, Zend\_Config, Zend\_Controller and Zend\_View packages on PHP 5.0.4, all of them works successfully after Countable definition.

Let's stay in touch. I estimate the class will be ready in 2-3 weeks.

Eugene is working on complete rewrite, and is now the author / maintainer.

 

 

Posted by Eugene Panaitov (eugenep) on 2006-10-04T15:16:52.000+0000

Anybody can help me testing. The class is almost ready now. See incubator\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Mysqli.php

I found a bug(?). I was using the svn version.

    require_once 'Zend.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Db.php';

$dbconfig = array('host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'dbtest', 'password' => 'dbtest', 'dbname' => 'dbtest');

$db = Zend\_Db::factory('mysqli', $dbconfig);

$result = $db->listTables();

Zend::dump($result);

Error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method mysqli\_result::fetchAll() in /srv/www/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 348

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

Hello

I needed MySQLi support for one of my projects so I played a little bit with it. In attached file is modified version of MySQLi Statement and Adapter. It works much more better than one from SVN ;-)

Posted by Eugene Panaitov (eugenep) on 2006-12-04T18:06:46.000+0000

Thanks, Milan. Your code looks good. I'll test it and add it to repository in a few days. If you want to continue changing code and get an access to SVN commitment, you should sign the CLA.

 

 

Posted by sfet (sfet) on 2006-12-04T19:06:17.000+0000

I do so as soon as possible :-)

 

 

Posted by Eugene Panaitov (eugenep) on 2006-12-10T13:01:55.000+0000

Hi Milan. I reviewed your code. You added mysqli\_statemant support in the adapter, that's good. Finally somebody should do that.

I tried to run it locally, but there were some critical errors related to MySQL localization and settings.

E.g. we have a table with fieldnames with underscores. Statement's prepare did not parse it correctly: it split field name before replacing them with `?` by the underscore and instead of one name `field_name` method resulted two fields `field` and `name`.

Also in describeTable function MySQL can output a column description array with uppercased fieldnames as well as lowercased, camelized and so on. It depends on MySQL settings.

I truly believe your code will work at last. I will go through the rest of the code and fix everything soon.

 

 

Posted by Eugene Panaitov (eugenep) on 2006-12-10T13:03:34.000+0000

By the way, Gavin, I remember we talked about some plugins that can help in solving these localization based errors. Can you tell me what is the situation with these plugins?

 

 

Posted by sfet (sfet) on 2006-12-10T16:32:27.000+0000

Hello Eugene.

I'm not sure but I think problem with "field names with underscores" is matter of Zend\_Db\_Statment. Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli just uses Zend\_Db\_Statement's \_sqlParams property and \_joinSql() method for solving this problem. execute() method does not do anything with field names. It just replaces all field names found in \_sqlParams property with '?'.

 

 

Posted by Eugene Panaitov (eugenep) on 2006-12-10T16:41:54.000+0000

Milan, right, the key code is this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _prepSql($sql)
        {
            // split into text and params
            $this->_sqlSplit = preg_split(
                "/(\?|\:[a-z_]+)/",  // note here I added underscore into split pattern chars. It is temporary solution, best way is preparing field names before using statement.
                $sql,
                -1,
                PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE|PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY
            );
    
            // map params
            $this->_sqlParam = array();
            foreach ($this->_sqlSplit as $key => $val) {
                if ($val[0] == ':' || $val[0] == '?') {
                    $this->_sqlParam[] = $val; // key *2 +1 is the parsed position
                }
            }
    
            // set up for binding
            $this->_bindParam = array();
    
        } 


 

 

Posted by sfet (sfet) on 2006-12-10T16:54:13.000+0000

That's strange. I have that underscore in my Zend\_Db\_Statement ;) Maybe I solved this problem before but have forget that I did so ;-) I should use SVN to be able to see all changes I have done. I thought that I changed just adapter and statement and I didn't take note that I changed something else. How does it work, now?

I found some messages:

Strict Standards: Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated in /home/allen/ZendFramework-0.6.0/incubator/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php on line 273

Strict Standards: Declaration of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_MySQLi::fetchAll() should be compatible with that of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::fetchAll() in /home/allen/ZendFramework-0.6.0/incubator/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php on line 55

Not serious, but better to be looked into.

Implementation is complete in revision 3639. All Zend\_Db unit tests pass using the Mysqli adapter.

Moved to core in revision 3853.
