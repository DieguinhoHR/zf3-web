ZF-4368: Patch for setObject() in Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover
----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover has no setObject() function as addition to setClass(). its a little 3 liner to fetch the class from this and call setClass(). The method would just be for convenience, since you could if needed do this in your application.

Why setObject() anyways? well maybe you wan't to generate wsdl files from dynamic classes and the classes are created in a factory. so you have an object and want to auto discover it.

Patch is attached.

Patch.

Also the AutoDiscover file has quite some whitespace problems that should be solved. There are many intended whitespaces that fill up empty lines. I left them out the patch though.

This is not really a missing feature since its easy to do $autodiscover->setClass(get\_class($object));

AutoDiscover does not need object instantiated for anything relevant.
