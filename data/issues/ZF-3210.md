ZF-3210: wrong detaction of installed pdo
-----------------------------------------

### Description

In class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract on line 94 the pdo detaction is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    !extension_loaded('pdo')


but on my WinXP machine with php5.2.5 the extension names PDO (upper case)

Please check the installed pdo extension in upper case too.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    !extension_loaded('pdo') || extension_loaded('PDO')

Strange, because I cant reproduce the bug ( on WinXP and PHP 5.2.6, should be same for PHP 5.2.5 ).

var\_dump(extension\_loaded('pdo')); // true if pdo is present var\_dump(extension\_loaded('PDO')); // true if pdo is present var\_dump(extension\_loaded('PdO')); // true if pdo is present

It seems like extension\_loaded() doesn't care about case at all, are you sure of what you advance ? Could you then test on PHP 5.2.6 ?

Thx

Not an issue.
