### Description

running: php 5.2.4 on Amazon EC2 (not sure if that makes any difference, but may aswell contribute details)

uploading a range of sizes of videos > 50 megs

I hacked up the exception to give me some stats maybe they'll help

the only constant (ish) is that it fails around 2M of data sent out

here is my test results from trying to upload 3 videos:

on defaults

Error writing request to server: chunk 2414 written: 2471936 of 44585668 time elapsed: 2.2388999462128 Error writing request to server: chunk 2344 written: 2400256 of 86913724 time elapsed: 2.058305978775 Error writing request to server: chunk 2359 written: 2415616 of 162668524 time elapsed: 2.0696811676025

with persistent connections

1M chunks

Error writing request to server: chunk 4 written: 4194304 of 44585668 time elapsed: 2.6670641899109 Error writing request to server: chunk 4 written: 4194304 of 86913724 time elapsed: 2.0670289993286 Error writing request to server: chunk 4 written: 4194304 of 162668524 time elapsed: 1.3411540985107

1byte chunks (I just wanted the magic failing size to narrow itself down as much as possible)

Error writing request to server: chunk 2129272 written: 2129272 of 44585668 time elapsed: 36.720845937729 Error writing request to server: chunk 2129757 written: 2129757 of 86913724 time elapsed: 47.438073158264 Error writing request to server: chunk 2133572 written: 2133572 of 162668524 time elapsed: 41.758239030838

it seems like time is no factor in this .. the 30 second 1 byte buffer requests still fail just around an exact 2MiB 2.0 - 2.03 or so

it really looks like a 2MiB limit or something ..

I'm kind of lost as to what may be causing it

.. php's socket code could be flaky .. the Centos php-5.2.4 build could have flaky socket code .. amazon could be doing something weird, but then again .. the same videos uploaded to viddler work like a charm, I send them through php's curl integration .. It could be youtube resetting the connection .. but that would just be lame ..

is there a curl version of the streaming adaptor in the works?

ok I'll actually list the versions I've tested with, but I'm pretty sure everything inbetween is affected

Dropping priority to "Critical".

Blocker is only used for issues that prevent further framework development.
