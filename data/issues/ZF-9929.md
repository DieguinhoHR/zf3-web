ZF-9929: Add possibility to stop executing actions after redirect without stopping php engine

### Description

Sometimes, it is necessary to stop executing actions after redirect, but not to stop php engine with exit() or die(). It is required, for instance, by PHPUnit. Currently, there is no such option with Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector. With setExit(true) it performs exit, with setExit(false) it continues to execute controller actions. The solution is to \_forward to some dummy action/controller after redirect, but I think it would be convinient to have an option to cancel action in redirector API.

Why don't you just prefix the call to the redirector with 'return '? By using that the execution of the action should be stopped right after redirecting without doing anything to the php engine.

What if I want to perform a redirect in preDispatch?
