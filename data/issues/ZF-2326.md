throwExceptions() does not implement a fluid interface by design; it is intended as both a setter and a getter (i.e., use the same method to set the state as to retrieve the current state).

But the API docs writes that the flag is defaults to true, so it couldn't be used to get the state. Something must be wrong here.

API docs can lie, and in this case do.

Look at the code, please. The $\_throwExceptions class flag is false by default. throwExceptions() allows you to do the following: \* pass no flags: returns the current state \* pass a true value as a flag: sets the $\_throwExceptions flag and returns the current object (i.e., chainable) \* pass a false value as a flag: sets the $\_throwExceptions flag and returns the current object (i.e., chainable)

I've updated the docblock in svn to make this clearer.

Sorry, I use the API docs when I work.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
