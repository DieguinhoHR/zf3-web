### Description

The message ID created by createMessageId via setMessageId() is not valid according to RFC 2822 (section 3.6.4) as I see it. It is missing a start '<' and end '>', causing spamassassin to score 2.6 on this alone. Fix should be trivial.

Thank You for report, Henrik.

I will fix as soon as I will return back from Holiday. ;-)
