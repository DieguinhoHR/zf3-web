### Description

I need to get stand-alone month list in wide mode.

Because in Russian language 'format' and 'stand-alone' names are different.

I think that solution could be like this:

 
            case 'month_standalone' :
                return Zend_Locale_Data::getContent($locale, 'monthlist', array('gregorian', 'stand-alone', 'wide'));


Thanks!

Just do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Locale/Data.php';
    $list = Zend_Locale_Data::getContent('ru_RU', 'monthlist', array('gregorian', 'standalone', 'wide'));


Zend\_Locale returns only the standard formats which are used within ZF core. It would not be good to return all variants because the visibility of the API would be broken.

No one would have an overview with it (except me) when all 70 formats are integrated. And there are still several informations which are not included within Zend\_Locale\_Data because the new version provides additional ones.

There is also one big problem... not all languages support this informations. We integrated the informations which are covered by almost 90% of all languages. So for shortterm it's better to have this two lines written than importing new problems. Maybe we will do this when the new CLDR version is avaiable but then not only this one but also other additional informations.

But thank you for your interest and suggestion.

Added with SVN-7272. See additional data "month\_complete" and use the needed data from the returned array
