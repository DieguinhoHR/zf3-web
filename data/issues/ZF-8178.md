### Description

Hello.

There are some missing images in the downloaded documentation.

Specifically ...

images/tip.png images/important.png images/note.png images/warning.png images/caution.png

In addition to this, the downloaded documentation mentions images/note.png, but this image does not exist online, nor is it the same filename requested by the online documentation. Online it is images/note.gif
