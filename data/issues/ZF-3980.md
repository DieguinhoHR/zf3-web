ZF-3980: Zend\_Locale unable to use user's browser locale settings
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-18T02:19:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:39:14.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

In the constructor of Zend\_Locale, each protected autodetected locale is populated calling getDefault(mode, false). Using false as the second argument pushes the environment autodetected locale over the browser's one. So if I set Romanian in the browser, an English locale comes down from the environment setting and becomes the first choice.

If I'm missing something, my bad. But at this point I can't seem to be able to use the user's browser locale. In my opinion, in Zend\_Locale's constructor (and I think in another place in that file), the getDefault method should be called with true as the second argument.

Suggested fix following; the \_auto member would be ok to be built after the original behavior, merging browser and environment. But \_browser and \_environment should only contain those locales.

Taken a look at the trunk version - seems much closer to what I imagined ;) Haven't tested it yet but you may close this issue - seems pretty much solved. Thanks!

By the way, why can't I post comments?

The I18N core can changed 4 weeks ago but is not allowed to be integrated until 1.7. Can you please try if you have problems with actual trunk and give us feedback ?
