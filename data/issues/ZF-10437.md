Are you using the standalone Zend\_GData package, or a Zend Framework installation?

CHECK my recent post on this matter

The problem is in the DEMO on the standalone. In the App.php there is a missing include resource

adding line to App.php

require\_once 'Zend/Uri/Http.php';

Resolves this issue. I ran this down please fix in the DEMO for others.
