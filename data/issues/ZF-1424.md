i think this would be very useful.

Note that the getColumnMeta() method is experimental in PDO, and it is not implemented by any PDO drivers, as far as I know.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Seems as though this functionality is possible via Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_::describeTable() functionality, and perhaps best belongs there?

Reopen if this is still something you want to see implemented and ill reevaluate.
