### Description

Offline compilation of documentation fails with error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">/usr/bin/xsltproc --xinclude --output html/index.html html.xsl _temp_manual.xml
    error : No such file or directory
    warning: failed to load external entity "http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl"
    compilation error: file html.xsl line 6 element import
    xsl:import : unable to load <a href="http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl">http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/…</a>
    make: *** [html/index.html] Error 5

Why theese files are not distributed with ZF?

 
    <pre class="highlight">DOCBOOK_DTD=<a href="http://framework.zend.com/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd">http://framework.zend.com/docbook/xml/…</a>
    DOCBOOK_XSL=<a href="http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl">http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/htmlhelp/…</a>
    DOCBOOK_FO_XSL=<a href="http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/fo/docbook.xsl">http://framework.zend.com/docbook-xsl/fo/…</a>

You could simply download the docbook standard to have the files locally and change the directory target. Simply said these files would increase the ZF size unnecessary.

And you need more than those 3 files as these are referring to several others.

Still an issue, as of today:

An error occurred with this request: Invalid controller specified (docbook-xsl).

I'm guessing the files are not located correctly on the web server.

Either make them available where the build scripts are looking for them, or update the READMEs to indicate the external dependencies.

Wil: This worked in past. Somewhere between 1.5 and today Zend blocked docbook from being downloaded so all links in the manual regarding docbook are broken.

These can be found in makefile.in and manual.xml.

Of course they can manually be changed to point to a local destination like I described it, but I think IF the docbook files are no longer available for public then the standard definitions should be made changeable for users and you should document this in the readme

Alex, could you please look in to this?

It's actualy resolved.

The problem had been in the .htaccess update which blocked access to some resources within document\_root, but it was fixed lately.

PS DOCBOOK\_DTD and DOCBOOK\_XSL environment variables usage for off-line builds is derived from the manual build scripts (Makefile.in). But probably should also be described somewhere.
