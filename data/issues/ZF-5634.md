ZF-5634: Zend\_Form with optional file elements

### Description

I have a form with 2 optional ('required' => false) elements. When I call $myForm->isValid(), I received an Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception ("my\_element" not found by file transfer adapter). When I traced the exception, Zend\_Fom::isValid call Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::isValid which call Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::\_getFiles to begin without parameter $noexception even if option 'ignoreNoFile' is set to true.

Tested with trunk SVN 13803

Please read the FAQ <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFFAQ/Forms>

FYI: An non-existing form element has nothing to do with an not uploaded file.

The exception is thrown because the form element was not found. The ignoreNoFile option handles only not uploaded files on existing form elements.

??? The form element exists and is showed to user but not mandatory. It is an element among others. When the user doesn't add the file to the complete form and when i call isValid on this form, i received this exception. Is it normal?

Only because the form exists it does not mean that it is rendered correct.

You have not shown any related code for reproduction. Is the hidden field displayed... is the element named correct... and so on...

As already said... you will get this exception when the element is not rendered correct... rendering is not viewing... you don't see all necessary data.

The FAQ points you to the problem... wrong usage of setDecorator. And yes... in this case the problem is normal.. as for all other form elements which are in need of correct decorators like image, captcha and others.

My decorators are:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addDecorator('File')    // <- I have the File decorator
         ->addDecorator('Errors')
         ->addDecorator('Label', array('class' => 'ui-accordion-header ui-helper-reset ui-state-default ui-corner-all label'))
         ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'div' , 'class' => 'element'));


My creation of file element is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->addElement('file',
            'ctrl_sip_b',
            array('label' => 'Fichier de contrÃ´le matrice B' ,
                    'required' => false));

This was resolved by adding:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setAttrib('enctype', Zend_Form::ENCTYPE_MULTIPART);

The problem was that the form had not set "enctype". ->setAttrib('enctype', Zend\_Form::ENCTYPE\_MULTIPART) solves the problem.
