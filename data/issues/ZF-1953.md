### Description

Hello, I find a mistake in "Example 8.3. get() - output a date" on "8.3. Basic Methods".

I see following sentenses, // Output of the desired date print $date->get();

But It seems like to return timestamp. I think "Output of the desired timestamp" is correct.

I hope it will be useful.

Zend\_Date->get() returns an Date Object.

But Zend\_Date also includes the magic \_\_toString method which automatically converts the object to string so it can be printed on screen.

This means

$obj = Zend\_Date->get() result in an Object

print $obj calls automatically the \_\_toString method and returns the timestamp as this is the base representation of a date.
