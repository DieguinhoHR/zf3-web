### Description

I have all my Filenames First-Letter-Uppercase, so i like to set the viewRender to render this files, but i like to use only lowercase in an url. With an action-name its easy to convert

 
    <pre class="highlight">$actionname = $viewRenderder->getScriptAction ();
    $viewRenderer->setScriptAction (ucfirst ($actionname));

But i see no way, to set my personal Controller- or Module-Name without overwriting methods.

Edit: I see (but i didnt think ^^), tha getScriptAction didnt work in preDispatch ^^ So this issue can be closed (it was to fast :X)

Can somebody remove this :X Ive to think about it -.-
