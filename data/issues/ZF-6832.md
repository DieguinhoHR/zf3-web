### Description

Zend\_Dom\_Query\_ResultTest cannot be executed directly as the PHPUnit\_MAIN\_METHOD is set to 'Zend\_Dom\_Query\_Css2XpathTest::main()'.

Please change it to: Zend\_Dom\_Query\_ResultTest::main().

I will attached the fixed file.

Cheers,

Rob

Just checking now, there's no main() method either. Is this intentional or have I jumped the gun?
