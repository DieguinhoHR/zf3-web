### Description

There is an inconsistency with the naming of custom view helpers that goes against the general coding standard convention. Custom view helpers are required to be named as specified in the manual:

"The class name must be Zend\_View\_Helper\_\*, where \* is the helper name itself. E.g., if you were writing a helper called "specialPurpose", the class name would be "Zend\_View\_Helper\_SpecialPurpose" (note the capitalization)."

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.custom)

Yet the manual also states:

"IMPORTANT: Code that operates with the framework but is not part of the framework, e.g. code written by a framework end-user and not Zend or one of the framework's partner companies, must never start with "Zend\_"."

The latter naming convention should really also apply to view helpers for much the same reason it was specified in the first place.

I agree with you on this point.

In fact I question the reason you have to define a separate class for every function you want to add. I opted to extend Zend\_View myself and have found it beneficial.

Changed the bug category to Docs: Improvement

This pertains to the documentation teams :)

It's not just a documentation issue. As the reporter notes, having to specify Zend\_View\_(Helper|Filter)\_XXX as the class name breaks with the coding standards, and also breaks portability (for instance, the helpers and filters could be used with Solar and/or Savant, and vice versa, if the names did not need to follow those conventions.

This is a fairly complex change to implement, but can definitely be done (Solar already has done it, for instance).

Solar does this with a two-fold mechanism: setting the directory for helpers and a class prefix to use with the directory. My thought on the matter is to do something similar:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setHelperPath($path, $classPrefix = 'Zend_View_Helper');


Then, internally, these would be stored as prefix -> path. (This schema would apply for filters as well).

addHelperPath(), setHelperPath(), addFilterPath(), and setFilterPath() now all take an optional argument, $classPrefix, indicating the prefix to use with helpers/filters in the directory; by default, it uses 'Zend\_View\_(Helper|Filter)'.

Current as of revision 1913.
