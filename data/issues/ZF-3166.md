### Description

Brandon Clark raised a good point in off-list e-mail and we came up with a solution that would help people creating alternate adapters for Zend\_View (e.g., Zend\_View\_PhpTal).

Because PHPTAL templates only have access to the variables passed to them (and no reference to the Zend\_View\_Interface instance), calling helpers requires either:

1) Explicitly assigning $this to a template variable, which breaks encapsulation, or

2) Having Zend\_View\_Abstract::$\_helper be a reference to a Zend\_View\_HelperBroker object, like the action controllers have Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker.

This seems like a logical split to me. Thoughts?

Can you provide either some inline code samples or a link to some samples showing why this is necessary? It's hard to gauge from your description.

Thanks!

Removing assignment until we have more feedback.

Sure. See Brandon's proposed method of making view helpers available to PHPTAL:

The relevant line is 19, $this->this = $this;. This allows the view code to access the layout view helper. This doesn't really seem ideal, though. My thought was to have a Zend\_View\_HelperBroker object to encapsulate all the helper interaction, and be able to assign that instead of $this.

But now that I think about it, it seems like it would make more sense to have a Zend\_View\_Context object which only has access to view helpers and any variables assigned to it. That way all of the private properties in Zend\_View\_Abstract could be protected. In other words, all the helper methods would move to Zend\_View\_Context and assign() would assign variables to a Zend\_View\_Context object.

I think the idea of a Context object is good; however, there are some implementation details that would make it impossible to use it with many of our supported PHP versions.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->foo[] = 42;


is the relevant test case here. This worked fine in 5.1.x, but then in 5.2.0, the PHP team made \_\_get() no longer return arrays by reference, which made the above not work. In addition, ArrayObject was broken in 5.2.0 and, iirc, 5.2.1, such that using \_\_get to proxy to an ArrayObject in that fashion did not work either. Right now, we actually set variables as public members, which makes everything work fine on all versions -- but using a Context object would necessitate using \_\_get() again.

A helper broker does seem like a good target, however, and with the changes to Zend\_View\_Abstract currently in the incubator, would be trivial to implement. The one thing I worry about, however, is that this would introduce a BC break. If so, we'd need to schedule it for 2.0.0.

Can one of you come up with a prototype based on current incubator Zend\_View code so we can evaluate what breaks there may be?

Sounds good; I'll see what I can come up with.

Whew. I slapped this together in about an hour and a half tonight based on a checkout I did a couple days ago (9348). There are quite a few changes here, but I did my best to not break backwards compatibility, to the point of leaving in a lot of proxy methods in Zend\_View which, if you use these ideas, you'll most likely want to pare down or at least deprecate. I removed a grand total of one method from Zend\_View that I'm pretty sure was for testing (having to do with helperLoadedDir, etc.) because I only had about two hours to spare for this, but I'm pretty sure you can easily figure out how to put it back in.

OK, here's the executive summary:

- I created a Zend\_View\_Context object which acts as the variable store and provides access to view helpers
- I created Zend\_View\_HelperBroker based on both Zend\_View and Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker. This is necessary to remove any Zend\_View reference in the context object. There are no static methods or properties in Zend\_View\_HelperBroker, though.
- Scripts can no longer call render() directly, of course, since that requires a reference to Zend\_View. There's a better alternative that people should switch to instead: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial.
- Zend\_View::\_run() became Zend\_View\_Context::run(). Not sure about the implications of this in terms of userland extensibility, but it was necessary in order to render the script within the scope of Zend\_View\_Context.
- Changed all private methods in Zend\_View\_Abstract to protected, then moved everything from Zend\_View\_Abstract into Zend\_View and deleted Abstract altogether as it no longer served any purpose. Any type checking in userland view adapters should be based on Zend\_View\_Interface anyway.

So the gain here is that Zend\_View is now completely extensible (no more wholesale copying and pasting in derivative classes) and view scripts have no way to access anything besides what they're supposed to have access to: variables and helpers.

Anyway, hope that helps give you an idea of where I was coming from. Let me know what you think.

Scheduling for next major release, but may revisit before then. The suggested solution offers no backwards compatitility, and thus could not be added until we work on 2.0. There may be another solution, however, but it is not within the scope of even the next minor release.

Assigning to Matthew as he will be the person tracking this from the Zend team. Matthew, feel free to mark this postponed if you would like to keep it out of your open issues queue.
