### Description

The error is thrown because the constant doesn't exist in that class found in Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority version 1.9.10 alpha. the potential fix is attached:

    -            $config['priority'] = constant($config['priority']);
    +        if (!is_numeric($config['priority'])) {
    +            $config['priority'] = constant("Zend_Log::".$config['priority']);
             }

Thank you for reporting this issue. I am currently enjoying my holidays, but will fix it on January 1st. (unless I turn out to have (more) wifi available).

I think that

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    constant("Zend_Log::".$config['priority']);


is debatable. Because such solution disallow us to use constants from other classes (e.g. own classes).

But both _is\_numeric_ and _type_ _casting_ to integer required. Because any atomic data goes from config goes as string and now we can't setup priority via number

I added the class to find the constant to address the warning shown in the report as well, because the class Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority has no constants defined. So this might require a bit of an architectural fix to accommodate developer defined constants. I should have noted that I'm using php 5.3.

I tried to reproduce, but was not able. Please do provide (much) more information on how to reproduce. The used reproduction code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">    public function testNumericLogStreamFilterParamsPriorityDoesNotFail() {
            $options = array('stream' =>
                            array('writerName'   => 'Stream',
                                  'writerParams' => array('stream' => "php://memory",
                                                          'mode' => 'a'),
                            array('filterName' => 'Priority'),
                            array('filterParams' => array('priority' => 4))));
            $resource = new Zend_Application_Resource_Log($options);
            $resource->setBootstrap($this->bootstrap);
            $resource->init();
        }

that should have been `array('filterParams' => array('priority' => '4'))));` since from the config ini it's a string. also note I'm using php 5.3. I'll try to write the failing testCase

Adding quotes around the 4 makes no difference.

The correct test case is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testNumericLogStreamFilterParamsPriorityDoesNotFail() {
            $options = array('stream' =>
                            array('writerName'   => 'Stream',
                                  'writerParams' => array('stream' => "php://memory",
                                                          'mode' => 'a'),
                            'filterName' => 'Priority',
                            'filterParams' => array('priority' => '4')));
            $resource = new Zend_Application_Resource_Log($options);
            $resource->setBootstrap($this->bootstrap);
            $resource->init();
        }


The test case you are using never tests filters because your 'filterName' is wrapped in an array and line 138 is never hit in Zend/Log.php
