### Description

I have a situation where I combine a DB log, cache and a self written adapter for Zend\_Translate resulting in a "Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency" error when the translation was retrieved from the cache. I was able to solve this issue based on a solution to an older issue with Zend\_Pdf.

I changed the Zend\_Translate\_Adapter on line 338 from: } else if ((isset($this->\_options[$key]) and ($this->\_options[$key] != $option)) or to: } else if ((isset($this->\_options[$key]) and ($this->\_options[$key] !== $option)) or

which fixes the issue
