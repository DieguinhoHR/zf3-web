### Description

on register a session validator using registerValidator it store the validator informations in the session before it is started

Therefore the following code is not applicable:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Session::setOptions( array(/* ... */) );
    Zend_Sesion::registerValidator( new Zend_Session_Validator_HttpUserAgent() ); // this will write data in $_SESSION['__ZF']['VALID']
    
    // ...
    
    // action that use sessions
    $mysession = new Zend_Session_Namespace('mysession');  // this will start the session if it is not started

Changed priority to minor, since an easy workaround is present (start the session first; e.g., in your bootstrap or elsewhere, call Zend\_Session::start()).

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
