### Description

Starting with Zend\_Application i figured out that the examples in the ZF manual does not work.

Keys from array constructor are handled as lowercase, but after this point additional keys from config will not be converted to lowercase -> the zf docu lacks, because examples like resource.frontController = xxx inside config will not work (but work using setOptions)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setOptions(array $options){
            $options = array_change_key_case($options, CASE_LOWER);
            if (!empty($options['config'])) {
                $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $this->_loadConfig($options['config']));
            }...


The problem is, that lower case is apllied on the $options array, but later on loading default options from config is not handled the same way.

I came across the same problem, I used the following fix for now:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
        public function setOptions(array $options)
        {
            $options = array_change_key_case($options, CASE_LOWER);
    
            if (!empty($options['config'])) {
                $configOptions = $this->_loadConfig($options['config']);
                $configOptions = array_change_key_case($configOptions, CASE_LOWER);
                    $options = $this->mergeOptions($options, $configOptions);
            }

Please try with 1.9.2; this functionality has changed with the introduction of that release, and the problem may now be a non-issue.
