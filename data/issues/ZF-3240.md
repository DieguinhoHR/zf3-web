### Description

Today I took closer look at Zend\_Http\_Client. Here is what I found out:

\*\_\_constructor\* docblock lists non-existant parameter \*$headers\* whilst it doesnt list \*$config\* parameter

 
    <pre class="highlight">
         /**
         * Contructor method. Will create a new HTTP client. Accepts the target
         * URL and optionally and array of headers.
         *
         * @param Zend_Uri_Http|string $uri
         * @param array $headers Optional request headers to set
         */
        public function __construct($uri = null, $config = null)


some methods are tagged with _@throws_ and some are not. Mainly: \* setConfig \* setMethod \* setHeaders \* setCookieJar \* setCookie \* setFileUpload \* setAuth \* setAdapter \* request \* prepare\_body \* encodeAuthHeader

some methods are missing _@return_: \* \_setParameter \* setAdapter

_getHeader_ has

 
    <pre class="highlight">.
    I believe this should be 

.

not documented in manual _$config_ key _storeresponse_. Default value is _true_. It allows for retrieval of _Zend\_Http\_Reponse_ after calling _request_ by _getLastResponse_. If set to _false_ _getLastReponse_ will return _null_ instead.

The manual states "When set to false, some validation functions will be skipped." about _strict_ _$config_ key. The problem is what _some_ means. It should mention that when _true_ it performs validation against header names to see if they contain forbidden characters.

non BC changes to consider: setAdapter doesnt have _return_ statement, it could return _$this_ to aid fluent interface like other set methods do

Thanks for all those patches, we are working on them actually ;-) There are some more improvements to make the code fit the coding standards
