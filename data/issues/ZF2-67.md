### Description

Right now, there is a generate() method on each code element (PhpClass, PhpMember, etc.) which makes it hard to customize the code that is generated by these methods. Instead of this generate() method, I would propose to use the visitor pattern instead and move that code to a visitor which then traverses the several code elements and generates the code.
