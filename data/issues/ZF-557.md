ZF-557: Unexpected behaviour in Zend\_Db\_Table->find()
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-11-15T07:55:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

The find() method of Zend\_Db\_Table accepts either a single value or an array as parameter. In case you provide an array they function will only retrieve results if the array has more then one elements. Since you might want to use find() on a generated list of ids this behaviour complicates scripts unnessecarily.

The responsible line of code is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if (count($val) > 1) {


Instead there should be something like:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if (is_array($val)) {

See also ZF-21 for another confusing behavior of the find() method. We should resolve both of these.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.
