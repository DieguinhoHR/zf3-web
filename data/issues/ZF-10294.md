### Description

Hello,

I've made to get languages per country using Zend\_Locale. We are located in Spain and the returned list is incomplete.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      $LanguageToTerritory = Zend_Locale::getTranslationList('LanguageToTerritory');
    
      print_r($LanguageToTerritory['ES']);


RETURNED RESULT

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    ast es eu gl


EXPECTED RESULT

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    ast ca es eu gl


"ca" is for "catalan"

It seems that datas exist in Zend\_Locale xml file...

"ca" is noted as "AD" (andorra). For "ES" catalan is only noted as secondary which means not official.
