### Description

h3.Details

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Simplify AJAX context switching based on requested format
     */
    class Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Json extends Zend_Controller_Action_Helper_Abstract
    {
        // Suppress exit when sendJson() called
        public $suppressExit = false;
    
        // Encode JSON response and immediately send
        public function sendJson($data, $keepLayouts = false)
        {
            $data = $this->encodeJson($data, $keepLayouts);
            $response = $this->getResponse();
            $response->setBody($data);
    
            if (!$this->suppressExit) {
                $response->sendResponse();
                exit;
            }
    
            return $data;
        }
    ...


Everything's ok here only if we assume that no controller plugin adds http headers to Zend\_Controller\_Response. Otherwise, we get lack of expected headers inserted by FC's plugins.

For example, one of this affected plugin is Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders (extends Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract) which inserts firephp-related headers with its flush() method initially triggered by "\_plugins->dispatchLoopShutdown()" in front controller.

h3.Test case Zend\_Registry::get('log') returns Zend\_Logger object with firebug writer.

h4.Works

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Registry::get('log')->info('Test debug msg...'); // WILL send firebug headers


h4.Doesn't work

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Registry::get('log')->info('Test debug msg...'); // Will NOT send firebug headers
    $this->_helper->Json($data);


h3. Temporary Workaround for Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $json = $this->getHelper('Json');
    $json->suppressExit = true;
    $json->sendJson($foo);
    Zend_Wildfire_Channel_HttpHeaders::getInstance()->flush();
    $json->getResponse()->sendResponse();
    exit;

For Zend\_Wildfire\_Channel\_HttpHeaders, the problem could be solved by registering a listener/plugin on Zend\_Controller\_Response that gets notified when sendResponse() or more specifically sendHeaders() is called. This would work for any other plugins that need to send headers as well.

See ZF-4181 for another reason for needing a listener for sendHeaders() for the Response object.

Marked as won't fix for the following reasons:

1. The helper explicitly notes that it's purpose it to immediately send the response when called sendJson().
2. I can see two possible solutions for deferring the immediate sending using the sendJson() and direct() methods to return the JSON without calling sendResponse().

It appears that the issue is not a bug but a disagreement over the nature/API of the helper. Such disagreements do not constitute a valid issue.
