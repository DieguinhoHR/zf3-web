### Description

There's a typo in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_FormErrors::getShowCustomFormErrors which generates a Notice level PHP message when getShowCustomFormErrors is called and the showCustomFormErrors options has been provided to the FormErrors decorator.

To reproduce, create a Zend\_Form and add the FormErrors decorator: array('FormErrors', array('showCustomFormErrors' => true))

This issue exists, for certain, in 1.11.3; it is present in svn trunk at r23798 and so must also exist in 1.11.4 - it likely exists in previous versions too.

patch against latest trunk:
