### Description

Currency formatting isn't correct when using nl\_BE as locale.

Zend\_Registry::set('Zend\_Currency', new Zend\_Currency('nl\_BE')); $this->currency(50); Gives as result: 50,00 €

This should be: € 50,00

However when using nl\_NL as locale the formatting is correct.

Fix: /Locale/Data/nl\_BE.xml

Change currencyFormat > pattern to: ¤#,##0.00

According to CLDR the format to use for currencies is >#,##0.00 ¤<

This means that ZF produces the correct output. When you wish to use another output simply give the wished format. When you feel that there is an error within CLDR please report an issue at <http://cldr.unicode.org>

You should note that even the actual release of CLDR which is 3 weeks old, provides the same format pattern.
