ZF-2338: Exif data not parsed from photo entries
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-12-19T16:49:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-02-26T12:56:00.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.4 (26/Feb/08)

### Description

Exif data is not currently being parsed from photo entries because: a) the namespace for Exif is not defined in Zend\_Gdata\_Photos b) Exif/Extension/Tags was broken, not passing the dom element when creating children

There are also missing tests for the Exif classes. This fixes some, but more needed to be added.
