### Description

I have a Zend\_Db\_Select object that does several one-to-many joins on multiple tables. I am passing that select object to view's "paginationControl" helper. The number of rows I get is, for example, 5 but the paginator control's "totalItemCount" property says 11.

Here is some example code:

Zend\_Db\_Select generation in the controller action Note ->distinct()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $c->getAdapter()->select()->distinct();
    $select->from(array('c' => 'table0'), array(
        '*',
    ));
    $select->joinLeft(array('t' => 'table1'),
        'c.id = t.id',
        array()
    );
    $select->joinLeft(array('f' => 'table2'),
        'c.id = f.id',
        array()
    );


Then I assign the paginator object to the view:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($select);
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);
    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(10);
    $this->view->items = $paginator;


After that I'm printing the paginator in the view like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = array(...);
    print $this->paginationControl($this->items, Options::PAGINATOR_STYLE, '_pagination.phtml', $params);


And just in case, here's how the counts in the \_pagination.phtml are printed:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    print 'Showing ' . $this->firstItemNumber . ' - ' . $this->lastItemNumber . ' of ' . $this->totalItemCount . ' results (' . $this->itemCountPerPage . ' per page)';


The output is: "Showing 1 - 5 of 11 results (10 per page)"

To summarize it all - the amount of row objects in the paginator is correct but totalItemCount is not.

Can you add a ->distinct() to your select?

 

 

Posted by Andris Causs (cypher) on 2009-12-02T04:31:43.000+0000

Yes. If you "print $select" the result will be: SELECT DISTINCT c.\* FROM table0 AS c LEFT JOIN table1 AS t ON c.id = t.id LEFT JOIN table2 AS f ON c.id = f.id;

Also, here's a link to the documentation: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html#zend.db.select.building.distinct)

I think this isnt a bug. you have to provide example table structure and data. I havnt reproducted it with my Data here.

 

 

Posted by Andris Causs (cypher) on 2009-12-02T05:06:29.000+0000

OK, let's say you've got two tables: table0: id | field\_a | field\_b | field\_c

table1: id | field\_d

the contents could be like this: table0: 1 | a | a | a 2 | b | b | b 3 | c | c | c

table1: 1 | x 1 | y 1 | z 2 | p 2 | q 3 | f 3 | g 3 | h

So, if you do SELECT t0.\* FROM table0 AS t0 LEFT JOIN table1 AS t1 ON t0.id = t1.id; ...you will get 8 rows just because there are 8 rows in table1.

What I infact need is to get unique rows from table0, hence I need to add DISTINCT: SELECT DISTINCT t0.\* FROM table0 AS t0 LEFT JOIN table1 AS t1 ON t0.id = t1.id;

In this case you get 3 rows.

Now, I pass this object to Zend\_Paginator::factory() it creates the paginator object. When I do foreach ($paginator as $item) {} it will print 4 rows, which is correct but when I print the page numbers it says that there are 8 items. That is the bug that I'm trying to describe.

Sorry, I can't supply you any specific table structures as it's an internal company project.

Can you please attach to this issue your partial view paginator rendering script, a sql dump and other details so that it is more easier to reproduct that all? :)

 

 

Posted by Andris Causs (cypher) on 2009-12-02T05:13:59.000+0000

Sorry, there's a typo - instead of "it will print 4 rows" it should say "it will print 3 rows".

Just a quick update.

Here is the output of my $select->\_\_toString() (Zend\_Db\_Select that I pass to the paginator):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT DISTINCT c.* FROM ctr_details AS c
    LEFT JOIN ctr_tags AS t ON c.contract_id = t.contract_id
    LEFT JOIN ctr_files AS f ON c.contract_id = f.contract_id
    GROUP BY c.contract_id


// I added $select->group('c.contract\_id') thinking that it might group all the rows when counting

And here is the output of $paginator->getAdapter()->getCountSelect()->\_\_toString():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT COUNT(1) AS `zend_paginator_row_count` FROM ctr_details AS c
    LEFT JOIN ctr_tags AS t ON c.contract_id = t.contract_id
    LEFT JOIN ctr_files AS f ON c.contract_id = f.contract_id


As you can see GROUP BY is gone as well.

The problem seems to be in Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect::getCountSelect().

OK, found a dirty workaround for those that stumble upon this page and want a quick fix. As you probably know there's a function in Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect called setRowCount (). It allows you to specify a custom Zend\_Db\_Select object to use in counting the rows.

This is what I did:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $c->getAdapter()->select()->distinct();
    $select_count = $c->getAdapter()->select();
    
    // generate the select object
    $select->from(array('c' => $c->getTableName()), array(
        '*',
    ));
    $select->joinLeft(array('t' => $t->getTableName()),
        'c.contract_id = t.contract_id',
        array()
    );
    $select->joinLeft(array('f' => $f->getTableName()),
        'c.contract_id = f.contract_id',
        array()
    );
    
    // generate the count select object
    $select_count->from(array('c' => $c->getTableName()), array(
        new Zend_Db_Expr('COUNT(DISTINCT c.contract_id) AS ' . Zend_Paginator_Adapter_DbSelect::ROW_COUNT_COLUMN),
    ));
    $select_count->joinLeft(array('t' => $t->getTableName()),
        'c.contract_id = t.contract_id',
        array()
    );
    $select_count->joinLeft(array('f' => $f->getTableName()),
        'c.contract_id = f.contract_id',
        array()
    );
    
    // ...
    
    $adapter = new Zend_Paginator_Adapter_DbSelect($select);
    $adapter->setRowCount($select_count);
    
    $paginator = new Zend_Paginator($adapter);
    
    $this->view->contracts = $paginator;


I know it's not the coolest approach but at least it works.

I seem to have a similar problem using Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect. <?php echo $this->totalItemCount ?> in my control.phtml is always 10, even though there are 50 pages with 10 items each.

 

 

Posted by Ivan Krechetov (ikr) on 2010-01-07T01:22:28.000+0000

Correction: it's not always 10 for me, on the last page it's 8. So, looks like totalItemCount has actually the value of currentItemCount.

Forget my comments. Found a bug in my code.

 

 

Posted by Marco Kaiser (bate) on 2010-05-31T01:04:36.000+0000

i tested it and i cannot reproduce your bug, i fixed some lines of code in Zend\_Paginator, please test with the latest code and if still exists please reopen.

Marco,

If the issue cannot be reproduced, please do not "fix some lines of code". If there is an issue with those lines, consider opening a new issue. Also, please mention the revision numbers :)

Cheers,

Jurriën

I can confirm I am seeing the same results when I perform a query with joins that needs a distinct on one table.

My original query looks like this :

 
    <pre class="literal">
    SELECT DISTINCT `t1`.* 
    FROM `table1` AS `t1` 
    INNER JOIN `table2` AS `t2` ON t1.columna = t2.columna
    LEFT JOIN `table3` AS `t3` ON t2.columnb = t3.columnb


Inside the dBSelect adapter, at line 260, if I perform \_\_toString() on $this->\_countSelect I get the following:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    SELECT COUNT(1) AS `zend_paginator_row_count` 
    FROM `table1` AS `t1` 
    INNER JOIN `table2` AS `t2` ON t1.columna = t2.columna
    LEFT JOIN `table3` AS `t3` ON t2.columnb = t3.columnb


This is returning an incorrect count due to the lack of the distinct statement which is need due to multiple rows being created during the join process.

I think it would be hard for the method to dynamically get around this issue and so the solution for me is to alter the check at line 217 to pick up my situation and do the count around a sub-query as it does in other situations. Although probably not the most efficient way to count the rows, it does provide the correct result. With the code I am working on it would be difficult to provide a dynamically created custom query just for the count.

I basically just check there is only one column part and that is uses a wildcard. This then makes the adapter and paginator work perfectly for my query.
