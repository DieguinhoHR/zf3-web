### Description

Many of developers rely on formats like json to do stuff like small bits of application logic and object definitions.

Personally, I use json a lot, and my json files get really long and complex. That's why I think it would be nice if I could include some comments in my json strings. But the problem is, the decoder is unable to strip these comments out and fails to decode the string. And that makes working with complex json strings difficult and unsuitable for big projects.

So maybe having an option to tell Zend\_Json\_Decode to allow comments in the strings would be a big time server for people who heavily use json (instead of xml) in their projects.

Hey Aria.

There is one fundamental problem with your idea. _Comments are not allowed_ inside JSON data, as defined by JSON standard (<http://www.json.org/>).

This means if Json\_Decode read/manipulated comments, it wouldn't be JSON anymore and it wouldn't be named Json\_Decode.

Here is a discussion on JSON and comments in JSON (with some workarounds) [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/â€¦](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/244777/can-i-comment-a-json-file)

Marking issue as "Won't Fix", as comments are not part of the JSON specification.
