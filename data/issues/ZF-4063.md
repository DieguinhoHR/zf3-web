### Description

Within Zend\_Form\_Element objects, it's currently possible to specify that the validation chain be broken if a particular validator fails. I.e., in the following scenario:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->name->setValidators(array(
        array('StringLength', true, array(5, 255)),
        'EmailAddress'
    ));
    $form->name->isValid('fish');
    foreach ($form->name->getErrors() as $error) {
        echo $error . PHP_EOL;
    }


Only one error will be output, because the string 'fish' fails the StringLength validator. It wouldn't pass the EmailAddress validator either, but since breakChainOnFailure is set to true, the EmailAddress validator never fires.

However, it'd be nice to be able to do this kind of chain-breaking on the Form level as well; i.e., given a form with two elements, it would be possible to specify that if the first element fails validation, the second shouldn't be checked at all.

This would mainly be useful for cases in which the validators for a particular element would perform actions that are undesirable when the whole form is invalid; i.e., the File element, which currently uploads its file as part of the validation process.

This is not the case... the validation and upload process of files has been seperated a few days ago.
