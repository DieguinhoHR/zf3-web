In ZF1.0RC2, line 495 of /library/Zend/Gdata/App.php throws a new Zend\_Gdata\_App\_HttpException--well it tries to, anyway, but this class was never previously defined anywhere in that file. Accordingly, the following line should be inserted immediately prior to throwing the exception:

```

Thanks for the report and sorry for the troubles. This is a duplicate of ZF-1528 and has been resolved in svn revision 5202. This will be in the RC3 release, but also hopefully in a patch release for the separate GData download.
