ZF-4944: Problem of Zend\_Date::addDay
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-11-14T01:40:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-14T02:20:11.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I found a problem of Zend\_Date:

[code] <?php require\_once 'Zend/Date.php';

date\_default\_timezone\_set('Asia/Taipei');

$today = new Zend\_Date(); $today->setDate('2008-11-21');

$expireDateTime = clone $today; $expireDateTime->addDay(40);

echo $expireDateTime->toString('YYYY-MM-dd');

// expect : 2008-12-31 // actual : 2009-12-31 [/code]

When I used addDay method to add $today to year 2001~2008, month 12, and day 29~31, the year would be wrong.

For Example:

2008-11-09 + 50(days) = 2009-12-29 (wrong) 2008-11-01 + 50(days) = 2008-12-21 (right) 2007-11-21 + 40(days) = 2008-12-31 (wrong) 2007-11-11 + 50(days) = 2008-12-31 (wrong) 2009-11-11 + 50(days) = 2009-12-31 (right) 2009-11-21 + 40(days) = 2008-12-31 (right) 2000-11-21 + 40(days) = 2000-12-31 (right) 2001-11-21 + 40(days) = 2002-12-31 (wrong) ...

Is this a bug? Or missing out something?

Please forget my poor english.
