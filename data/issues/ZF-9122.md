### Description

Welcome

I have translated the documentation page for the Zend\_Db\_Select component into my mother tongue (polish).

Unfortunately I do not have the permission to save changes to the documentation repository at [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/documentation/manual/pl) so I can not make any commits.

I am not sure if there is something wrong or this is intentional so that not everyone gets the permission straight away.

What should I do to commit the changes?

Obviously my CLA has been processed and I have a JIRA account. I have been unable to get any reply from the polish translation team leader for nearly 2 months.
