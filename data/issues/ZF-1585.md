ZF-1585: Calendar/LinkTest and Calendar/WebContentTest do not properly verify that all elements are copied correctly

### Description

The unit tests Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_LinkTest and Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_WebContentTest each contain a typo preventing verification that associated elements can be exported to XML and successfully reimported.

This problem seems to be localized to these two unit tests.

Hi Trevor thanks for the patch, but FYI we cannot accept code submissions unless you have signed a Zend Framework CLA. I don't see your name in our CLA database, and I do recall seeing a June 7th email in which Darby told you that we require a CLA on file before we can grant privileges to post proposals on our wiki. The same applies to code submissions in patches.

Please see [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)

Bill, Sorry, I wasn't aware that CLA was also required to submit patches too. Consider the patch retracted.
