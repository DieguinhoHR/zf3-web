ZF-9264: Running Gapps class's suspend() or restore() on non-existing accounts results in fatal error

### Description

When the suspend() or restore() method in Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps is run on a non-existing user, a fatal error is thrown.

Test code:

$domain = 'gsatech.com.sg'; $username = "admin\_account@$domain"; $password = 'password';

$client = Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($username, $password, Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps::AUTH\_SERVICE\_NAME); $gapps = new Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps($client, $domain);

$nonExistingUser = 'nobodynobody'; $gapps->suspendUser($nonExistingUser);

The above will result in the error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::save() in /home/cheeze/public\_html/jotterlab/library/Zend/Gdata/Gapps.php on line 788

A similar problem exists for restoreUser().

A better solution is to throw an exception. The following lines:

if ($user === null) { throw new Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps\_ServiceException(); }

can be placed right after the calling of retrieveUser() in both the functions.
