### Description

I think that if the 3rd parameter cannot be null than it won't have null as it's default value. The only one thing that is needed is to edit file Zend/Translate/Adapter.php and change line 108 from

$this->setLocale($locale);

to

if ( $locale !== null ) $this->setLocale($locale);

The third parameter can be null, because it defaults then to the default language. When you have a different default language then "en" you must set it.

You will only get an exception in the case that the language your user requests is not supported and additionally also your server environment does not have a language you wanted to set.

So only when there is no way to set any language you will fail to initiate Zend\_Translate.

When we would suppress the failed setting of the requested language like proposed by you, we will have problems afterwards. Therefor this is not seen as bug, but as expected behaviour.
