### Description

Hello.

I checked the bugs and I see nothing about the issues I found yesterday into the Zend\_Mime component.

What I do ? I am making an http request and the answer comes as multipart/mixed, with 2 parts, first is an text/xml and the second is a binary file.

Result: The binary file got corrupted because: 1. you are using string functions instead of multibyte string functions in splitMime... and I think in other Mime components... but they are not involved (see Zend\_Mime\_Message::\_disassembleMime)

1. you have some strange line inside those functions marked with TODO:
 

    <pre class="literal"> 
            // TODO: we're ignoring \r for now - is this function fast enough and is it safe to asume noone needs \r?
            $body = str_replace("\r", '', $body); 


- I had to comment it not to corrupt the binary file.

1. The result after I put mb\_string to work and took out the str\_replace at point 2... has 1 byte in plus. Something is fishy into the substr you are using... not sure, but I think I solved this one also by considering $p as being too big...

Here is the diff:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
         public static function splitMime($body, $boundary)
         {
             // TODO: we're ignoring \r for now - is this function fast enough and is it safe to asume noone needs \r?
    -        $body = str_replace("\r", '', $body);
    +        // $body = str_replace("\r", '', $body);
     
             $start = 0;
             $res = array();
             // find every mime part limiter and cut out the
             // string before it.
             // the part before the first boundary string is discarded:
    -        $p = strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . "\n", $start);
    +        $p = mb_strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . "\n", $start);
             if ($p === false) {
                 // no parts found!
                 return array();
             }
     
             // position after first boundary line
    -        $start = $p + 3 + strlen($boundary);
    +        $start = $p + 3 + mb_strlen($boundary);
     
    -        while (($p = strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . "\n", $start)) !== false) {
    -            $res[] = substr($body, $start, $p-$start);
    -            $start = $p + 3 + strlen($boundary);
    +        while (($p = mb_strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . "\n", $start)) !== false) {
    +            $res[] = mb_substr($body, $start, $p-$start - 1);
    +            $start = $p + 3 + mb_strlen($boundary);
             }
     
             // no more parts, find end boundary
    -        $p = strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . '--', $start);
    +        $p = mb_strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . '--', $start);
             if ($p===false) {
                 throw new Zend_Exception('Not a valid Mime Message: End Missing');
             }
     
             // the remaining part also needs to be parsed:
    -        $res[] = substr($body, $start, $p-$start);
    +        $res[] = mb_substr($body, $start, $p-$start - 1);
             return $res;
         }


With base64\_encoded attachments all is OK ... of course, as the Zend\_Mail is working probably properly.

Thank you for a resolution on this.

Hi, I have the same behavior here. ZF Version 1.11.10. This line seem to corrupt the whole content.
