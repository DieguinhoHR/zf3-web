### Description

Caching is not working correctly when using Zend\_Paginator to paginate Zend\_Db\_Select results. The values are being cached (I can see the files in my cache location), but they are not being used.

The problem is that the cache IDs are being generated incorrectly.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Dashboard_Feed extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        protected $_name = 'FEED';
        protected $_primary = 'FEED_ID';
    }


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $feed = new Dashboard_Feed( Zend_Registry::get('db') );
    $select = $feed->select()->order('FEED_TITLE' );
    
    $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory( $select );
    $paginator->setCache( Zend_Registry::get('cache') );
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber( $this->_getParam('page', 1) );
    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(10);


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    cache.frontend.type = "Core"
    cache.frontend.options.automatic_serialization = true
    cache.frontend.options.cache_id_prefix = "dashboard_"
    
    cache.backend.type = "File"
    cache.backend.options.cache_dir = APPLICATION_PATH "/../data/cache/"


Db adapter is Oracle

Upon first execution, _zend\_cache---dashboard\_Zend\_Paginator\_1\_81a9b1f25e24763494338baa43444b99_ is creating in my cache directory - so far so good.

I make a change to one of the items in the DB and refresh. I should _not_ see the change since the results are cached; however, I do see it. Zend\_Paginator went back to the database to get the info.

I looked into the Zend\_Paginator.php to attempt to get to the bottom of the issue. The problem can be observed in _getItemsByPage(...)_. See the comments I inserted.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getItemsByPage($pageNumber)
    {
        $pageNumber = $this->normalizePageNumber($pageNumber);
    
        if ($this->_cacheEnabled()) {
            // here, _getCacheId(...)  returns "Zend_Paginator_1_a479583744ccc3a9c4d653c390e7ff7f"
            $data = self::$_cache->load($this->_getCacheId($pageNumber));
            if ($data !== false) {
                return $data;
            }
        }
    
        $offset = ($pageNumber - 1) * $this->_itemCountPerPage;
    
        $items = $this->_adapter->getItems($offset, $this->_itemCountPerPage);
    
        $filter = $this->getFilter();
    
        if ($filter !== null) {
            $items = $filter->filter($items);
        }
    
        if (!$items instanceof Traversable) {
            $items = new ArrayIterator($items);
        }
    
        if ($this->_cacheEnabled()) {
            // here, _getCacheId(...)  returns "Zend_Paginator_1_81a9b1f25e24763494338baa43444b99"
            self::$_cache->save($items, $this->_getCacheId($pageNumber), array($this->_getCacheInternalId()));
        }
    
        return $items;
    }


As you can see, when the items are cached, the cache ID corresponds to what was created in my cache directory (obviously), but when Paginator tries to _read_ the cache, it's looking for the wrong ID!

The source of the problem is that _\_getCacheInternalId()_ serializes the adapter to identify the cache entry.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _getCacheInternalId()
    {
        return md5(serialize($this->_adapter).$this->_itemCountPerPage);
    }


Of course, the adapter's state is going to be different after results are retrieved vs before they are retrieved, so this mechanism cannot work. I saved the serialized value of the adapter from the first and second calls to \_getInternalCacheId() to a file and did a diff... there are several differences.

The problem is _greatly_ exacerbated if one is using Zend\_Db\_Profiler. I was using the profiler to determine if the cache was working correctly. Instead, Zend\_Paginator was creating a brand new cache entry _with a different ID each time_ every time I reloaded the page. Why? Well, the profiler contains performance information on the queries that have been run thus far. This information will be different from request to request 99.99% of the time. Different content = different serialization = different cacheId.

I would appreciate it if anybody can comment on this bug and perhaps queue up a resolution for the next ZF patch/release.

I am devising a workaround to use in my project and will post it here for the benefit of others who have encountered this problem.

Duplicates #ZF-6989 , even if it gives more informations (will be linked into #ZF-6989)

Please, get the patch attached to ZF-6989 and make a use case. We are actually looking for help to test that in order to provide a patch the better it could be.
