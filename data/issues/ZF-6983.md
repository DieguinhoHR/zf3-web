### Description

If I use file scanning with language as a part of a filename (myfile.de.mo) it recognized "mo" as the language instead of "de".

If there is a file "data/lang/test.de.mo" this

 
    <pre class="highlight">$translate = new Zend_Translate_Adapter_Gettext('data/lang/',null,array('scan'=>Zend_Translate_Adapter::LOCALE_FILENAME));
    var_dump ($translate->getList());

returns

 
    <pre class="highlight">array
      'mo' => string 'mo' (length=2)

(XDebug output)

Version is Trunk rev 15991

Edit: I have to say, that in branch 1.8.3 all is fine :)

This is no bug.

When you name your file is a way where the same token is used for two languages, then the result is not defined.

file.de.mo -> there are the languages german and moldavian integrated. If you get german or moldavian depends on several things like php version, os and so on. It's unexpected !!!

When you use a different token, like described in the manual things work like expected.

file-de.mo -> then your file will be recognised correct.
