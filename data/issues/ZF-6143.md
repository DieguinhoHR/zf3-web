### Description

Would be nice if e.g. Zend\_Dom\_Query::setDocument() or the Zend\_Dom\_Query::\_\_construct() would double-check if the supplied document is not only null, but also if it's empty. Should be two different things. An empty string is not null -- if you need to make sure, use empty() instead of !== null.

An idea:

I'm not exactly certain what problem this is solving? Is there a specific case in which this is really causing an issue? Also what you do need to think about is how empty() operates vs. doing a strlen which is also faster.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $str = 0;
    var_dump(empty($str)); // true
    where as:
    $str = 0;
    var_dump(strlen($str) === 0); // false

Added patch and test case. Did not change this to check for empty but did utilize strlen.
