### Description

Since ZF's MVC approach builds up HTML with HTML code being generated from just about anywhere, I was wondering if it were possible to auto-execute a XHTML validation at the end of every page rendered during development, and then throw Exceptions when certain fragments are not valid for the defined DTD.

This could be a great help to keep pages valid when working with a lot of HTML-snippets etc...

Not a framework concern. This could easily be implemented in userspace using a postDispatch hook from within a controller plugin.
