### Description

Zend\_Application::\_loadConfig detects content type based on extension. It looks for .yaml, but needs to also look for .yml, a common YAML extension.

current:

case 'yaml': $config = new Zend\_Config\_Yaml($file, $environment); break;

fix:

case 'yaml': case 'yml': $config = new Zend\_Config\_Yaml($file, $environment); break;
