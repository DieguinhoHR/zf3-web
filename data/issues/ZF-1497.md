### Description

The following doesn't work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Session::start();
    Zend_Session::destroy();
    Zend_Session::start();


It never writes any session data, because the second start() command is silently ignored.

Here is a patch which fixes the problem:

John, I dont follow what the use case is here.

Start Destroy Start..

All within a single request, aside from making it "possible", I am interested in the Use case you present for applications to do this.

The idea here probably was that I wanted to start from scratch with a new session every time that particular controller was called, although I'm pretty sure the code itself has changed to the point where that use-case has disappeared.

Regardless, nothing should just be silently ignored -- it should either tell me I'm using the API incorrectly or do what I ask it to.

Added a check in Zend\_Session::start() to throw an exception if destroy was called before start().

In r8010.

My requirement is, When user agent change session should destroy, and it should start new session. But Zend\_Session::start() is throwing an exception if destroy was called before start().

 
    try { 
    Zend_Session::start();
     } catch (Zend_Session_Exception $e) {
     Zend_Session::destroy(true); 
    Zend_Session::start(); // breaking here 
    Zend_Session::regenerateId(); 
    }
    Zend_Session::registerValidator(new Zend_Session_Validator_HttpUserAgent());


I have a global session management in bootstrap, which validates the request and starts session. By that time, request won't be dispatched. Then why to make another request to redirect to another page? As we already knew that session is wrong one? we could easily start new one right?

_IMPORTANT!_ session\_destroy() will (by design) prevent any further session cookies to be sent. This means your use case _must be avoided_ if you are using cookies.

Here is more info in php manual comments: [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-destroy.php#85379)
