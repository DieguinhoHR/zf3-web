### Description

I'm trying to use web service form this WSDL: [https://ucsweb.dpd.com.pl/UnisoftCustomerServices/â€¦](https://ucsweb.dpd.com.pl/UnisoftCustomerServices/Parcel.asmx?WSDL). Unfortunately there is a problem with: "Unable to handle request without a valid action parameter. Please supply a valid soap action.". Is there solution in Zend Framework for this?

Could you supply more information, on exactly where the error comes from, and a simple script to reproduce the error.

If this is a support request, please use the fw-general mailing list, or #zftalk on freenode IRC.
