### Description

In the save method, if the backend returns a value positive you assume that the can be corrupted and you attempt to remove the given key in the cache, but this key can be changed by the save method ( to add prefix for example ) and it will be changed a seconde time in the remove method.

That's all

I use zf1.7 and zf1.9, this patch is made using the last zf version in the trunk but the problem affects all version from zf1.7 to the current.

Yes I have. And I have an email confirming me that the cla is processed and my jira account is added to the contributor group. But it's the first time I try to use the patch uploader so maybe I never have been in the contributor group.

Am I supposed to do anything else ?

The problem only was on removing an item on a failed save using the already updated cache id but calling remove method of core and not directly of backend.

fixed in r23670 (trunk) & r23671 (1.11 branch)
