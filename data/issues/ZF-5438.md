### Description

According to standard HTTP/1.1 all transfer-coding values are case insensitive ([http://w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/draft-lafon-rfc2616bis-03.html#transfer.codings)). But Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket doesn't understand "Chunked" with first uppercased letter.

In the class there is simple compare $headers['transfer-encoding'] == 'chunked' (in method read()) without any respect to case insensitivity.
