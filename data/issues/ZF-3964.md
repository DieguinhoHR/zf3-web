### Description

Here is what the docs for 1.5.3 say: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi addMultiOption (string $option, [string $value = ''])

 
    * string $option
    * string $value


But here is the code in the helper class:

 
        foreach ((array) $options as $opt_value => $opt_label) {


The key is the value and the value is the label, not like it's being added.
