### Description

Hello!

Currently it's possible to get the IMAP folder list and open a specified one to read its messages. It would be a nice feature to also be able to move messages from one IMAP folder to another.

Thanks!

It should be moved to Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap, which by the way has the following method:

null Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap::moveMessage(int $id, string|Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Folder $folder)
