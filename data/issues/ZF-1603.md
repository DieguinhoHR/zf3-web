ZF-1603: Zend\_Gdata\_App\_Util::formatTimestamp does not generate offset when converting from a Unix timestamp
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

_Summary:_ When formatTimestamp() is given an integer representing a Unix timestamp, the resulting RFC 3339 date string is generated without a timezone offset relative to the system timezone. This can lead to confusion since Unix timezones are always with respect to UTC+0.

To avoid this, times generated from a Unix timestamp should always be generated using UTC and the timezone should be explicitly stated. Unit tests should be updated accordingly.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r5036, affects 1.0.0 RC1 and 1.0.0 RC2.

_Notes:_ Issue fixed and unit tests updated in my build. Patch sent to rboyd for review.
