ZF-12389: isLast not working as expected in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb\_Page

### Description

The isLast method on Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb\_Page-objects checks wether the NextToken is null or not, when determining wether or not it is the last page for the query.

However, the Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb sets the NextToken to an empty string, if there is no NextToken, so the isLast method doesn't work as intended.

As I see it could be fixed either in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb or Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_SimpleDb\_Page. I don't know which would be better for the framework.
