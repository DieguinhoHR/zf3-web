ZF-8532: Zend\_Filter::filterStatic() and autoload error
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I get fatal error "Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim" on this code:

Zend\_Filter::addDefaultNamespaces(array('MyNamespace')); Zend\_Filter::filterStatic(' foo ', 'StringTrim'));

I use autoloader in standard way:

require\_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php'; $loader = Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::getInstance();

There is some problem with custom namespace. It was solved by changing this code in Zend/Filter.php[172]:

if (!class\_exists($className)) {

to call with disabled autoload:

if (!class\_exists($className, false)) {

But I'm not sure if it is good solution.

Not an issue

Changing the component, so classes would no longer be loaded would not be a good idea.

The reason seems that you have declared the same classname within 2 different files. This, of course, throws an exception.

It is also to note that the code line you gave and the release you gave do not conform... line 172: $className = $namespace . '\_' . ucfirst($classBaseName); would NEVER throw an exception.

Feel free to reopen the issue when you have additional informations.
