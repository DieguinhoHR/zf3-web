### Description

The most part of unit test files requires TestCase.php and/or TestSuite.php files even if they have already been included by TestHelper.

These remnants should be removed.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))) . '/TestHelper.php';
    require_once "PHPUnit/Framework/TestCase.php";
    require_once "PHPUnit/Framework/TestSuite.php";


will become

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))) . '/TestHelper.php';

Patch attached which cleans this up.

Also attached the (.sh) script used to do this in case further modifications are necessary. To use the script, _run it from the /trunk/tests directory_.
