ZF-2987: Should register an error handler to convert errors into exception and avoid 'failed to parse response' message

### Description

This is a problem I noticed with the Zend Xmlrpc class: Very often it breaks on me and all I get is 'failed to parse response'... Tracing through the code, eventually I realized that something was raising an error, so I had to use ob\_start() and make it email me the buffer contents only to realize that mistakenly I tried to do this on the Zend\_Db object: $this->db->exec();

Instead of $result = $this->db->prepare($sql); $result->exec();

Which raised a fatal error, because that function did not exist.... Can't we add an error handler to the Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server?

Thanks!

Scheduling for next minor release. This sort of improvement should be made to all the \_Server classes.
