ZF-1464: findManyToManyRowset: rows behave as new records
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When using the findManyToManyRowset on Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row all the Rows returned are populated with data but not marked as stored. As a result when performing a save using $row->save() it tries to add a new record instead of updating the existing record.

Indeed, that's a good catch. Thanks for the patch.

I have applied the edit but before I commit it I will write unit tests to make sure that rows acquired from a many-to-many query can be updated and saved correctly.

Fixed in revision 5076. New unit tests should ensure this stays fixed.
