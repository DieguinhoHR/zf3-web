ZF-1227: Mistake into phpdoc of Zend\_XmlRpcServer

### Description

Into the example:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    // Attach Another_Service_Class in 'another' namespace; use only static
    // methods
    $server->setClass('Another_Service_Class', 'another', false);


When read this comment i think that false argument is for use only statics methods.

But into setClass method documentation: Any additional arguments beyond $namespace will be passed to a method at invocation.

Updated the class-level docblock in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server to remove obsolete usage.
