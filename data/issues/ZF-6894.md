ZF-6894: Incompatibile Zend\_Db::delete() behavior when string array key is used in where condition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

There is an unexpected behavior / critical incompatibility using delete method of Zend\_Db. When parameter $where is an array('article\_id' => 'article\_id=123') whole table is emptied instead of deleting a single record with an article\_id=123.

Example:

$where = array('article\_id' => 'article\_id=123'); $this->db->delete('MY\_TABLE', $where);

ZF 1.7.8: row with article\_id=123 is deleted ZF 1.8.2: result: MY\_TABLE is emptied

The behavior is caused by the 'string' array key. If numeric key is used the problem is avoid.

In Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 659 you can see this: $term = $this->quoteInto($cond, $term);

Using array('article\_id' => 'article\_id=123') will cause a where query like "WHERE article\_id" without any binding. The correct array binding should be array('article\_id = ?' => 123).

In my opinion, if the ZF developer team changes this behavior in order to preverse BC, it will introduce unpredictable results.

Closing as not an issue, as noted above, the correct and documented notation would be array('field = ?' => $value)
