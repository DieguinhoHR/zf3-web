ZF-6794: Constant ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN is used case-sensitive in method setRowCount().

### Description

The method setRowCount() of class Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect creates an SQL query to retrieve the number of rows of a selection. It does so, by trying to recieve an element of the resultset via the constant ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN. This value is in our Zend\_Framework application returned in UPPERCASE. This we control via de ini-file line:

resources.db.params.options.caseFolding = 1

However the constant is in LOWERCASE, while this really can vary per application. I solved this in our case by temporarily changing the value of the constant in uppercase. But my suggestion would be to not address the result value by name, but by retrieving the first column by number, somewhat like $this->\_rowcount=$result[0] in stead of $result[self::ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN]

Could you provide a more detailed use-case on how this would be a problem? Some queries and (where available) error messages would be very useful. The constant should only be used internally in Zend\_Paginator and work regardless of the caseFolding setting.

Cheers,
