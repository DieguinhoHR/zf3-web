ZF-635: Zend\_Db\_Select getter methods to return individual parts

### Description

Currently, the select component only accepts arguments to store for statement composition later:

$select->from( ... ) $select->where( ... ) $select->join( ... ) $sql = $select->\_\_toString()

It would be very useful for the select component to return the invidual parts as return values if invoked with NO arguments. In other words, the following behavior - after the above function calls:

$from = $select->from(); eg: SELECT id, name FROM user ...

$where = $select->where(); eg: WHERE id = 1 AND ...

$join = $select->join(); eg: JOIN admin a ON u.id = a.id ...

Here are some other methods:

$select->orWhere(); $select->group(); $select->having(); $select->limit(); $select->limitPage(); $select->order();

Thoughts...?

We merge/consolidate from, join and where clauses dynamically based on some conditions. Even if these methods return the previously set values as-is (eg: arrays), that would reduce a large chunk of code in our application. As it is, these methods in the select component function as set-methods while the get methods are missing and I thought we could toggle their functionality to return the originally set values if the arguments passed while invoking them were empty.

I see these methods return $this for fluent interfaces. I guess providing get\*() methods to return arrays (by reference) would leave their functionality intact. We particularly need access to where, from and join clauses so a single/universal method - getPart( $part ) should do the trick. Eg:

$where =& $select->getPart( 'where' )

TIA

Assigning to Bill Karwin. Scheduling for 0.8.

I would choose to implement get\* methods so that the fluent interface is not spoiled. I would make a separate method for each part, instead of the getPart() method. This would be friendlier to code-completion tools.

Recategorize in Zend\_Db\_Select component.

Implemented in revision 3320.

The method is called getPart(). You pass a string to name the part you want to get.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->getPart( 'where' );


You can also use constants that are defined for this purpose in Zend\_Db\_Select:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->getPart( Zend_Db_Select::WHERE );

Very neat implementation, indeed!

Thanks, much!

Just a couple of things:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    - public function getPart($part)
    + public function &getPart($part)         // Returns part by reference instead of as a copy to conserve memory
    
    
       public function reset($part = null)
        {
            if ($part == null) {
    -            $this->_parts = $this->_partsInit;
    +            $this->_parts = self::$_partsInit;
            } else if (array_key_exists($part, $this->_partsInit)) {
    -            $this->_parts[$part] = $this->_partsInit[$part];
    +           $this->_parts[$part] = self::$_partsInit[$part];
            }
        } 


I noticed the new code is adding aliases to the column names which is bombing in certain cases:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( 'user', 'Count(*)' );
    $select->where( 'ID = ?', $id );
    echo $select->__toString();
    
    Output:
    
    SELECT  user_1.Count(*)
    FROM user user_1
    WHERE
        ID = 1


The above statement is not a valid SQL statement. I guess we need to either remove the aliasing logic or provide an additional argument (default true) to prefix aliases or not.

Thanks, I have fixed it in revision 3323.

See ZF-204 for the table aliases issue. If you pass '' as the table name you can add expressions that will not be prepended with table names.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( '', 'count(*)' );


This isn't the final solution that I would propose. But it does work for now.

I'll write a new proposal soon, but to give a preview of the use case I have in mind:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from( array('*', new Zend_Db_Expr('count(*)' )) );


Thus the 'count( \* )' is an object of a particular class, not a plain string. Zend\_Db\_Select can use 'instanceof' and thus will know not to treat it as it would do for column names. This can also help for insert(), update(), delete(), quoteInto(), etc.
