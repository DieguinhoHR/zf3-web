### Description

Let's supposed we want to add a custom element into a form generated by a config element.

action = "#" method = "post"

; name this dhould be under normal Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text elements.name.type = "text" elements.name.options.required = true elements.name.options.label = "name"

; up this dhould be running as Imagis\_Form\_Element\_File prefixPath.element.prefix = "Imagis\_Form\_Element" prefixPath.element.path = "Imagis/Form/Element/" elements.up.type = "file" elements.up.options.label = "Up"

; submit element this dhould be under normal Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit elements.submit.type = "submit" elements.submit.options.value = "submit"

Problem is 'up' element is rendered as a text element not a Imagis\_Form\_Element\_File (which us actually an upload element).

I think was my own fault.

Into new class i added the new element as:

public $defaulthelper = 'formFile';

instead of

public $helper = 'formFile';

Somewhere on other ZF files was defaulthelper...
