### Description

Since version 1.7.0 I get the error on row 772 of Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php. When debugging I see that the array\_intersect parameters can never get a positive result:

$cols is an array with the following content:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [account_id] => Array
            (
                [SCHEMA_NAME] => 
                [TABLE_NAME] => account
                [COLUMN_NAME] => account_id
                [COLUMN_POSITION] => 1
                [DATA_TYPE] => bigint
                [DEFAULT] => 
                [NULLABLE] => 
                [LENGTH] => 
                [SCALE] => 
                [PRECISION] => 
                [UNSIGNED] => 1
                [PRIMARY] => 1
                [PRIMARY_POSITION] => 1
                [IDENTITY] => 1
            )
    
        [accounttype_id] => Array
            (
                [SCHEMA_NAME] => 
                [TABLE_NAME] => account
                [COLUMN_NAME] => accounttype_id
                [COLUMN_POSITION] => 2
                [DATA_TYPE] => bigint
                [DEFAULT] => 1
                [NULLABLE] => 
                [LENGTH] => 
                [SCALE] => 
                [PRECISION] => 
                [UNSIGNED] => 
                [PRIMARY] => 
                [PRIMARY_POSITION] => 
                [IDENTITY] => 
            )
           ....


$this->\_primary contains an array with the following content:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [1] => account_id
    )


Can somebody please confirm this is a bug?

I've created a workaround for this issue:

monospaced } else if (isset($this->\_primary[0])) { array\_unshift($this->\_primary, null); unset($this->\_primary[0]); }

 
        $cols = $this->_getCols();
    
        foreach( (array) $this->_primary as $column ) {
            if( ! array_key_exists( $column, $cols ) ) {
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Table_Exception("Primary key column(s) ("
                    . implode(',', (array) $this->_primary)
                    . ") are not columns in this table ("
                    . implode(',', $cols)
                    . ")");
            }
        }
    
        $primary    = (array) $this->_primary;
        $pkIdentity = $primary[(int) $this->_identity];

After more debugging I found out that this was not in issue in the Framework, but in my own code. Unfortunatly, I can not find an option to close this issue myself.
