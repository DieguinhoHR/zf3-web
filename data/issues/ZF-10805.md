ZF-10805: method docblocks contain invalid @param syntax

### Description

According to [phpDocumentor](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLframesConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.param.pkg.html), the correct format of @param is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    @param datatype $paramname description


There are some instances in the codebase where the datatype is omitted or the terms are out of order (i.e. @param $foo string)

For example, run this in the library dir:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    find . -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 grep -P '@param[ ]+\$'


The main side effect is that IDEs are generally be unable to do correct code completion/hinting for these methods.
