### Description

As explained in [that issue](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1745) when setting fetch mode of DB adapter (PDO MySQL) to Objects using setFetchMode(Zend\_Db::FETCH\_OBJ), the fetchAssoc() still returns an associative array of objects and not associative array of arrays.

I haven't tested this with other adapters as I'm not able too so this may occur with other adapters too.

This may be important to easily correct the problem in Zend Auth issued.
