ZF-9665: SubForms Produce Conflicting Markup for Element with Same Name in Main Form
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Sub-task Created: 2010-04-12T16:23:47.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-20T11:52:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The following code:

$form = new Zend\_Form; $form->addElement('text', 'foo'); $subForm = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm; $subForm->addElement('text', 'foo'); $form->addSubForm($subForm, 'mySubForm'); echo $form;

Renders as:

        Please note the ids for the main form's 'foo' and for the sub form's 'foo'. I would have expected 'mySubForm-foo-label' and 'mySubForm-foo-element', but the standard decorators do not seem to do this.
