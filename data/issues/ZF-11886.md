### Description

I suggest on Zend\_Form\_Element a removeDecorators(array), actually we just have removeDecorator(string), if i want to remove more than one i have to recall the function few times.

Wouldn't it just make sense to use setDecorators at that point. This would probably just complicate things. Especially how would you remove particular decorators that cannot be referred to by their decorator name, (since they have been used twice).

a decorator can be always referred by name, the question is in case i have for example 50 decorators, and i don't want 2 of those, instead make a setDecorators() with a lot of params (or something like), i just remove those 2 with removeDecorators(array('foo', 'bar')).
