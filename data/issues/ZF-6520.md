My bad -- I should have added this as an incubator project. Unfortunately, as there are now issues attached to the component, I cannot delete it, as it deletes the issues attached to it.

As it stands, I think separating by incubator and trunk within the issue tracker is a bad idea, as we cannot migrate issues between them, nor effectively link trunk issues with incubator issues.
