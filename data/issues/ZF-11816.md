### Description

Hello,

I write an underclass of Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle to get wrong or slow queries (because the profile only report good queries). It works almost fine except for fetch() method that I can not get binded params.

The issue is on Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle::\_execute() that directly calls oci\_bind\_by\_name() (@line 243) instead of bindParam() (and not \_bindParam(), because I wouldn't get Zend\_Db\_Statement::$\_bindParam attribute populated.

Here is the proposed patch on Zend/Db/Statement/Oracle.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    243c243
    <                 if (!@oci_bind_by_name($this->_stmt, $name, $params[$name], -1)) {
    ---
    >                 if (!$this->bindParam($name, $params[$name], null, -1)) {


Thx for your help and support, Wilfried

Still no activity on this issue ? While this is a very minor code improvement, it would really help me on my Oracle tracing...

Thanks a lot for your help & support, Wilfried

Waiting to hear from component lead on whether or not there is a specific known reason why the oci method was used directly
