### Description

Hi there,

It would be nice if the fromString() and asString() methods were symmetrical, so that a response serialized a string could be expected to unserialize correctly (and that the string-representation of the response itself is valid).

The problem is simply that asString() returns the decoded body - however the headers may still indicate content chunking or compression - so that when the text is fed back to fromString(), it expects the body to be chunked or compressed.

The fix is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    --- Response.php    (revision 3800)
    +++ Response.php    (working copy)
    @@ -394,7 +394,7 @@
          */
         public function asString($br = "\n")
         {
    -        return $this->getHeadersAsString(true, $br) . $br . $this->getBody();
    +        return $this->getHeadersAsString(true, $br) . $br . $this->getRawBody();
         }
     
         /**


Would be nice if there was another method that did this, or an optional argument, if you don't want to change asString() for backwards compat reasons.

Thanks, Keith
