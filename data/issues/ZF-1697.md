### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Table documentation doesn't currently have any example code that shows how to pass the where clause to the fetchAll() command as an associative array. e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rows = $table->fetchAll(array('bug_status = ?' => 'NEW'));


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $where = array('bug_status = ?' => 'NEW', 'reported_by = ?' => 'talawahdotnet');
    $rows = $table->fetchAll($where);


This syntax is very useful because quoting is automatically applied and multiple conditions are automatically ANDed together.

This usage would look even cleaner if the improved array syntax were introduced into PHP: <http://marc.info/?l=php-dev&m=117057393530217>
