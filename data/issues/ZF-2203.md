### Description

Technorati provides an DTD for XML API responses. Any response object class should be compared with [XML DTD](http://api.technorati.com/dtd/tapi-002.xml) to include all available properties.

Be aware that some test cases underlined how sometimes Technorati doesn't take care of its DTD. For instance, this is an author node from tag response.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    jmiguelusChismes atrevidos y escándalos de la farándula mundial.<a href="http://static.technorati.com/progimages/photo.jpg?uid=794083">http://static.technorati.com/progimages/photo.jpg/…</a>

However, author node should match the following declaration.

 
    <pre class="highlight">

This request is not applicable because Technorati seems to ignore its own DTD too many times. Actually the best way to discover attribute formats is to rely on test cases.
