ZF-11528: AMF server should always authenticate if credentials are provided

### Description

Currently, if no ACLs are provided to Zend\_Amf\_Server, but an authentication adapter _is_ provided, it will only attempt to authenticate if credentials are provided in the reqeust. In most cases, authentication should happen no matter what if an authentication adapter is provided, and raise an exception if invalid credentials are provided.

Additionally, this behavior should be configurable; there may be cases where this is undesired.

Actually, this is tricky. Currently, we assume that there may be multiple request bodies in a given request. We loop through them, and the first one that has an credentials we pass to our authentication handler, using that result for all following request bodies (regardless of whether or not they pass credentials). Clearly, if an ACL is in place and the user is not allowed to perform a given action, the loop ends early -- but if no ACL is in place, authentication has no special purpose.

Perhaps we should instead provide an example of anonymous -> denied access + credentialed -> enabled?

What I do see is some inefficiency in \_handle() surrounding when authentication takes place. Currently it happens inside a loop, but uses headers available without needing to be in the loop scope. Additionally, the authentication check should happen (a) if there are appropriate credential headers, and (b) a registered authentication object, in that order.

\_handle() has been refactored in trunk; waiting on a documentation update from Kevin in order to close out this issue.
