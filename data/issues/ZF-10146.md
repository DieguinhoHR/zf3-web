### Description

When using a navigation xml config file the visible-option is not working as expected as it is not accepting booleans (true/false) as values. This is accepted:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 


This is ignored:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
     false

"false" value is accepted in array configs to this is a little bit confusing and I do not see a reason for forcing integer values as it is actually a flag.

A possible quick fix would be in Zend/Navigation/Page.php on line 731:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    and changing it to:


but I am not sure if this is the right place to fix this. The problem here is that the string "false" is casted to boolean true.

Hello Micha, {quote} and changing it to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    {quote}
    Bad idea:


true

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    becomes


false

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    My proposal for this problem:


public function setVisible($visible = true) { if ('false' === strtolower($visible)) { $visible = false; }

 
    $this->_visible = (bool) $visible;
    return $this;


} ``` ??but I am not sure if this is the right place to fix this.?? The documentation says: {quote} Note: Return Type Configuration data read into Zend\_Config\_Xml are always returned as strings. Conversion of data from strings to other types is left to developers to suit their particular needs. {quote} [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.adapters.xml.html)]
