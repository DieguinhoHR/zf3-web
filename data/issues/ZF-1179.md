ZF-1179: Posting an entry to Blogger

### Description

The 'post' function of the Zend\_Gdata\_Blogger class sets a 'wrong' standard URI

Standard Zend\_Gdata\_Blogger post URI : $uri = "http://[www.blogger.com/feeds/{$this](www.blogger.com/feeds/%7B$this)->blogName}/posts/default";

At the moment Blogger is using (updated URI) : $uri = "http://{$this->blogName}.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default";

Although the getBloggerFeed-function already has the right URI ! ($uri = "http://{$this->blogName}.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"; )

Maybe it's better to leave out the standard URI (cause Blogger is changing a lot) and hold the documentation up to date with the last Blogger URI. This way you force the developers to use the correct URI... This is a minor issue which brings a lot of confusing while testing/using the Zend\_Gdata\_Blogger class.

Assigning to Ryan.

The refactoring of the PHP client library with ZF 1.0 removed the need for a Blogger-specific class, and thus there's no longer a URL specified in the code.

Google has published a guide specifying how to work with Blogger using the newly-refactored client library: [http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/…](http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/developers_guide_php.html)

In addition to the developer guide, there's also some sample code available at: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/demos/Zend/Gdata/Blogger.php)

Please follow up on this bug if you have any questions.

Thanks, -Ryan
