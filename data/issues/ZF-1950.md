### Description

I find following sentence in line 515 in Zend/Mail.php.

$this->\_storeHeader('From', $this->\_encodeHeader('"'.$name.'"').' <'.$email.'>', true);

But it causes error if Sender name contains Multibyte characters and Receiver uses OutlookExpress. For example , I look in the $this , =?ISO-2022-JP?Q?"=1B$BAw=3F.<T=1B(B"?=. I think it must be "=?ISO-2022-JP?Q?=1B$BAw=3F.<T=1B(B?=".

I propose to modify the line as next. $this->\_storeHeader('From', '"'.$this->\_encodeHeader($name).'"<'.$email.'>', true);

I hope it will useful.

Postponed because encoding will (most likely) be changed to iconv\_mime\_encode(), which should also fix this issue.
