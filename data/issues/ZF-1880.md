### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory(
            'Mysqli',
            array(
                'host'     => 'xxx',
                'username' => 'xxx',
                'password' => 'xxx',
                'dbname'   => 'xxx'
            )
    );
    ...
    
    $query = "INSERT INTO foo VALUES('foo','bar')";
    try {
        $db->query($query);
    }
    catch (Zend_Db_Exception $e) {
        if (!strstr($e->getMessage(), 'Duplicate')) {
            throw $e;
         }
    }


The complete error message is: Mysqli statement execute error : Duplicate entry '...' for key 1

As you can see I have to strstr() on the message to find the error, I think it would be a huge improvement if the exception returned a code as well - right now it returns "0", which is a bit too generic IMO. This is probably not the only case (query, adapter) where this happens.

I just svn up'ed before I created this issue and it's still in there.
