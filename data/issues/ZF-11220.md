### Description

I followed this procedure in order to have locale routes.

My routes are supposed to look like this:

/:lang/:controller/:action/:var/:val/:var/:val

For some reason (don't ask why), I found out that when I use a URL like this: /en//ab//cd

The parameters looks like this (output of getParams):

string(7) "default" array(5) { [""]=> array(2) { [0]=> string(2) "ab" [1]=> string(2) "cd" } ["controller"]=> string(5) "index" ["action"]=> string(5) "index" ["module"]=> string(7) "default" ["lang"]=> string(2) "en"}

It appears that the router takes // as parameter name or, an empty string, and uses the following: module: default controller: index action: index

But when I use a URL like /en/ab/cd

The parameters look like this:

string(7) "default" array(5) { ["controller"]=> string(2) "ab" ["action"]=> string(2) "cd" ["module"]=> string(7) "default" ["lang"]=> string(2) "en"

What I expected was that in the first URL (/en//ab//cd), the detected controller would be "" and action would be "" as well. And that they would not be taken as parameter.

I think a solution might be to remove the && !empty($path[0]) on line 169 and 173 from the Module class. But I didn't test this.

I hope someone could have a look at it, and confirm it's a bug or not.
