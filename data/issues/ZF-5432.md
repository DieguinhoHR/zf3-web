ZF-5432: February 29, 2009 does not validate and thows an error

### Description

I have a form that has a date field. When typing in 02/29/2009 and clicking submit, I get the message:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Validate\_Date::\_century() in /.../lib/Zend/Validate/Date.php on line 200

I expected to get a validation message saying that the date was not a valid date.

After opening Zend\_Version.php I see that we are using version 1.6.0RC2, so maybe this issue has already been resolved.
