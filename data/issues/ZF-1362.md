### Description

The CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG isn working as required. If CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG is used with an array of tags the tags must match the given cache tags or the file will not be removed.

$cache->save('DATA1', 'CACHEID1', array('tagA')); $cache->save('DATA2', 'CACHEID2', array('tagB', 'tagA')); $cache->save('DATA3', 'CACHEID3', array('tagC', 'tagB')); $cache->save('DATA4', 'CACHEID4', array('tagD'));

$cache->clean(Zend\_Cache::CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG, array('tagA', 'tagB'));

this happens in in a just removed entry DATA2. But i should normally remove all entries with tagA and all with tagB or do i something missing? Or is it required to recall for every tag?

it's completly normal ; when used with an array of tags CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG does a logical AND between tags

if you want to drop cache entries with tagA OR tagB, just use :

$cache->clean(Zend\_Cache::CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG, array('tagA')); $cache->clean(Zend\_Cache::CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG, array('tagB'));

Ah ok, this makes more sense if i think more than just 2 sec about this. But to drop useless stat calls to filesystem it would be cool to have an additional cleaning mode where i can define Tags that should match without any AND logical.

New CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_ANY\_TAG would be perfect in this situation.
