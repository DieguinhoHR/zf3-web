### Description

The current way of adding references to a ZDTA subclass is by providing an array. This is a very verbose and non-intuitive way of setting up the relation, which forces the developer to remember array keys that are actually only interesting for the ZDTA class. I want to suggest adding a method to add a relation to the ZDT instance, which will make the process more intuitive and less error-prone.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Add a reference to the reference map
         *
         * @param string $ruleKey
         * @param string|array $columns
         * @param string $refTableClass
         * @param string|array $refColumns
         * @param string $onDelete
         * @param string $onUpdate
         * @return Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
         */
        public function addReference($ruleKey, $columns, $refTableClass, $refColumns, $onDelete = null, $onUpdate = null)
        {
            $reference = array(self::COLUMNS         => $columns,
                               self::REF_TABLE_CLASS => $refTableClass,
                               self::REF_COLUMNS     => $refColumns);
    
            if (!empty($onDelete)) {
                $reference[self::ON_DELETE] = $onDelete;
            }
    
            if (!empty($onUpdate)) {
                $reference[self::ON_UPDATE] = $onUpdate;
            }
    
            $this->_referenceMap[$ruleKey] = $reference;
    
            return $this;
        }

Updated code to use the class constants.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
