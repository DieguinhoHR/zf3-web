### Description

While trying to setup DisplayGroups in an xml configuration file (ordered by tag name) I discovered, that because I defined it above the elements-tag it wouldn't work. Would be nice if Zend\_Form could handle the options in an appropriate order.

XML-File:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    textElementName1Label 1
                        textElementName2Label 2
                        textElementName3Label 3
                        textElementName4Label 4
                        Form 1
                postElementName1ElementName2loginTest
                            Form 1
                        FieldsetFieldsetElementName1ElementName2loginTest
                            Form 1
                        textElementName1Label 1
                        textElementName2Label 2
                        textElementName3Label 3
                        textElementName4Label 4
                        Form 1
                post

Controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> $config = new Zend_Config_Xml(BASE_PATH . 'application/modules/ecrf/config/test.xml', 'sitearea', true);
            
    $form = new Zend_Form($config->test);
    $form2 = new Zend_Form($config->test2);
            
    $this->view->form = $form;
    $this->view->form2 = $form2;


If you look at the xml file you'll notice that and have the same options. works fine but doesn't work because of the different order. The error that occures starts with: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Form\_Exception' with message 'No valid elements specified for display group' in D:\\xampp\\htdocs\\projekte\\zend\\library\\Zend\\Form.php:1439 ...

Hope, you can now reproduce it. The snapshot used is ZendFramework-20080501-9348-en

PS: Wasn't able to reopen the previous issue (<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3112>) but added the example there too.

Zend\_Form::setOptions() is missing a condition to define display groups after other processing is finished.

Actually, there is no issue with Zend\_Form; the issue is with the configuration presented, and there are two errors:

- Configuration keys should start with lowercase letters. If they do not, the checks done in Zend\_Form to allow forcing of pre/post-posting fail. Examples of bad configuration keys above are: \*\* DefaultDisplayGroupClass \*\* DisplayGroups \*\* Elements
- Your usage of DefaultDisplayGroupClass is problematic regardless. This key should be used to specify a single class name to use when instantiating display groups. From your usage, it appears you probably want the key 'displayGroupDecorators' instead. Even so, this would not work as it does not contain the 'FormElements' decorator, which means that you would have an empty fieldset for each display group.

Below is a revised version of the XML configuration that works properly:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    FormElementsFieldsetElementName1ElementName2loginTest
                            Form 1
                        textElementName1Label 1
                        textElementName2Label 2
                        textElementName3Label 3
                        textElementName4Label 4
                        Form 1
                post

I've added a test for this issue, but am closing it as 'Not an Issue'.
