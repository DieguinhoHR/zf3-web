### Description

I have followed the steps given in the Quick start guide. When I run the "zf.bat create project quickstart" command I get the following error

PHP Fatal error: Cannot access self:: when no class scope is active in C:\\php\\ZendFramework-1.10.6\\library\\Zend\\Tool\\Framework\\Provider\\Signature.php on line 355

Cannot seem to reproduce this in 1.11. If it still exists. We can reopen, but this line does not currently reference self.
