ZF-5350: Zend\_Cache Frontend\_Page problem when generates a cache-id 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If array $\_COOKIE has values and set cache\_with\_cookie\_variables = false never generates a cache-id

In function \_makePartialId "count($var)" is > 0 even if cache\_with\_cookie\_variables = false and then makePartialId returns always false

When setting cache\_with\_cookie\_variables = true, it works correctly

for me, it works as expected :

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
         *     - (boolean) cacheWithXXXVariables  (XXXX = 'Get', 'Post', 'Session', 'Files' or 'Cookie') :
         *       if true,  cache is still on even if there are some variables in this superglobal array
         *       if false, cache is off if there are some variables in this superglobal array


so, if cache\_with\_cookie\_variables=false and if there are some values in the $\_COOKIE array, cache is off

Sorry to bump this up, but:

When using sessions, then a session cookie is set. Of course the code still works as expected i.e. no cache-id will be generated. However, as a default, a cookie with PHPSESSID is generated. As a result, with standard variables for "cache\_with\_cookie\_variables" and "make\_id\_with\_cookie\_variables", the cache-id will not be generated. This may be correct, but undesired. Perhaps PHPSESSID should be stripped from the $\_COOKIES superglobal. If not, only people who visit a certain page for the first time (= without session-id) will generate a cache for a specific page.
