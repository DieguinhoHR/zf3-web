### Description

<http://www.php.net/date>

How many of you have memorized and/or prefer the ZF to be consistent with the format characters used with PHP's date() function?

Specifically, the CLDR data set uses 'm' inconsistently with PHP and GNU's "date" program, where 'm' means "month". In CLDR and ZF i18n components, the CLDR meaning was preserved (i.e. 'm' for minute, instead of 'i').

I'm proposing the i18n components remain consistent with PHP for the format character 'm'.

h3. Edit: Summary: The ZF i18n components could support both ISO and PHP date() function date format specifier tokens when inputting and outputting custom formatted dates.

I think the i18n components are becoming a true gem in the Zend Framework. I realize this change is not simple and requires substantial effort, but the resulting flexibility justifies the effort. How many frameworks will have easy-to-use date format input/output specifiers using the developer's choice of either ISO/CLDR date format specifiers or PHP date()'s specifiers?

This flexibility is not two solutions to do the same thing. Instead, this flexibility allows for flexible input/output (import/export) of data in formats convenient to the developer, and possibly interoperating with existing code. We face some challenges to preserve the elegance and ease-of-use already in the i18n components, but I am confident we will succeed in offering developer specified input/output date formats using PHP's date() format specifiers, without limiting or restricting existing functionality.

{quote}How many of you have memorized and/or prefer the ZF to be consistent with the format characters used with PHP's date() function?{quote}

Non for now... Otherwise I would have been mailed or announced of that because this class is avaiable since several months. I know several people which are using this class and have from none of them heared that this is a problem.

{quote}Specifically, the CLDR data set uses 'm' inconsistently with PHP and GNU's "date" program, where 'm' means "month". In CLDR and ZF i18n components, the CLDR meaning was preserved (i.e. 'm' for minute, instead of 'i').{quote}

CLDR and ZF are not using 'm' inconsistently, they are using the ISO Standard 8601 where this notation is defined.

The complete framework is build upon the ISO standard and the CLDR. See here for details: ISO - [http://iso.org/iso/en/…](http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/datesandtime.html) CLDR - [http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/…](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Format_Patterns)

If someone is in need of php's date notation he should use Zend\_Date->date(); where the format letters are the same as within php itself.

The date functions from php are included so if someone is in need of the "old" php behaviour he is expected to use the related functions Zend\_Date->date() Zend\_Date->mktime().

For myself as non native english the ISO standard is more native than the old php notation. Also in my opinion the old php format letters are much overloaded and unlogic...

j for month day n for month number F for month string l (small L) for day of week and so on...

The ISO notation is much more native. MM - month number, 2 digits MMMM - full month string and so on...

My opinion is that having the ISO standard integrated is no problem because it is very simple. You will know them once u read the docu or api doc. And if you are in need of the php behaviour (linux properitary format) you can use ->date() also.

The PHP strftime() function wraps the underlying C function strftime(), which is usually based on:

[http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/…](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strftime.html) [http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/…](http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html)

Thus, the strftime() function intentionally does not mimick the "normal" date format specifiers elsewhere in PHP. The ZF devteam was unanimous in wanting public methods in the ZF to follow the date format specifiers already used in PHP's date() function, when reasonable and possible. When no conflict exists, I don't see a problem with augmenting PHP's date() function with additional specifiers supported by CLDR/ISO standards.

Primarily, the decision to remain consistent with PHP's date() function results from the ZF's goal of simplicity and avoiding unecessary learning curves for those already familiar with PHP, when possible.

The "normal" date function from php are only unproblematic for people which are using gnu/linux... all others would have a greater learning curve for php's format.

PHP's date format uses 32 formating letters The ISO format uses only 20 formatting letters and can do much more.

We would have problems for example with the following formating letters:

 
       ISO                     PHP's Date                                   Differences by same format letters


G - Era, abbreviated | 24h without zero | AD -> 06 GGGG - Era, complete | gives 4 times the 24h format | Anno Domini -> 06060606 y - year, 1-4 digit | year, 2 digit | 2007 -> 07 yyyy - year, 4 digit | 4 times 2 digit year | 2007 -> 07070707 Y - ISO Year, 1-4 digit | 4 digit year | 2008 -> 2007 YYYY - ISO Year, 4 digit | 4 times 4 digit year | 2008 -> 2007200720072007 M - Month, 1-2 digit | Month, 3 letters only english | 3 -> Mar MM - Month, 2 digit | 2 times 3 lettered english month | 03 -> MarMar MMM - Monthname short | 3 times 3 lettered english month | Mär -> MarMarMar MMMM - Monthname full | 4 times 3 lettered english month | März -> MarMarMarMar w - week of year,1-2 digit| day of week 0-6 | 5 -> 2 W - week of month | week of year | 3 -> 05 d - day of month,1-2digit | day of month 2 digit | 9 -> 09 dd - day of month, 2 digit | 2 times 2 digit day of month | 09 -> 0909 D - day of year,1 digit | day of week, 3 letters only english | 70 -> Tue DDD - day of year,3 digit | 3 times 3 lettered english day of week | 070 -> TueTueTue h - hour 1-12, 1-2 digit | hour 01-12, 2 digit | 6 -> 06 hh - hour 1-12, 2 digit | 2 times 2 digit hour 01-12 | 06 -> 0606 H - hour 0-23, 1 digit | hour 0-23, 2 digit | 4 -> 04 HH - hour 0-23, 2 digit | 2 times 2 digit 0-23 | 04 -> 0404 m - minute, 1-2 digit | month, 2 digit | 9 -> 09 mm - minute, 2 digit | 2 times 2 digit month | 09 -> 0909 s - second, 1-2 digit | second, 2 digit | 6 -> 06 ss - second, 2 digit | 2 times 2 digit second | 06 -> 0606 S - fractional second | day attachment sign for english days | 1425 -> st z - short timezone name | day of year | PDT -> 070 Z - GMT offset in hours | GMT offset in seconds | 100 -> 3600 ZZZZ - GMT offset, 4 digit | 4 times GMT offset | GMT+01:00 -> 3600360036003600

Also keep in mind that the standard formats from CLDR which are used for DATES, DATE\_FULL, TIME\_FULL and so on for all languages are defined with ISO and not PHP date format.

In my eyes this change would be very problematic with only very small benefit for a small amount of users. I would vote for the 90/10 rule and let things as they are.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-02-15T18:58:33.000+0000

Consistency and completeness are not the same. I think consistency is sufficient. Consistency can be achieved without implementing all of PHP date()'s format specifiers. Further, supporting non-conflicting format specifiers (e.g. MMMM) from CLDR do not seem to pose a problem, in my opinion.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-02-16T02:05:05.000+0000

We would have to throw away the implemented ISO standard, create a new non-standard which handles both by creating new letters. And we would have to write an parser which would have to change ISO to php date()...

I see big problems on this... although it is nonsense in my eyes... Zend Date works completly another way than php's date function. The implemented CLDR uses ISO format for all date and time issues.

If someone does not want to use Zend Date he should use php's internal date functions... Also the Gnu format is not locale aware. All name outputs are strict english.

Having both format's thrown into one format makes handling very problematic.

Example for some month letters : M - 3 lettered english monthname MM - 2 digit monthnumber MMM - 3 lettered localized monthname MMMM - full localized monthname m - 2 digit monthnumber mm - 2 digit minute

new letter for 1 digit monthname new letter for 1 digit minute

Such a new generated format is unlogic in it's handling... In my eyes this would complicate things and increases problems for users.

If devteam decides that we MUST support ye' old php date format because Zend Date would otherwise be useless, maybe it would be better to

1.) have an own parameter to switch from ISO to GNU format. 2.) have new functions which uses GNU format instead of ISO format (f.e. toPhpString) 3.) have an format-wrapper integrated (Zend\_Locale\_Format::toIsoFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s') --> "YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

As Zend Date is build upon Zend Locale/CLDR and CLDR uses ISO this would probably be the best way also to support gnu format if we have to do so.

But my opinion is, that maybe 2-5% of the ZF users would have problems with ISO format and use Gnu format. The people which I know to use Zend Date already since it is in incubator did not have any problems with ISO. But they were europeans and no americans :-)

I have a simpler solution planned that mostly avoids the issues you mentioned. I'm committing the patch very soon. I think the code will clarify things much more than words.

Basically, \_parseDate is changed slightly to become consistent with date(), without harming current operation. Then, toString() is renamed to toStringIso(), and I added toString() which wraps Zend\_Date\_DateObject's date().

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-02-16T08:21:59.000+0000

Please wait until the code freeze is lifted up or commit it to incubator...

Having non verified code integrated into core would be a great headache and very unprofessional in this stage of the framework.

We should not make the same mistakes as with 0.7 once again.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-02-16T08:34:41.000+0000

I agree. Bill asked me to make the changes Thursday and commit it Thursday, but the changes are large and complex. I have been working on the changes for many hours now .. since Thursday (hard drive crashing on community server, so I had to reconstruct some of my work). I see no way to make such large changes within one day, just before a release. Instead, I have committed some very tiny changes that are easy to verify. I will post a large patch to this issue for community review.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-02-16T08:58:01.000+0000

The patch involved fixing some other bugs discovered while making the requested changes.

TODO: Not all of the weekday name format specifiers support the $locale parameter yet in Zend\_Date\_DateObject's date() method.

 

 

Posted by Bill Karwin (bkarwin) on 2007-02-16T13:03:03.000+0000

In your patch, why does \_\_toString() call toStringIso()?

I thought that since the Date constructor and the Date\_Object::date() method uses the PHP-style format specifiers, shouldn't the default \_\_toString() method also use PHP-style formatting?

Also I'm looking at the patched example in the doc Zend\_Date-Overview.xml file. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the three calls. Are you saying the Feb 31 outputs March 3 no matter what input spec you use?

The patch is full of trivial differences related to removing ^M characters and reversing "public static" vs. "static public" function declarations. When you make patches for review, please do not mix functional changes with code style changes. It makes it very hard to see where the substantial changes are.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-02-16T13:49:32.000+0000

I see several great problems which makes me headache :

toString versus date
--------------------

All standard short functions produce ISO output. This is standard for complete Zend\_Date. get/getxxx does ISO output, only toString does not...

But \_\_toString which is called by f.e. print $date does ISO... In my eyes it would be better to have the new functionality also implemented with an new name.

toDate / toDateString / toPhpString / toGnuString .... whatever

This would be better comform to the existing API

Internal format changes
-----------------------

setTime no longer supports CLDR format f.e. setTime('10:20:30', 'HH:mm:ss'); no longer works

setDate no longer supports CLDR format setDate('10.Feb.2007, 'dd.MM.YYYY); no longer works

Zend\_Locale\_Format now failes on time formats because m is parsed as minute instead of month if not getDate is used but an self defined CLDR format or if the format is taken directly from CLDR.

Constant changes
----------------

Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_SHORT is no longer locale aware and does only output english, but Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY is Zend\_Date::MONTH\_NAME is no longer locale aware and does only output english Zend\_Date::MONTH\_NAME\_SHORT is no longer locale aware and does only output english

PHP date wrapper
----------------

Zend\_Date\_DateObject->date is no longer compatible to php's date function. Given Format letters produce non php conform output Possible internal use of gmt is deleted but could be needed by Zend\_Calendar or extending classes.

Principially date has to be a wrapper to php's date function to add 64bit timestamp awareness as mktime. This is now no longer given.

Possible problems with ARPA/RFCxxx/RSS/W3C functions due to changed date().

Conclusion
----------

Only having the patch I can not verify all exactly. But this change is not a bug fix, this is an complete API change. And the proposed changes are not "simple", they propose other problems.

It would be better and much simpler to have toDate is something where the outputformat is changed to ISO format. Also we "could" make date() public.

I would like to have things as they are...

For php date format add a new function toDate or make date public. This would be API conform and would not make the problems which I've seen by looking through the code snippets above.

The ISO Format is used within CLDR... also within Zend Date... please do not change this, backwards compatibility can be archived simper as by changing the format to a non standard.

{quote}In your patch, why does \_\_toString() call toStringIso()?{quote}

"It is worth noting that the \_\_toString method will only be called when it is directly combined with echo() or print()."

Also note that there are no arguments with this magic method, thus implying that reasonable defaults should be used. The existing behavior of toStringIso() is correct when no arguments are given. Thus, \_\_toString() and also toString() should both call toStringIso() when the developer has not explicitly provided a date output format string.

{quote}Also I'm looking at the patched example in the doc Zend\_Date-Overview.xml file. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the three calls. Are you saying the Feb 31 outputs March 3 no matter what input spec you use?{quote}

Yes, all three "input specs" should result in the same effect, since all three are sufficient to define a date format specification matching the input. However, there are numerous other "input specs" that would fail to match the date string in that example. However, after a little sleep and reading this again, I see it needs more explanation, and probably should be moved to an advanced section, since it highlights an advanced feature (wrapping dates forward when the days indicated exceeds the number of days in the month).

{quote}I thought that since the Date constructor and the Date\_Object::date() method uses the PHP-style format specifiers, shouldn't the default \_\_toString() method also use PHP-style formatting?{quote}

To clarify, there is no such thing as "PHP's standard date output format". Instead we are preserving the API used by PHP's date() allowing developers to explicitly choose custom date output formats using date format specifiers, as documented in PHP's date() function.

Currently, Zend\_Date has no notion of associating specific date formatting strings with individual objects, although this might make an interesting feature in a later release. If we do add this feature, then the developer would choose which standard they want to use (ISO or PHP's date()), and \_\_toString() should then use the appropriate output method - either toString() or toStringIso().

_I realize this change is not simple and requires substantial effort, but I think the i18n components are becoming a true gem in the Zend Framework._ How many frameworks will have easy-to-use date format input/output specifiers using the developer's choice (whichever standard they are familiar with)?

This flexibility is _not_ two solutions to do the same thing. Instead, this flexibility allows for flexible input/output (import/export) of data in formats convenient to the developer, and possibly existing code they already have.

{quote}All standard short functions produce ISO output.{quote}

The primary methods facing users will be Zend\_Date::toString() and Zend\_Locale\_Format::getDate(), which wraps \_parseDate() and also supports "new Zend\_Date($dateString, $format)".

{quote}All standard short functions produce ISO output. This is standard for complete Zend\_Date. get/getxxx does ISO output, only toString does not...{quote} The idea of "ISO output" is not relevant. We are discussing and working with format specifiers explicitly supplied by developers. The issue relates to supporting format specifiers following the ISO conventions in CLDR or PHP's date(). There is no "conflict" between the new toString() using PHP's date format specifiers and Zend\_Date::get() since the latter accepts Zend\_Date constants to choose date formats instead of using developer-supplied date format specifiers. I see no problems or conflicts between Zend\_Date::get() and the new Zend\_Date::toString().

{quote}setTime no longer supports CLDR format f.e. setTime('10:20:30', 'HH:mm:ss'); no longer works{quote}

Yes, and the unit tests do not test the above for these methods:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setTime($time, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function addTime($time, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function subTime($time, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function compareTime($time, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function setDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function addDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function subDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null)
        public function compareDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null)


Would you like to add unit tests for this?

In order to make these functions use date format specifiers consistent with PHP's date(), we could renamed them \*Iso(), and then replace the originals with ones using a date parsing function that complies with PHP's date() format specifiers. I think the patched version of Zend\_Locale\_Format::\_parseDate() handles 95% of the cases when users would want to provide a date using a format specifier consistent/compatible with PHP's date() function.

{quote}Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY\_SHORT is no longer locale aware and does only output english, but Zend\_Date::WEEKDAY is{quote}

No. Remember, all the unit tests work with the patch, except for the ones relating to the bug in ZF-926:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $d = new Zend_Date();
    echo "Today in de_AT is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_SHORT, 'de_AT'), "\n";
    echo "Today in en_US is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::WEEKDAY_SHORT, 'en_US'), "\n";
    
    Today in de_AT is: Fre
    Today in en_US is: Fri
    
    echo "Today in fr_CA is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::MONTH_NAME, 'fr_CA'), "\n";
    echo "Today in en_US is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::MONTH_NAME, 'en_US'), "\n";
    Today in de_AT is: fAcvrier
    Today in en_US is: February
    
    echo "Today in fr_CA is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::MONTH_NAME_SHORT, 'fr_CA'), "\n";
    echo "Today in en_US is: ", $d->get(Zend_Date::MONTH_NAME_SHORT, 'en_US'), "\n";
    Today in de_AT is: fAcvr.
    Today in en_US is: Feb


Regarding the constants below WEEKDAY\_SHORT in get(), I have not finished coding for those yet. After working all night until 7:30am, I finally fell asleep. I can finish converting the format specifiers in Zend\_Date\_DateObject::date() to complete the support for PHP's date() format specifiers within Zend\_Date. TODO: 'F', 'M', 'a', 'A', and 'e'.

{quote}Zend\_Date\_DateObject->date is no longer compatible to php's date function. Given Format letters produce non php conform output {quote} It never was compatible, but is "more" compatible now.  
 Would you be more specific?

{quote}Possible internal use of gmt is deleted but could be needed by Zend\_Calendar or extending classes.{quote}

Could you provide use cases to help justify the inclusion of code that is never used? If necessary, it can be added back later, as a trailing optional parameter. The patch makes it possible to add the $gmt flag at the end of the parameter list, without a resulting break in BC. Specifically, we need $locale parameter now (it is used in the patch), but we do not need $gmt. By adding $locale now, future versions will not need to break backward-compatibility, if $gmt is added back in (provided sufficient justification exists).

{quote}Principially date has to be a wrapper to php's date function to add 64bit timestamp awareness as mktime. This is now no longer given.{quote}

If there is a problem associated with the changes to Zend\_Date\_DateObject::date(), would you please explain?

{quote}Possible problems with ARPA/RFCxxx/RSS/W3C functions due to changed date().{quote}

Would you please provide examples of problems?

{quote}But this change is not a bug fix, this is an complete API change.{quote}

Yes, this patch does affect the API, as requested by the devteam to make the i18n components easier to use by those who are familiar with PHP's date() function (and many other programs using these date format character specifiers).

{quote}And the proposed changes are not "simple", they propose other problems.{quote}

I agree. Careful thought and planning are required. Most of the problems are already solved in the patch, or proposed solutions are listed above.

{quote}Also we "could" make date() public.{quote}

I think we should keep it protected, and instead give access to it using the new toString() which wraps Zend\_Date\_DateObject::date() in a smart way to do the "right" things.

{quote}I would like to have things as they are...

For php date format add a new function toDate or make date public. This would be API conform and would not make the problems which I've seen by looking through the code snippets above.{quote} I have no strong feelings about choosing between: 1) renaming old toString() => toStringIso(), and creating new toString() using PHP date() format 2) add new toStringPhpFormat() using PHP date() format

However, I think all problems mentioned above either do not exist, or have relatively simple solutions.

After thinking about these changes over the holiday weekend, I will vote to support ISO formats by default, but allow Zend\_Date object's to have a user-selectable behavior (input/output using either ISO or PHP date() format specifiers).

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-02-20T15:05:50.000+0000

I am very happy if we can leave ISO implemented as it already is.

Implementation Details:
-----------------------

Internal Zend\_Date should always work with ISO Format. This way we have no problem with CLDR.

Spend Zend\_Date an additional internal/public function which converts the PHP date format string into an ISO format string.

Btw: related to format letters:

WEEKDAY\_DIGIT is in Iso 'e' ISO and RFC can be built by the other format letters but Zend\_Date support these natively.

PERIOD can not be defined upper or lowercase as with PHP because in several locales we have upper and lowercase letters, some have only upper, some only lower case.

All other mentioned formats are supported by Zend\_Date itself and can be used with the proper function. So these are no problem on output. And the ones which can not be written with ISO letters as daylight or period can not be used as input, so there is no problem.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-02-20T15:54:00.000+0000

I agree, the initial request I received for supporting the PHP "way" as the _default_ was difficult and leads to solvable complications. However, making the ISO format specifiers the default avoids most of the complications, and seems quite preferable.

If conversions are done internally, then conversions are an implementation detail not seen by developer. Instead, I like the idea of $date->usePhpDateFormat() ... or something named similar. Then conversions are not added to the API and develoeprs do not need to learn about using conversion functions.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-02-20T16:59:53.000+0000

That's what I meant...

A user has to decide that he NOW wants to use the PHP format

Zend\_Date::ISOFORMAT = FALSE for example. Constant or function... how ever... the user has to do the decision.

And after he has done so, the given php date formats are changed to iso format so they can be processed by Zend\_date internally.

So I think we speak about the same API detail as he just has to call one function to use his "je old" php date format strings.

Removed "fix version", since this feature addition does not have a clear "fix by" version date anymore.

Using a constant would make it difficult for a developer who wants to use ISO formats for new code he writes, when he must also integrate existing code using PHP date() format specifiers. Perhaps we can do both for Zend\_Date:

1) constant specifies default behavior for new Zend\_Date objects 2) individual objects have a property that toggles between ISO formats and PHP date() style formats

For Zend\_Locale, I see more advantages to simply using two functions: 1) getDate() - no changes 2) getDatePhpFormat() - uses PHP date() format

With SVN 3613 two new function were implemented.

convertPhpToIsoFormat() - converts PHP date format strings to the same strings in ISO format. This function can also be used by users (not only internally) as it's static.

toPhpString() - accepts only PHP date format strings to do the same as toString() for a Zend\_Date object

These functionallity is not complete, but I think the actual way supports about 80-90% of the use cases.

Fixed as with SVN 3617.

PHP date formats are now accepted if the static function Zend\_Date::usePhpDateFormat (true); is called once before working with php date format strings.

Either we need to add unit tests (see @todo in testUsePhpDateFormat()) and update the docu, or we need to create new issues when this issue is closed to track these two other tasks (docu + unit tests).

I also added more docu.

Unit tests were added as with SVN 3697.

Now also an exception will be thrown if unsupported tokens will be found within an given format string. This way users will see instantly problems and not get some dates returned as expected and some not... this makes the function more failsave.
