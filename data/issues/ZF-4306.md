ZF-4306: using ReflectionClass
------------------------------

### Description

Is it real necessary to use ReflectionClass in \_\_constructor? It looks like additional dependence and maybe it could be resolved in more convinient way.

$r = new ReflectionClass($this); $this->\_priorities = array\_flip($r->getConstants());

Reflection is built-in to PHP by default -- you must actually explicitly disable it at compile time if you do not want it. A number of ZF components utilize it, and we consider it a standard dependency of the framework.

Moreover, its use here is a good one in terms of maintainability, as it ensures that the constants and priorities stay in sync.
