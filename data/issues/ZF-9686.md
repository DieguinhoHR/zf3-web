### Description

When you try to upload multiple files with Zend\_Form\_Element\_File and use the MimeType validator, you get an exception that the $\_finfo property doesn't exists. This is because after the first validation it is unset (r347 in Zend\_Validate\_File\_MimeType).

Implemented with r21860. This is not a bug but a improvement.

The provided patch is incomplete.

How can it not be a bug?
