### Description

There are a handful of Zend\_Gdata classes which do not lazy-load exceptions before throwing them. These should be corrected and stricken from the list of offending classes at:

Currently waiting on clarification of policy for Exception subclasses, since these also show up on the list of classes to be fixed.

Okay, as I expected, Exception subclasses are exempt. That leaves about 5 classes that need to be fixed.

Committed some changes in r7575 to lazy load exception clasess that were throwing exceptions as they weren't loaded prior to instantiation :)

Ryan, I think those were the exceptions that needed to be updated to resolve ZF-1752. I've had a patch sitting around to do that for a while (it's a simple change), but I've been hesitant to commit it without updating the unit tests.

Hi Trevor,

Yep-- sorry, didn't see that bug. This was causing exceptions when running the sample app. While unit tests would be nice, my priority in this case was making the sample app work :) I resolved the issue, but left it assigned to you so you can attach unit tests if/when you get a chance. If you'd prefer to re-open it in the meantime, that'd be fine too.

We should have a status of 'resolved in trunk, but still needs unit test'

Cheers, -Ryan
