### Description

Hello, I have a problem. I need to change the validation of a tag key, but it is impossible with the current implementation of Zend\_Cache.

In Zend\_Cache\_Core ([http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php/…](http://framework.zend.com/code/filedetails.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=%2Ftrunk%2Flibrary%2FZend%2FCache%2FCore.php&peg=14521)) I can override \_validateIdOrTag() method but there is no sense because this static method is used by other methods of Zend\_Cache\_Core as self::\_validateIdOrTag().

I can create my own Cache\_Core class but in this way I have to copy/paste all methods using \_validateIdOrTag().

A solution would be to replace all self::\_validateIdOrTag() to static::\_validateIdOrTag() but it works only with php5.3. Also it can be a non-static method (with \_validateTagsArray) because it is used only by non-static methods.

Thank you!

This will be fixed by rewrite of Zend\\Cache in ZF2. @see [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend+Cache+2.0+-+Marc+Bennewitz)

It can't be fixed in ZF1 because of design limitations.

This issue won't be fixed in ZF1. -> fixed in ZF2-138
