ZF-9880: Search options in Zend\_Service\_Flickr do not match those in the Flick API method

### Description

The userSearch function in Zend\_Service\_Flickr offers additional query options (min\_upload\_date, max\_upload\_date, min\_taken\_date, max\_taken\_date) that do not exist in the Flick API method that is called (flickr.people.getPublicPhotos)

It would be better to use flickr.photos.search which does have these query options (and a whole lot more).

It seems all the specific options listed above are now available.

I am thinking of submitting a new method that implements flickr.photos.search, which includes the ability to search by tags and user\_id in the same search. Just submitted my Contributor License Agreement today so hopefully won't take too long.

Ok, scrap the above comment. It seems tagSearch() already uses flickr.photos.search and also has a user\_id option, so the same can be achieved with that.

However, I'd still like to consider adding a search() method that can be used for all general searches, rather than expecting tag(s) as its first parameter.
