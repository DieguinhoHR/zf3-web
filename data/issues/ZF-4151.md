### Description

I've been playing around with Zend\_Paginator using the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_Iterator. All went pretty good, until I passed Zend\_Paginator 0 items/pages. I get the following exception:

{quote} exception 'OutOfBoundsException' with message 'Seek position 0 is out of range'

0 [internal function]: ArrayIterator->seek(0)
=============================================

{quote}

Now this exception is not a suprise, after all......it's seeking 0. The question I have is how to handle this exception? I use a foreach loop in my view to iterate over each item in the paginator and that's what's causing the exception:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($this->paginator as $item){}


Should I always check if there are 0 pages/items in the view and not start the foreach loop? Doing so would require a check in each view to see if there's 0 or more items/pages. I don't like that solution.

Are there better ways to handle this exception?

Issue appears to exist still in the null paginator.
