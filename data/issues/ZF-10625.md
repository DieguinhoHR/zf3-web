### Description

Index: library/Zend/Soap/Wsdl.php
=================================

I'm using the wsdl class to generate a wsdl document for my project. I was having trouble with some stuff so I read through the source and spotted a copy paste error in the code. Here's the fix.

If this is a repeat then I apologize, but I couldn't find it through searching.

Fixed.

BTW It also needed 'soap:body' to be replaced with 'soap:fault'.
