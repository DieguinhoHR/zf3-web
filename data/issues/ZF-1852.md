### Description

Change all validators so that a static property is available to store the default message templates. Allowing for validator wide custom messages (rather than per instance). Useful for people who don't want English messages, or just want to change the wording.

I would prefer that the solution to overriding the default class configuration values preserves the ability to individually configure validation class instances, as well.

Yeah that makes sense. I guess you would have a static property that stores the defaults, and then another property which has the defaults copied in when a new instance is created?

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

I don't think that this is needed anymore.

You can set different messages per instance which already worked before. Or you can use translation and attach it to the instance, which will then translate the messages.

The result is the same as before because you will always use the same translation, but have still the ability to change the content manually.

Closed due to no response.

This change seems no longer to be needed. Feel free to reopen this issue when you have new informations.
