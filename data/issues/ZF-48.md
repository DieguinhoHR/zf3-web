Note: The MySQLi adapter uses the mysqli driver (<http://www.php.net/mysqli>) instead of the driver used by PDO (<http://www.php.net/pdo>).

        While i was playing around with Zend_Db_Table, i noticed that the Mysqli Adapter has a 'bug' ? It requires Zend_Db_Adapter_Interface and extends it, but it doesn't exist :)
    
        Can someone please inform if this is actually a bug ?


Hi Rui,

This is a known bug and will be fixed before the next release.

Thanks, Mike

Please use the PDO adapter for MySQL. The PDO adapter offers superior features and performance.

Also see [ZF-103].

Please enable mysqli feature as I'm using PHP 5.0.4 which no PDO included...

Hi Gavin

Thanks, I will commit my changes to the incubator and we can then move it back to core if its agreed.

Superbiji, 5.0.4 is not supported with Zend Framework 0.1.5 and future releases. Please upgrade to at least PHP 5.1.4, which includes PDO by default.

Please help Eugene by "svn update" and testing, suggesting improvements, and reviewing code for the all new mysqli adapter. We _need_ help writing unit tests.
