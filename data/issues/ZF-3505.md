### Description

ok, i will just tell you what i wanna do in my view:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    I want to do this in one line!
    
    For this to work this fix has to be applied:


Index: View/Helper/FormElement.php
==================================

--- View/Helper/FormElement.php (revision 9781) +++ View/Helper/FormElement.php (working copy) @@ -117,7 +117,7 @@ && is\_scalar($info['attribs']['disable'])) { // disable the element - $info['disable'] = true; + $info['disable'] = (bool)$info['attribs']['disable']; unset($info['attribs']['disable']); } elseif (isset($info['attribs']['disable']) && is\_array($info['attribs']['disable'])) ``` so that disabled doesnt get assigned true when the boolean disable value is false

this is against [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend) and NOT TESTED that's also the reason why i'm posting here as bug and not patch

Thanks and nice job with the framework

Alex
