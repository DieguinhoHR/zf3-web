ZF-9433: Zend\_Validate\_CreditCard does not allow 13 digit Visa cards

### Description

This would appear to be a fairly serious issue as people willing to pay for services are being turned away due to incorrect validation!

Reading over old comments here: [http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://www.framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6980?focusedCommentId=31751&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_31751)

it appears the 13 digit visa card is mentioned and the Wikipedia link also states that visa cards can be 13 or 16 digit in length: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\_card\_number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card_number)

This is why I've marked this bug as critical. It's not a crasher, but people could easily be losing money!

The patch to fix this is trivial (adding in a 13 to an array, so I will not bother providing a patch.

13 digit visa card are no longer available since 2005. According to Visa itself all cards (since then) have 16 digits.

This means 13 digit cards are historical cards. For ZF this means that when we accept historical cards (note that they are already exceeded) we would open a possible security leak.

Interesting. Thanks very much for the info.

We discovered the problem when testing payment gateway integration with SagePay. They still issue such card numbers for testing and integration purposes which caused problems as we pre-validate things prior to handing over to the payment gateway.

The quote you posted is interesting in it's phrasing: It still says "up to 16 digits" in both the "until 2011" and the "new" sections which concerns me slightly. They should really use the term "exactly 16 digits" if that's what they mean....

Not sure what to do about this. While I agree the number is technically invalid, if this trips a lot of people up during their testing phase it can cause a lot of problems.

I can see my original concern of loosing money from customers is invalid, but loosing development time is still a concern. Obviously this may not be a problem in a wider sense but if gateways other than SagePay still regularly use such numbers would it be wise to still accept them until usage has dropped to a suitably low level? I have no idea how we'd go about gauging how many gateways still use them, it could be a very isolated case or it could be quite common. Any thoughts?

They also say "4 groups of 4 digits" which implies 16 digits (4x4).

There is still no problem at all... when a user has a 13 digit visa card he is using an outdated card... so latest the validation at SagePay will fail as it does a deeper validation than digit count.

You are free to extent this validator to allow such "historical" cards even it we know that they are not accepted by visa itself anymore.

I'll have to check with my colleague but I'm pretty certain the card number issued by SagePay here for testing is one for which they ultimately send back an Approved response.

Personally I'm not all that bothered as I can advise our clients who configure new SagePay accounts and test integration prior to live deployment that the 13 digit test card is invalid (we're not a big enough operation that this is unmanageable). My only real concern now is that this ultimately causes other developers a lot of head scratching if this kind of "valid 13 digit test card" practice is common place among gateway providers. I'll get in touch with the SagePay people and see what they say about this and report back.

Thanks again for your work and replies :)

We got this repsonse from a SagePay support guy (I'm sure he wont mind it being copied here):

"You are correct, 13 digit Visa cards are no longer in circulation, we are aware of this issue and hopefully it will be corrected soon.

In the mean time please ignore testing with the Visa test card if it causes issues, your system just needs to be able to process 16 digit Visa cards."

So it seems they are admitting that their 13 digit test card is a bad idea. I guess we just need to keep on top of our testing practices with third parties so that they do not used the card.

Thanks for your effort and replies and I'll put this one down to being SagePay's fault and hopefully an isolated practice rather and a widespread misuse from other gateways too.
