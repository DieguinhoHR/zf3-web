### Description

Apparently, Zend\_Captcha word wasn't saved on session, and I always get a "Captcha value is wrong". I've made a var\_dump on $captcha->getCaptcha()->getWord() and the value is "NULL". I did the same thing on Zend\_Captcha\_Word isValid function and again, $this->getWord() is equal to "NULL"

I am currently unable to reproduce, but will look into it for RC3.

Please see ZF-4045 comment for indication of why I am closing this -- I cannot reproduce, and at this point assume that it is a local session storage issue.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
