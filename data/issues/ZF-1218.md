### Description

Hi,

I would set a specific route like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    but a can't find a method to configure this route.
    
    This dosn't call modules:


$route = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route( ':locale/:module/:controller/:action', array( 'locale' => new Zend\_Locale(Zend\_Locale::BROWSER), 'module' => 'default', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index' ) ); ```

and in Zend\_Controller\_Route\_Module I can't set the locale param position

What do you mean by "doesn't call modules"? This route should inject the module for the use in dispatcher. Isn't it working? Could you please submit some short code to illustrate your problem better?

No problem. Thanks for trying to help anyhow.

Probably the only way that you'll get a route like you specify to act like the default module route is to override the modules route to assign the first path element as the locale, and then match the rest of the path following the same algorithm as the module route -- which would be an issue we would leave to you to implement.
