### Description

Example 15.101 [1] on the Zend\_Db\_Table documentation page shows an example of code that doesn't actually work. It uses an array($condition => $value) in the where clause:

$select = $table->select()->where(array('bug\_status = ?' => 'NEW'))

But as far as I can see, this isn't implemented. I think it should be changed to:

$select = $table->select()->where('bug\_status = ?', 'NEW')
