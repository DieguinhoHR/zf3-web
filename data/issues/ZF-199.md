ZF-199: Controller names with more than one uppercase character not dispatched

### Description

I wanted to create a controller name SubClientController only to find I couldn't because of limitations inside the framework. It you create a controller name with an uppercase character anyway other than the first (which is obviously required) you will not be able to execute it.

Fortunately the solution is simple. Look in Zend/Controller/Dispatcher.php line 93 under "protected function _formatName($unformatted)" you have the line: $unformatted = str\_replace(array('-', '_', '.'), ' ', strtolower($unformatted)); The strtolower() call here is what is causing the limitation.

As far as I can tell, although I've not had a chance to test it that function call can simply be removed: $unformatted = str\_replace(array('-', '\_', '.'), ' ', $unformatted);

and the limitation no longer exists.

You can use _SubUserController_ but link will be like this: [http://example.com/Sub\_Action/](http://example.com/Sub_Action/) or <http://example.com/Sub-Action/>

And of course if you had to saw that Zend/Controller/Dispatcher.php contains not only _$unformatted = str\_replace(array('-', '\_', '.'), ' ', strtolower($unformatted));_ in \_formatName($unformatted)

So here's \_formatName method from Dispatcher.php of ZendFramework 0.1.4 with my comments :)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _formatName($unformatted)
    {
        // First it replaces hyphens, underscopes and dots with space of case-lowered
        // name. So for example 'SubUser' becomes 'subuser',
        // but 'Sub-User' becomes 'sub user'
        $unformatted = str_replace(array('-', '_', '.'), ' ', strtolower($unformatted));
        // Now strips all chars that are not alphanumeric or spaces, so
        // for example 'sub& +user' becomes 'sub user'
        $unformatted = preg_replace('[^a-z0-9 ]', '', $unformatted);
        // returning formatted name with removed spaces and each word with
        // capital letter, so 'sub user' becomes 'SubUser'
        return str_replace(' ', '', ucwords($unformatted));
    }


So it is not a bug imho.

This is by design. URLs are case sensitive, but allowing mixed case adds complexity when propagating URLs. As a result, it was decided early that mixed case controller and action names would not be supported.

There are workarounds if you really wish to use mixed case controller/action names, including Aleksey's solution above as well as writing your own dispatcher (this is actually pretty trivial).

Added note detailing original decision and workarounds.
