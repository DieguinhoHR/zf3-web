### Description

Hi, the following code opens a new connection every time this code is invoked without closing it:

BEGIN CODE:

public static function nextEpisode( $id, $is\_admin = true ) {

 
    $episode = new Episode();
    
    if ( $is_admin ) {
        $where = $episode->getAdapter()->quoteInto( 'id > ?', $id );
    }
    else {
        $where = array( 'is_activated = ?' => 1, 'id > ?' => $id );
    }
    
    $orderBy = 'id ASC';
    $nextEpisode = $episode->fetchRow( $where, $orderBy );
    
        $database = Zend_Registry::get( 'database' );
        $database->closeConnection();
    
        return $nextEpisode;
    
    }


END CODE:

Also, I have the following lines in my bootstrap file:

BEGIN BOOTSTRAP:

$database = Zend\_Db::factory( $config->database->adapter, $config->database->toArray() ); Zend\_Db\_Table::setDefaultAdapter( $database ); Zend\_Registry::set( 'database', $database );

END BOOTSTRAP:

->closeConnection() should (really) close the connection, but take care that every further call to any method that needs the database, will re-open it automatically

Hi, the issue that I'm seeing that a connection is being created and remains open everytime I invoke the code. Thus,

$database->closeConnection();

does nothing in the above code snippet. Is this the correct functionality?

It is. closeConnection() just destroyes phisically the connection like PHP does at the end of the script. So on your exemple, your closeConnection() line is not needed

Hi, I reloaded the page 1000 times that hits the above code and it resulted in having 1000 connections created.

Hi, I stand corrected. It seems that I was looking at the wrong variable in regards to the current open connections.

The behaviour is the desired one, closing this as Non-issue
