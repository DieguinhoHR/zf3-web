ZF-3664: No init() function called in constructor
-------------------------------------------------

### Description

When extending Zend\_Mail I discovered that the Zend\_Mail class does not follow the convention to call an init() method as the last constructor action. To override settings when the class is instantiated one must override the constructor itself.

There is no convention to call init() as last constructor action.

I vote for No-Issue.

There's no convention for ZF that prescribes the need of an init-method. If you feel there should be one in Zend\_Mail, you could add a feature request for this.
