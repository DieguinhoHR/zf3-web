ZF-8641: Add setPhpConstant function to Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap

### Description

To support legacy code and other implementations where constants are useful. The following function was needed in the Bootstrap, perhaps it could be moved into Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract? Proven helpful when working in development, staging, testing, production paradigms, where constants have different values. This allows one ini script to cover all instances, which means that code migration can be easily automated.

 
    public function setPhpConstant($value){
        foreach ($value as $constant=>$value){
            defined($constant) || define($constant,$value);
        }
    }


Sample ini file line: phpConstant.FOO = 'bar'
