### Description

Segment routing is not working with multiple module. In application configuration if I add more than one module then the first module's segment routing doesn't work properly. For single module it works well. This is the application module configuration. 'modules' => array( 'App1', 'App2', ), 'module\_paths' => array( './module', './vendor', ),

Please attach your routing config as well.
