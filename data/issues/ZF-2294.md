### Description

The README.txt file located at $/trunk/incubator/documentation/manual (line 25) shows that libxslt is located under Devel, on my Cygwin installer it only shows it under the Libs category.

This depends on the cygwin version... On my windows install from one year ago it was under devil.

But as this is only a note on an installer it should be no problem
