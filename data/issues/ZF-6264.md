ZF-6264: ArgumentParser can NOT process custom command line options
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-04-10T13:24:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-06-28T13:22:26.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently the Argument Parser in Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Console ist not able to process any options but

 
        $getoptOptions['help|h']    = 'HELP';
        $getoptOptions['verbose|v'] = 'VERBOSE';
        $getoptOptions['pretend|p'] = 'PRETEND';
        $getoptOptions['debug|d']   = 'DEBUG';


Witch are defined in \_parseGlobalPart();

The problem is now caused by:

 
        $getoptParser = new Zend_Console_Getopt($getoptOptions, $this->_argumentsWorking, array('parseAll' => false));
        $getoptParser->parse();


Which crashes the application if any other option than the named is given.

Example:

sh zf.sh show version --mode=mini results in: Option "mode" is not recognized.

Sorry, just noticed the syntax has changed from earlier drafts.

The problem occurs in Getopt::parse() where not no option 'parseAll' is processed and thus no remaining arguments can be expected.

A simple hack would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     if (substr($argv[0], 0, 2) == '--') {
         if (!$this->_getoptConfig['parseAll']) {
               try {
                     $this->_parseLongOption($argv);
                } catch(Zend_Console_Getopt_Exception $e) {
                }
         } else {
                $this->_parseLongOption($argv);
         }
    }

This was fixed in a previous release, closing as fixed as this was an issue in the past.
