ZF-7410: getAdapter function for Zend\_Db
-----------------------------------------

### Description

I create a DB object at bootstrap by $db = Zend\_Db::factory($database\_config), and store it into the Registry for later use.

$database\_config is a Zend\_Config object containing the adapter, params etc...

The problem here, is when I use a mixture of databases, say MSSQL & MYSQL. The SQL statements for the two databases potentially differ.

So when writing DAOs, I need to cater for the differences. I need to know what adapter (or database type) that the $db object represents.

getDbConfig() returns params, but no adapter type.

I note that there is a \_pdoType in some DB Adapters, but its protected. However, this will only apply to PDO I guess.

Can I request that getDbConfig() be extended to include adapter information? or a new function getDbAdapter().

Whats wrong with doing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    $db = $registry->get('db');
    
    if ($db instanceof Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql) {
       // mysql specific
    } elseif ($db instanceof Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv) {
       // mssql specific
    }
    


?
