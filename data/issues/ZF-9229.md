### Description

When uploading a file with a post. The mime-type was always 'application/octet-stream'. The function mime\_content\_type is deprecated and doesn't work on my server. To get the mimetype send by the browser, I add a function in the Abstract adapter.

File: /File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php Line: 1294 Code: if (empty($result) && (function\_exists('mime\_content\_type'){ ... } Insert after:

if( empty($result) && isset($value['type']) ) { $result = $value['type']; }

As described in the manual, using the mimetype which is sent from the client is very unsecure.

For security reasons the clients mimetype will never be used.

Thank you for the reply, i'll ask the host if they will install the fileinfo package

When you really want to get unsecure you could store the mimetype your client set before any model is invoked and work with this mimetype.

But, as noted before, ZF methods will not use this value for security reasons. Even the Mimetype Validator will not use your value, but the real found mimetype.

In this case you would have to extend the classes you want to use (Zend\_File, Zend\_Validate, Zend\_Filter and so on...) and add this unsecure behaviour in userland.

Note: This is workflow you should prevent in any case when there is a possibility for you.
