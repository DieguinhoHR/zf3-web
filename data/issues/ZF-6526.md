ZF-6526: setClass argv argument documentation requested
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I am trying to figure out how to pass arguments to setClass for XmlRpc Server. According to the documentation (and the code) the function accepts a 3rd argument to be passed to the methods. But I can't figure out how to get it to work and google doesn't yield any results about this either.

This is not a bug per-se, more like a Request for documentation.

I'll update the documentation. In the mean time, here's what you need to know: \* Any additional arguments in excess of 2 passed to setClass() are considered invocation arguments \* Invocation arguments are appended to any arguments passed to the method call prior to calling the method

As an example, if you do the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $server->setClass('Foo', 'foo', 'hello', 'world');


Then you will have two invocation arguments, 'hello', and 'world'. If you then call the method 'foo.bar', which maps to the method 'bar' in class Foo, as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foo.bar('baz');


Then the actual call will be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foo.bar('baz', 'hello', 'world');


In other words, the arguments you provided to setClass() are now passed as additional arguments to the method call.

One way this is useful is for passing an authentication token to each service method; your service class can then pull it off the end and check ACLs prior to executing any work.

So far the theory. Reality is, that this will never work because of:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setClass($class, $namespace = '', $argv = null)
        {
            if (is_string($class) && !class_exists($class)) {
                if (!class_exists($class)) {
                    #require_once 'Zend/XmlRpc/Server/Exception.php';
                    throw new Zend_XmlRpc_Server_Exception('Invalid method class', 610);
                }
            }
    
            $argv = null;
            if (3 < func_num_args()) {
                $argv = func_get_args();
                $argv = array_slice($argv, 3);
            }
    


If $argv is set, func\_num\_args() will return 3, not > 3. And it will never reach the slice() call, which is wrong too (should be offset 2, not offset 3).

The behavior is now fixed so that it works as documented.
