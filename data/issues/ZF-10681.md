ZF-10681: Array\_merge redefines numeric keys
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-11-13T07:15:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-18T09:16:29.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The default route in the router is merged with the existing routes through array\_merge(). Unfortunately the php guys think this is no bug, though an report has been made (<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=18075>).

When routes are added and their keys have a special reason to be non-incremental, the preservation of keys is important (eg when they represent a page id). Suggestion is to use the plus-sign instead of array\_merge(). Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    To this:
    


This issue is a bit related to <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3726> where also the preservation of keys is important.

Why should the id of a route be equal (after parsing) to that of e.g. a page id?

bq. Why should the id of a route be equal (after parsing) to that of e.g. a page id?

Not in particular, but you could add a route "blog" for you blog-related route. This name is used when you later want to use that route. The same counts for other names. In my case, the names are numeric (representing page ids) which causes it to go wrong. The usage of names for routes in pretty common ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html)), but only arise when numeric names (ie keys in the routes array) are used.
