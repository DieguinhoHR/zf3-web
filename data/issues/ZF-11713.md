ZF-11713: When using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row with \_transformColumn setFromArray does not work correctly (and also \_\_construct)

### Description

Create a sub class of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row with an implemention/override of \_transformColumn that actually changes names. Create a new row using the class. Call setFromArray on the object with an array with keys that are supposed to be transformed to new names. Notice no values actually make it into the object.

Issue is that setFromArray (and also \_\_construct for that matter) do not call \_transformColumn. setFromArray in particular also performs and array\_intersect before setting values via \_\_set. Because the incoming keys have not been transformed first, and the intersect only looks at already transformed names, the result is an empty array and no calls to \_\_set are even made.

Should be fixed, but work around: In the sub-class also implement setFromArray and do it right by effectively implementing the intersect in the pre-transform set of names.
