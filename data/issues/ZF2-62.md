This [patch](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/655) solves the issue.

But i think the cloud tests need some improvements!

I rewrote all the unit tests of Zend\\Cloud\\Infrastructure. The tests are offline, that means you don't need a cloud account (Amazon EC2 or Rackspace) to run the unit tests.
