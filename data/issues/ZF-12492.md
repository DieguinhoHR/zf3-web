assertHeaderContains and assertNotHeaderContains Fails when match is at the beginning of the string. This is caused the the strstr function returning 0 which is being evaluated to false.

Fix is simple by just doing a cast to bool:

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Constraint\_ResponseHeader::\_headerContains: return (strstr($contents, $match) !== false);

Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_Constraint\_ResponseHeader::\_notHeaderContains: return (strstr($contents, $match) === false);

Corrrection to description, If '0' is used for the string it will be evaluated as false: ex $this->assertHeaderContains('Expires', '0');
