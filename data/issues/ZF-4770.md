### Description

Currently The Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover and Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl classes are based on very strict xml string equality matches, which may fail on different boxes due to PHP\_EOL or other issues.

The Tests should be rewritten to use XPath or check for XML partials to be more reliable.

Rewriting the testsuites depends on the general purpose WSDL parser.
