ZF-4206: Add ability to get full raw message from Mbox

### Description

I was adding removeMessage() functionality to the Mbox storage component, but found that the line that delineates one mbox message from another is stripped during the \_openMboxFile call, due to calling \_isMboxFile in that method.

I created a patch for the Mbox storage component to return literally the full string of the message from mbox. I intend to use this when adding removeMessage functionality. I was hoping that the patch could be considered for inclusion in the standard distribution of ZF. If not can someone vouch for the intent to add the functionality of removeMessage to the Mbox component?
