### Description

There has been substantial confusion arising from the API change for those who missed the email discusison: [http://nabble.com/API-change-in-the-RewriteRouter-…](http://www.nabble.com/API-change-in-the-RewriteRouter-tf1943012.html#a5327149)

./library/Zend/Controller/RewriteRouter.php: public function addRoute($name, Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface $ route)

Documentation updates should be made in parallel with API changes for components that have been released in an official preview release of the ZF.

The corresponding file in SVN has not been updated to reflect the API change. [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.rewriterouter.variable-defaults.html)
