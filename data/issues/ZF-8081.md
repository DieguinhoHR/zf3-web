### Description

Zend\_Form\_SubForm objects do not populate correctly when parent Zend\_Form object contains an element with the same name and no value is passed in for the subform's element. For example, suppose a Zend\_Form object has a field named 'id', corresponding to the unique id (from the database and model) of an object. The form then adds a SubForm object, which also contains elements with the name of 'id', corresponding to the unique id of some other, independent models that are linked to the first model.

When you call populate() on the parent form, the subform's 'id' elements are populated with the 'id' values of the parent form if the value in the passed array corresponding to that subform is empty. The expected behavior is that the subform's 'id' elements would remain empty, since they did not have a value passed in.

If a value is passed in corresponding to the subform, the correct behavior occurs: that subform field is populated with the correct values. It only occurs when a value is not passed for that subform to populate()...the parent form's 'id' value trickles down instead.

Example Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //Edit form for an object, for example, an article
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    
    //the id element 
    $form->addElement('text', 'id', array('label' => 'Id'));
    
    $form->addElement('text', 'name', array('label' => 'Article Title'));
    
    //Create a subform for the article's author (which is in the db with separate Id)
    $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm();
    
    //Add author to subform
    $subForm->addElement('text', 'id', array('label' => 'Author Id'));
    $subForm->addElement('text', 'author_name', array('label' => 'Author Name'));
    
    
    //Add the subform to the form
    $form->addSubForm($subForm, 'author');
    
    //Now populate...this is where the errors occur (if no author id is passed in)
    
    $values = array(
        'id' => 7,
        'name' => 'Test Article'//Note the absence of an entry for the subform named 'author'
    );
    
    $form->populate($values);
    
    echo $form;

Could you please provide some code by which we can reproduce this behaviour? thanks.

Add example code after more investigation. The problem occurs when a key for the subform is not present in the array passed to populate
