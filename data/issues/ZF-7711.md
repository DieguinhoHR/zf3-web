### Description

The render() method of Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_File add a progress\_key to track file uploads if APC or upload\_progress is available. If APC is available, the progress\_key is set to APC\_UPLOAD\_PROGRESS. However, this value should not be hard-coded, as it is configurable in the php.ini file by the apc.rfc1867\_name setting.

Ideally, Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_File should read out the apc.rfc1867\_name setting from the php.ini and use that value.
