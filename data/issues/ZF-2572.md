### Description

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap makes use of Zend\_Log throughout, causing an unnecessary dependency between the components. I understand that this was created in an effort to make debugging LDAP authentication issues easier, since it can be notoriously complicated. However, this can be accomplished in a different way. For example, the instance may accumulate its own debugging information (e.g., data stored in a protected variable, accessible via public method), and users can do whatever they wish with the debugging information, including logging functionality, without having to impose a hard-coded dependency.
