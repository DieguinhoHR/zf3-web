ZF-1750: Make Db adapters return consistent datatype from lastInsertId()
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When queried for lastInsertId , the PDO\_MYSQL returns a string representing the id of the last inserted row instead of an integer. The MYSQLi adapter returns an integer (I cannot comment on any other adapters since I have not tested further). In the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, the result of lastInsertId is defined as integer.

This does affect most of the Db adapters, and it also affects the lastSequenceId() and nextSequenceId() methods.

Most adapters return a string, even though you might expect the value of an auto-generated value would be an integer. The datatype is string because the RDBMS might return a 64-bit integer value, but this would result in an overflow on 32-bit PHP distributions.

In the case of the mysqli extension, the last\_insertid class property is a PHP int so it is at risk of overflow if you use a primary key with a datatype of BIGINT or SERIAL and AUTO\_INCREMENT modifier. But there is not much we can do about that, it's a design flaw in the mysqli extension.
