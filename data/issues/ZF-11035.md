### Description

It seems there is no way simple way set pass a class on the DT element created by the default decorators. This can be quite useful for CSS styling. We can of course create a custom decorator, but that doesn't seem necessary, in particular when we can do this on the associated DD by passing a class option to the HtmlTag decorator of the decorated element.

Hi Matthieu, I can not reproduce your problem.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // View
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->setEncoding('utf-8');
    $view->doctype('XHTML1_STRICT');
    
    // Form
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    
    // Element
    $form->addElement(
        'text',
        'foo',
        array(
            'label' => 'Foo',
            'decorators' => array(
                'ViewHelper',
                'Errors',
                array(
                    // Decorator name
                    'Description',
                    // Decorator options
                    array(
                        'tag'   => 'p',
                        'class' => 'description',
                    ),
                ),
                array(
                    // Decorator name
                    array(
                        'element' => 'HtmlTag',
                    ),
                    array(
                        'tag' => 'dd',
                    ),
                ),
                array(
                    // Decorator name
                    array(
                        'closeDt' => 'HtmlTag',
                    ),
                    // Decorator options
                    array(
                        'tag'       => 'dt',
                        'closeOnly' => true,
                        'placement' => 'prepend'
                    ),
                ),
                'Label',
                array(
                    // Decorator name
                    array(
                        'openDt' => 'HtmlTag',
                    ),
                    // Decorator options
                    array(
                        'tag'      => 'dt',
                        'openOnly' => true,
                        'class'    => 'bar',
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        )
    );
    
    echo $form->render($view);


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    


                Foo
            
            
                
        

Callback and ViewScript are also default decorators.

Hi Kai,

We can of course use a specific list of decorators, but the goal here is to use the default ones, loaded by Zend\_Form\_Element::loadDefaultDecorators().

The point is to use only a simple line to pass the 'tagClass' parameter to the Label decorator automatically applied, i.e. :

$element->getDecorator('label')->setOption('tagClass', 'myClass ');

That tagClass would be used by the Label decorator when(/if) calling HtmlTag internally to add a wrapper.

Right now we can add a class to the DD definition with quite the same syntax ( $element->getDecorator('HtmlTag')->setOption('class', 'myClass'); ) so it would feel natural to be able to do this kind of thing for the DT also. P

This is way more concise than having to redeclare all default decorators manually to achieve the same goal, don't you think ?

Actually I already have modified the concerned file to do so, and my CLA just got validated, I just need to figure out how to submit a file. Surprisingly enough, this seems like the hard part of contributing.

 

 

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-08T08:36:11.000+0000

It was clear to me from the beginning. But why is it not in your description of the problem?

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-08T08:41:31.000+0000

Seems to me it is, as long as you understand "default decorators" as the decorators being applied by default, not as the actual existing decorators in the zf lib.

 

 

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-08T09:00:20.000+0000

Standard vs. Default ;-)

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-08T09:06:45.000+0000

Indeed. I stand by my 'default' ;) Any tip on how I can post the modified Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label ?

 

 

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-08T09:12:36.000+0000

I think you need first the CLA. Then you can add a file. In the left sidebar there is a link (under the headline "functions").

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-08T09:21:08.000+0000

This is a modified version of Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label allowing to set a class on its DT wrapper

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-08T09:25:55.000+0000

That didn't seem to me like the right place, but well... if you say so. I'll just close the ticket and see what happens then ;)

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-08T09:26:57.000+0000

added the functionnality requested

 

 

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-08T09:32:41.000+0000

Not to fast! Please add a patch file and write unit test!

 

 

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-08T09:44:13.000+0000

- No unit tests

Posted by Kai Uwe (kaiuwe) on 2011-02-24T05:15:44.000+0000

Please do not close an issue when not all work is done!

- Add a patch file for tests.
- The comment of your method is wrong.

This is a case for the component maintainer!

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-24T06:29:40.000+0000

Kai, what is wrong with the comment ? what do you mean by "This is a case for the component maintainer!" ?

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-02-24T06:32:37.000+0000

patch for the test

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2011-03-01T10:28:16.000+0000

Matthieu -- he means that until the patch is _applied_, you shouldn't close it. :)

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2011-03-01T10:41:55.000+0000

Patches applied to trunk and 1.11 release branch.

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-03-01T10:45:42.000+0000

Thanks for the info, Matthew. That link was very tempting ;) Perhaps it'd be better just not to have the power to close/resolve at all, then, if we can't fill all the requirements to do so.

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-03-01T10:46:44.000+0000

Sweet :) Thanks man, you just officalized my first contribution.

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-03-07T01:57:19.000+0000

new patch from current version integrating the tagClass option in the comments

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-03-07T01:58:58.000+0000

please someone integrate this new patch so that the added option is described in the class comments

 

 

Posted by Matthieu Larcher (mattso) on 2011-04-18T12:43:53.000+0000

anyone to push that ?
