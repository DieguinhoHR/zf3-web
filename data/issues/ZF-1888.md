ZF-1888: formSubmit helper messes up DOM

### Description

The name parameter messes up DOM in firefox:

$xhtml = '<input type="submit"' . ' name="' . $this->view->escape($name) . '"' . ' id="' . $this->view->escape($id) . '"';

It causes the function submit() for the form to be overwritten by the submit element preventing javascript submit through getElementById(myFormId).submit().

Tested in firefox.

I'm afraid I don't understand; how is the form's javascript submit() method being overwritten? The helper is simply generating valid XHTML markup, and ensuring the element has name and id attributes. What would need to change to fix your issue?

When you call form.submit() in a javascript and you've assigned an id to the form.submit you're calling a id instead of a function. What you should do is simply remove the id"..." part.

If we remove the 'id' part, then DOM can no longer be used to locate the element by unique id. I'd suggest that you not name your submit elements 'submit' to correct this.
