### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite depends on the PHP extension 'sqlite', not PDO\_SQLITE as supposed by Zend\_Cache\_AllTests that I wrote recently.

Please skip Sqlite tests if the 'sqlite' extension is not present.

Please write code in the Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite class to detect when the extension is not present, and throw an informative exception instead of aborting the process with a fatal error about a missing method 'sqlite\_open()'.
