### Description

If a cursor is opened, and an incomplete result set is fetched, the cursor must be closed or else subsequent queries cannot run.

For example, in the Adapter methods fetchRow() and fetchOne(), only a single row of the result set is fetched. The cursor should be closed explicitly in these methods.

There are also some unit tests that fetch one row of a result set but do not close the cursor.
