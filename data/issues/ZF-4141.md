ZF-4141: Zend\_View\_Helper\_PartialLoop forces objects to array conversion when object exposes toArray()

### Description

I would like to use the ability exposed in the partialLoop helper to access a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract as an object.

Unfortunately, if an object exposes toArray() as one of it's method (which is the case here for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract) , then it is automatically converted to an array, instead of offering the possibility to use it as an object instance.

Sample code:

 
         $this->partialLoop()->setObjectKey('object');
         echo $this->partialLoop('my_partial_view',$rowset_data);


Make sure that $rowset\_data is of type Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract

I just tested this against svn and it works just fine.

Have you tried using 1.6.1 to see if this problem is fixed.

My Test Table Object

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once ('Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php');
    
    class Test extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        protected $_name = 'test';
    }


Here is what I have in my controller file

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('mysqli', array('host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'my_user', 'password' => 'my_passwod', 'dbname' => 'test_db'));
            $test = new Test(array(
                'db' => $db
                ));
    
            $this->view->results = $test->fetchAll();


Here is what I have in my view:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->partialLoop()->setObjectKey('object');
    echo $this->partialLoop('index/_pl.phtml', $this->results);


here is what is in my \_pl.phtml file

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    print_r($this->object->toArray());
    $name = $this->object->name;
    print "Name: " . $name . "<br></br>";
