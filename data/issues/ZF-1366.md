### Description

Issue report from Hideto Shinoda:

I found issue in Zend\_Date\_DateObject::mktime. The problem of 1901 years or less in the year happens.

My emvironment; PHP: 5.2.1 Zend Framework: 0.9.3beta Timezone: Asia/Japan.

source file;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $d = new Zend_Date('1901-12-30 02:12:13', 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'); echo $d;


execution result

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1901/12/30 20:12:13


It is sure to become "1901/12/30 2:12:13" correctly.

file: Zend/Date/DateObject.php line: 249

current source;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = -(($date * 86400) + (86400 - (($hour * 3600) + ($minute * 60) + $second)) + $difference);


Under GMT+nn environment, the code can run collectly. But GMT-nn environment, the code output wrong time. I think "+ $difference" has a problem and modified to "- $difference". It became operation assumed by correcting it as follows.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = -(($date * 86400) + (86400 - (($hour * 3600) + ($minute * 60) + $second)) - $difference);


Please check it. I hope please.

Fixed as with SVN 4786.

Note: Timezones where official introduces at 19.March.1918. Zend\_Date emulates timezones for dates prior to this one but for historical correct results it is recommended only to use the timezone GMT for dates prior to 19.March.1918. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_zone#History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#History) for details
