ZF-2676: official pear channel for Zend Framework

### Description

It would be really helpful if there was an official zend.com pear-compatible channel through which the framework could be installed and upgraded. There are two inofficial ones, but they are not upgraded regularly and depending on them for projects is too insecure.

We're considering a PEAR channel to help with the environment setup that will be required for Zend\_Tool. Ralph will have more details in the next few months.

zfcampus seems to be updated very unfrequent (current version is 1.11.9, available at zfcampus is 1.11.3). Are there any plans to provide an up-to-date channel for ZF1?
