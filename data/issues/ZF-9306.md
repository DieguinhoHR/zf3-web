### Description

Hi,

I raised now couple of days a ticket related to autoloading not working properly on 1.10.1 and 1.10.2

<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9263>

As a part of the problem seems to be fixable i am posting here the problem.

The is\_readable is producing a PHP warning if the filename is absolute, when checking against all the include paths. So, the checking for against include\_paths should be done ONLY if the filename is relative path ! Otherwise should be skipped.

Sample below:

Warning: is\_readable(): open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(D:\\wamp\\frameworks\\ZendFramework-1.10.2/D:\_Work\\myapp/application/modules\\articles/views\\helpers/HeadLink.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (D:\_Work\\;D:\\wamp\\;C:\\Windows\\Temp\\;c:\\php5\\pear) in D:\\wamp\\frameworks\\ZendFramework-1.10.2\\Zend\\Loader.php on line 190

A quick (maybe not the best) fix would be to actually check the parent

public static function isReadable($filename) { if (is\_readable($filename)) { // Return early if the filename is readable without needing the // include\_path return true; }

//added the if, basically to skip any absolute filename path if(!is\_readable(dirname($filename))) foreach (self::explodeIncludePath() as $path) { if ($path == '.') { if (is\_readable($filename)) { return true; } continue; } $file = $path . '/' . $filename; if (is\_readable($file)) { return true; } }

return false; }

Pasting same error again:

Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(D:\\wamp\\frameworks\\ZendFramework-1.10.2/D:/\_Work/myapp/application/modules/articles/views\\helpers/HeadTitle.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (D:\_Work\\;D:\\wamp\\;C:\\Windows\\Temp\\;c:\\php5\\pear) in D:\\wamp\\frameworks\\ZendFramework-1.10.2\\Zend\\Loader.php on line 190

So i think before somehow the error text got screwed before i pasted here.

So the error is still present...

Andrew Ballard posted a sample case on fw-general illustrating the problem (at least on Windows). I was to do myself a sample case but i think Andrew sample case is more than relevant, and very easy to reproduce so i am posting here:

Actually, it turned out to be pretty simple to build a test case:

testcase.php <?php define('LIBRARY\_PATH', realpath('D:\\\\Web Server\\\\wwwroot\\\\lib\\\\ZendFramework\\\\library\\\\1.10.1-no-require')); // Set the initial include\_path. You may need to change this to ensure that // Zend Framework is in the include\_path; additionally, for performance // reasons, it's best to move this to your web server configuration or php.ini // for production. set\_include\_path(implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, array( LIBRARY\_PATH, ))); error\_reporting(E\_ALL); ini\_set('display\_errors', 1); ini\_set('display\_startup\_errors', 1); /\*\* Zend\_Loader \*/ require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; // A Windows absolute file path for a file that does not exist $file = 'D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\MyApp\\application/controllers/helpers/Redirector.php'; $loader = new Zend\_Loader(); $result = $loader->isReadable($file); echo '$loader->isReadable(' . "'" . str\_replace('\\\\', '\\\\\\\\', $file) . "') === "; var\_dump($result); ?>

Expected result: $loader->isReadable('D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\MyApp\\application/controllers/helpers/Redirector.php') === bool(false)

Actual result: Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\ZendFramework\\library\\1.10.1-no-require/D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\MyApp\\application/controllers/helpers/Redirector.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (D:\\Web Server) in D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\ZendFramework\\library\\1.10.1-no-require\\Zend\\Loader.php on line 190 $loader->isReadable('D:\\Web Server\\wwwroot\\lib\\MyApp\\application/controllers/helpers/Redirector.php') === bool(false)

I've verified the reproduce case.

While this is not critical (the script will continue to work), it's clearly going to be an issue if you are running the code in production on a Windows machine. However, making the changes as suggested by the reporter do not remove the warning for me -- the warning remains exactly as before. I'll see if I can find a patch today, but at this point, I'm applying guesswork.

Matthew,

Does the proposed change I added in my comment on the related issue <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9263> help any? Basically, if you know the OS is Windows and the path being tested begins with a drive letter, then you also know that the path being tested is absolute and there is no point in iterating through the include paths.

These two seem to be the same.

Andrew: yes, I found the proposed change on ZF-9263, and that definitely works; as you'll note, I've added a unit test, and applied your fix. :)
