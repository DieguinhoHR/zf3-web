### Description

Although cascade deleting is executed from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::delete it will not delete from dependent table. While calling \_cascadeDelete on dependent table it's class name is passed as parent's table. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::delete should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function delete($where)
        {
            $depTables = $this->getDependentTables();
            if (!empty($depTables)) {
                $resultSet = $this->fetchAll($where);
                if (count($resultSet) > 0 ) {
                    foreach ($resultSet as $row) {
                        /**
                         * Execute cascading deletes against dependent tables
                         */
                        foreach ($depTables as $tableClass) {
                            $t = self::getTableFromString($tableClass, $this);
                            $t->_cascadeDelete(get_class($this), $row->getPrimaryKey());
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    
            $tableSpec = ($this->_schema ? $this->_schema . '.' : '') . $this->_name;
            return $this->_db->delete($tableSpec, $where);
        }
