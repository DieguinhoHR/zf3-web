### Description

Hi,

when outputting a Form using the XHTML-Standard Tags "br"s are outputted like this   
 which is correct from Standard viewpoint. Unfortunately the IE (in my case Version 7) has some standard misinterpretation because he interpretes the closing br as a whole br which results in double linebreaks. Therefore it would be nice if the \_getOpenTag and \_getCloseTag Methods of the class Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_HtmlTag would keep that in mind and outputting only a single   
 regadless of which type the documenttype is. I don't know if there are any other holes in the IE implementation, but this one can be done very fast.

I have corrected it by doing the following:

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Abstract

/\* Not a complete List\*/ protected $\_shorttags=array('br','img','input');

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_HtmlTag

 
    protected function _getOpenTag($tag, array $attribs = null)
    {
        $html='';
        if($tag!=''){
            $html = '<' . $tag;
            if (null !== $attribs) {
                $html .= $this->_htmlAttribs($attribs);
            }
            if(in_array($tag,$this->_shorttags)){
                $html.='/';
            }
            $html .= '>';
        }
        return $html;
    }
    
    protected function _getCloseTag($tag)
    {
        if($tag!='' && !in_array($tag,$this->_shorttags)){
            return '</' . $tag . '>';
        }
        return '';
    }
