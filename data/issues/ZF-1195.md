### Description

There is currently no way to force a connection to close in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. The implicit way is to destroy the adapter object, but in some cases this is not effective in closing the connection to the database.

For instance, in the case of the Zend\_Db unit tests, connections accumulate until they exceed the capacity of the RDBMS server.

Please implement a closeConnection() abstract method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Call this method in the tearDown() method of the unit tests. Users can also use this to manage connections more explicitly, though most often it is not necessary.
