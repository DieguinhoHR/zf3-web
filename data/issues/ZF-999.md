ZF-999: usePhpDateFormat() - str\_replace() does not work as expected by the code

### Description

1) PHP's 'w' format token specifier does not map to CLDR/ISO's 'eee' format specifier (off-by-one error)

2) ConvertPhpToIsoFormat() does not work because of how str\_replace() works on arrays. It translates one pair at a time. If the replacement occurs in a later search string, then replacement is performed again. Thus, the current implementation translates 'w' => 'eee' => 'zzzzzzzzzz'.

3) The testUsePhpDateFormat() unit test needs additional test cases.

Related to 1) CLDR/ISO does only support e and ee because there can not be more than 99 weekdays... The token 'eee' was added by me in extension to the CLDR format. Otherwise we would not be able to produce the expected output

The extensions of the CLDR format are ONLY for internal useage and could change anywhen if we are in need. Therefor I will not document these non-standard format tokens.

IF you are in need of for example leap year you should not use php's way date('L'); but instead use Zend\_Date's API ->isLeapYear() which is much more readable.
