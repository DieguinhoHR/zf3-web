### Description

Hi,

I've recently used the ZendFramework and I try to test all functionalities or at least, those I need !

When using the ActiveRecord Zend\_Db\_Table, I thought that it could be great to have an ActiveRecord working like RoR. For instance, a table Logs :

For the moment you have to do like following :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Logs();
    $log->insert(array(
        'level' => 'MONLEVEL',
        'message' => 'Hop un test'
    ));


And I'd rather like to do :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Logs();
    $log->level = 'MONLEVEL';
    $log->message = 'Hop un test';
    $log->insert();


In order to do that, I've changed the Zend\_Db\_Table like that :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function insert($data = null)
        {
            if ($data == null) {
                $data = array();
                foreach ($this->_cols as $col) {
                    if (!empty($this->{$col})) {
                        $data[$col] = $this->{$col}; 
                    }
                }
            }
            $this->_db->insert(
                $this->_name,
                $data
            );
            return $this->_db->lastInsertId();
        }


It could be great to externalize the function and to do it for update and delete ! What do you think about it ?

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

Zend\_Db\_Table already supports something very close to what you describe:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $log = new Logs();
    
    $logRow = $log->fetchNew();
    $logRow->level = 'MONLEVEL';
    $logRow->message = 'Hop un test';
    $logRow->save(); // performs insert() for new row
    
    $logRow->level = 'TUELEVEL';
    $logRow->save(); // performs update() for existing row


The Table and Row classes are separate, so you can perform save() either to insert or update a Row, you can instantiate a new Row object, you can have multiple Row objects in your app simultaneously, etc. It's more flexible.

Reworded summary.

The existing Row Data Gateway implementation provides similar functionality and is more flexible than the Ruby on Rails style of syntax. So we are not going to implement the RoR style.
