### Description

_Summary:_ When attempting to create a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_When instance from XML that contains a valueString attribute, the user receives the following error: ````

_Steps to Reproduce:_ 1. Create a new XML document containing a gd:when element with a valueString attribute. 2. Instantiate a new Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_When and populate it with the XML document created in Step 1.

_Expected Results:_ There should be no errors.

_Actual Results:_ Population fails with the error message listed above.

_Regression:_ Introduced in r5118, affects 1.0.0 RC2.

_Notes:_ I'm not sure why this wasn't noticed earlier. A test will be included for this in ZF-1593.

Fixed in my build, patch sent to rboyd for review.

Accidentally had 1.0.0 RC1 listed under regression. Changed to RC2.
