### Description

When generating a form the rendering generates code like this:

<

form name="quicksearch" id="quicksearch" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="#" method="post">

Problem is name is not allowed on xhtml1.0 strict, and even if doctype is set to XHTML1\_STRICT still name is used on form rendering...
