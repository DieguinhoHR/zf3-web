### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene query parser throws an exception if query doesn't conform to query language.

It's necessary to have an option to parse any user input without exceptions.

What would be the proposed behavior if this option were selected?

Query parsing exceptions are suppressed by default now. If query doesn't conform query language, then it's tokenized using current default analyzer and all tokenized terms are used for searching.

This behavior may be turned off by the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_QueryParser::dontSuppressQueryParsingExceptions();

Bookkeeping. Assigning all issues to the person that ultimately closed them.
