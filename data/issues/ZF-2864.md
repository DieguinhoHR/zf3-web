### Description

As API Doc says getLocale() should return a Zend\_Locale instance. Instead it returns a string like 'de\_DE'.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale = $translate->getLocale();
    Zend_Debug::dump(is_object($locale)); #returns false;
    Zend_Debug::dump(is_string($locale)); #returns true;
    $lang = $locale->toString();  #Fatal error: Call to a member function toString() on a non-object

But "de\_DE" is the locale.

A Zend\_Locale can be \* a object of type Zend\_Locale \* a locale definition string from Zend\_Locale

Both are true and valid... Every class which takes a locale must accepts both ways.

Changed the APIdoc to be consistent with the implementation.

I can't tell which version this was fixed for. Thomas, could you please add a rev number in the form rXXXX where X's are digits when you resolve the issue? Thanks.
