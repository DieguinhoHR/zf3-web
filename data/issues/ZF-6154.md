### Description

Hi

I have the following code in my subform:

$password = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Password('password');

$this->addElements(array( $password ));

$this->setElementDecorators(array( new Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper() ));

This is rendering the following TEXT input:

Instead of the expected PASSWORD input:

When I use:

$this->setElementDecorators(array( 'ViewHelper' ));

I need to be able to use Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper() as I have used addPrefixPath() to intentionally resolve decorators differently.

Regards Gavin Phaup
