ZF-3448: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quote() does not properly handle ENUM values...

### Description

The logic for quoting fields in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quote() is insufficient to address fields of type ENUM that employ numeric values, even when the explicit data type is passed as the second argument. For example, a field in SQL with type "ENUM('1','0','-1')" should always quote values, particularly numeric values, before assembling a query, but this _never_ occurs for numeric values, resulting with inaccurate queries. Casting the value of the field to string within PHP is a useful workaround for this issue, as Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract no longer treats it as a numeric value.

Zend\_Db doesn't appear to properly handle enumerated types at all!

In a call to db->update($table,$data,$where) any enumerated values are not written to the database even though the $data array contains values for the enumerated type fields. (the data values have been previously passed through db->quote() )

Same holds true for db->insert(), no enumerated types are written to the database

Database = MySql Driver/Adapter = Pdo\_Mysql

You're right to include your comment on this issue, then... MySQL silently ignores values for fields that it doesn't understand or don't match its field definitions... Try setting a too-long value to a VARCHAR field to see what I'm talking about...

Does this only affect ENUM's that contain numeric values for you? I don't notice the same behavior with TINYINT. I have a patch to extract and submit, if it will be reviewed.

Additional note. Actually a blank value is written to the database for an enumerated value. Create a table with a enum value that defaults to one of its allowed values. Insert a record to the table, without setting a value for the enum field. It will default to whatever you set it on the database. Now update the record, this time passing a value for the enum field. It will get overwritten with a blank.

David said "Does this only affect ENUM's that contain numeric values for you"

I tend not to use numeric values for enums so don't experience that particular issue. I use string values e.g.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `syst_test` ( `pid` int(11) NOT NULL auto\_increment, `uVal` int(11) NOT NULL, `strVal` varchar(30) default NULL, `dateVal` date default NULL, `textVal` text, `floatVal` float default NULL, `enumVal` enum('one','two') default NULL, `rowSts` enum('active','suspended','defunct') NOT NULL default 'active' COMMENT 'Row Status', `rowUid` int(11) NOT NULL default '0' COMMENT 'Last Edited By', `rowDt` timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP on update CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Edit Datetime', PRIMARY KEY (`pid`), UNIQUE KEY `uVal` (`uVal`) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO\_INCREMENT=10 ;

A little further delving seems to reveal that the Zend layer is doing everything you would expect. It properly puts quotes around an enum value. It is when the pdo layer is called to do the update that the value disappears. So it my be PDO, not Zend\_Db at fault. Can't debug PDO in Zend Studio, so can get no further :-(

We haven't had the issue you're describing with string values and ENUM fields at all, Ashley, only those fields that contain a numeric ENUM value. Our solution has just been to cast the number to a string value, ie :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    -- Sample Schema in Database 'test'
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 'enum_test' (
    'one_or_zero' ENUM('1','0') DEFAULT '1',
    'true_or_false' ENUM('true','false) DEFAULT 'false',
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8-bin ;
    
    INSERT INTO 'enum_test' VALUES 
    ( '1', 'true' ),
    ( '1', 'false' ),
    ( '0', 'true' ),
    ( '1', 'false' );


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $Adapter = Zend_Db::factory('Pdo_Mysql', array('host' => 'localhost', 'user' => 'root', 'dbname' => 'test');
    
    // Expected - integer: 2
    Zend_Debug::dump( 
        $Adapter->select()->from('enum_test', array('count' => 'COUNT(*)'))
            ->where('one_or_zero = ?', 1)
            ->query()->fetchColumn() 
    );
    // Actual - integer: 0
    
    // Expected - integer: 2
    Zend_Debug::dump( 
        $Adapter->select()->from('enum_test', array('count' => 'COUNT(*)'))
            ->where('one_or_zero = ?',  (string) 1)
            ->query()->fetchColumn()
    );
    // Actual - integer: 2


What you're describing - correct me if wrong - is something like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Same as above...
    
    // Expected - integer 1 (number of rows affected)
    Zend_Debug::dump(
        $Adapter->insert(array('true_or_false' => 'true'))
    );
    // Actual - integer 1
    
    // Expected - integer 3 (2 originals plus newly inserted value)
    Zend_Debug::dump(
        $Adapter->select()->from('enum_test', array('count' => 'COUNT(*)'))
            ->where('true_or_false = ?', 'true')
            ->query()->fetchColumn()
    );
    // Actual - integer 0 (query got messed up somewhere...!)


What's version of PHP you're using, as this may be the culprit instead.

I had a spare minute so I checked to see if anything different happened by changing the adapter to Mysqli. It didn't - still doen't work.

However just to prove it isn't MySql, I ran the following bare bones mysql query:

 
        $db = mysql_connect('localhost','MyDb','MyDb');
        $sql = "update syst_test set enumVal = 'two' where pid = 10";
        $ret = mysql_db_query('MyDb',$sql,$db);


That works just fine, the enum value gets updated.

So it's not SQL. If changing adapters proves anything, its not the adapter. Ergo it's Zend\_Db.

I'm using PHP 5.2.3

"$Adapter->insert(array('true\_or\_false' => 'true'))" Yep, that's about right

(got t go now - will catch up 2morrow.)

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

Can I just submit a patch for this issue?

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-12-21T12:55:19.000+0000

Yes, I would like to see a patch- do you have one that addresses this issue?

I have a patch for this issue, but as there are no tests for the Abstract class, I haven't run the tests on every driver. With some direction there, I could do so, however. Please advise. Thanks.

Can you attache the issue to this ticket?

I don't quite follow, Ralph. What do you mean by "attach the issue to this ticket"...?

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2011-02-17T17:34:11.000+0000

Ha, sorry. I mean patch. You said you had a patch for this issue.

David, can you post a patch for this issue, I urgently need it...

 

 

Posted by David Rogers (al\_the\_x) on 2011-03-07T09:11:11.000+0000

Leo,

I'll try to dig that up and send it your way. I think that I isolated the issue to Zend\_Db\_Table when I last worked on this, since only Table instances have the metadata about the column to know how to coerce the values. I originally tried to mod Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysql, but without the metadata... Anyway. I'll put a patch together this week.

David

Any progress on the patch?

Hello I'm experiencing the same problem with Zend 1.11.4 A temporary solution for users that can't wait for the patch is to use Zend\_Db\_Expr: $Adapter->insert(array('true\_or\_false' => new Zend\_Db\_Expr("'true'")))
