ZF-10565: Zend\_Console\_Getopt does not allow an option with name of "route"

### Description

I have the following in my code:

$options = new Zend\_Console\_Getopt( array( 'route|r=s' => 'Custom route of the action.' ) );

// ... $action\_route = $options->route;

var\_dump($action\_route);

Which when called like this: ./phpfile.php --route=text results in: string(0) ""

I'd expect: string(4) "text"

Changing the name of route to anything else(ie - froute) and everything works as expected. I am not sure what version of the zf this is, but below is from my Getopt.php

I apologize, please remove this, it was an issue with my particular code.
