I just found out that the SVN manual was already updated. However, the usage is still unclear. I understand that now, I only need one line to use all languages.

For example $translate = new Zend\_Translate('tmx', 'path/to/mytranslation.tmx', 'en'); will enable english but also all other languages declared in the tmx file. Is this correct?

If so, how do I access the other languages. If I use $translate->setLocale('fr'); without setting the additionnal language, I get the following exception: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Translate\_Exception' with message 'Language (fr) has to be added before it can be used.

With the current documentation, it is unclear for me if I am doing something wrong or if there is an issue.

The documentation already describes the useage. The manual at the homepage is updated with every release and can not be changed by us developers.

The issue mentioned by you within your code has been fixed 4 days ago (SVN 5426 23.06.2007 12:00)

When filling issues please always use the latest SVN release and check if the problem is still there or is already fixed...

If the issue is still there with the latest SVN release feel free to add a new issue / reopen this one. This helps us not to look for hours and then recognise that the issue is already fixed ;-)

It always helps us if people give additional informations as php version and svn release :-)
