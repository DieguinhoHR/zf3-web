### Description

The factory method has been changed which generates a strict standards message if extended like this: Strict Standards: Declaration of Giata\_Uri::factory() should be compatible with that of Zend\_Uri::factory()

Old:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    factory($uri = 'http')


New:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    factory($uri = 'http', $className = null)


The second argument could be implemented by func\_get\_args, too.

What can be done at this point? If we revert the signature change now, we'll still have a BC break - albeit among a smaller range of version numbers (1.10.5-1.12 instead of <1.10.5)
