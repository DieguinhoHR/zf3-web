This is not a bug. The documentation has been updated in both trunk and release-1.10 branches. However, the online documentation seems not to have been built from this. Since this is a problem on the Zend website, I will close this issue within 24hrs unless there are any objections. Note that Matthew is aware of this - I have no control over the online docs myself.

I've verified that it was in the release branch prior to the 1.10.7 release. I'm not sure why it's not on the site -- we actually build the manual from the latest release when we deploy a new release. I'll check into it.

Note that someone once claimed the manual hasn't been rebuilt for a few mini-releases. No idea if true, but hope you figure out how it generated from an old version on this occasion. I have believed it was just a case of me pipping the post with the commit.

Fixed on the site now, and also in our build tools.
