ZF-6961: Zend\_Reflection\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param too restrictive with spaces when parsing tags
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Many libraries (such as PHPUnit) use a variable number of spaces between tag and argument to that tag, to make it look like the strings are in columns.

Zend\_Reflection\_Docblock\_Tag\_Param will throw a Zend\_Reflection\_Exception in these cases, because the regex used to check only allows one space.

Set component and auto reassign

It seems to be duplicate of ZF-6726
