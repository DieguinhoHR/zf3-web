### Description

Perhaps obvious to most, but maybe not to some (i.e. me). If you attempt to addRoute() with a name that's already specified (e.g. 'default' or 'compat') then your new route will not work. Maybe a quick note in the docs.

Otherwise the default routes don't seem to get in the way so far.

Assigning to Martel, RewriteRouter author and maintainer. Not sure if this is a bug or a documentation issue.

Actually these are mentioned in the docs:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.rewriterouter.default-routes.html)

But I agree that overwriting the routes by using the same name should be more emphasized.

Note: If you register a new route with the same name then new route will take place of the older one. Not the other way around.
