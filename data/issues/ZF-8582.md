ZF-8582: Undocumented/unwanted behaviour for route requirements containing '|'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-18T07:54:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:40.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When specifying a requirement for a variable in a route to be one of two values via a 'pipe', a prefix of the first value, or a postfix of the last will match too.

Example: When a requirement set as 'view|edit', the values 'viewSet' and 'blablaedit' will also match.

Cause of problem: The string specified is passed through preg\_match('#^'. $requirement .'$#ui').

Solution: Add () around the string to be matched: preg\_match('#^('. $requirement .')$#ui'). This solution is more correct and predictable, however it will also break old code if it (ab)used this undocumented possibility to avoid the '^' & '$'.
