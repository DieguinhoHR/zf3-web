### Description

Currently there is no way using Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 to generate a time limited signed URL to access an object which has ACL\_PRIVATE rules set for that resource.

The equivalanet Amazon S3 PHPSDK class is

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
         * Gets the web-accessible URL for the Amazon S3 object or generates a time-limited signed request for
         * a private file.
         *
    */
    public function get_object_url(){}
