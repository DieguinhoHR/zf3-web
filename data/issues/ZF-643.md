### Description

Currently, the wiki uses an alphabetical sorting mechanism to sort child pages. This should be avoided in our manual wiki pages. One idea might be to autonumber our chapters when importing the pages from DocBook to Confluence. This autonumbering should be consistent with the autonumbering generated by DocBook, as can be seen on the [live manual](http://framework.zend.com/manual/)
