### Description

I have custom form elements that are optionally arrays.

If they are configured with isArray=true, it would be nice to ensure they really are arrays, to avoid typecasting values to arrays every time they're retrieved.

I propose changing Zend\_Form\_Element::isValid() from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
             if ($this->isArray() && is_array($valueFiltered)) {
                 array_walk_recursive($valueFiltered, array($this, '_filterValue'));
             } else {
                 $this->_filterValue($valueFiltered, $valueFiltered);
             }


to something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($this->isArray()) {
                if ($valueFiltered === null)
                    $valueFiltered = array();
    
            if (!is_array($valueFiltered))
                $valueFiltered = array($valueFiltered);
    
                array_walk($valueFiltered, array($this, '_filterValue'));
            } else {
                $this->_filterValue($valueFiltered, $valueFiltered);
            }


Would this break anything? It makes sense to me that if an element is declared as an array, it's value will always be an array.
