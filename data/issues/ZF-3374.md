### Description

Zend search lucene gives a fatal error occasionally when it can't delete an index file. An error occurs on Zend\\Search\\Lucene\\Storage\\Directory\\Filesystem.php on line 215.

The problem is probably with the statement

throw $e;

and this should be removed.

r8564 resolved the bug, but it has not been merged to 1.5.2 branch (as well as others regarding the same file) You can get a clean copy from trunk, 1.5.3 will integrate these patches ( 8564 to 8568 ), sorry about that.

Fixed for the release-1.5 branch with the [CS-9683](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=9683).
