### Description

Came upon this issue when I was attempting to make a post request to the URI "/index.cfm?fuseaction=login.process&Mytoken=5CD0FD8F-5FCC-4444-BCD5FF23660253038131626". Zend\_Http\_Client::post( ) ignores the query string altogether.

There's a completely new version of the Zend\_Http\_Client library in final development stages in the incubator. Please try to use the incubator Zend\_Http\_Client and see if this problem still occurs with the new version.
