After a quick review, it seems like the place where code meets the database is always in:

line 132~ish of Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php --

 
    /**
     * Special handling for PDO query().
     * All bind parameter names must begin with ':'
     *
     * @param string|Zend_Db_Select $sql The SQL statement with placeholders.
     * @param array $bind An array of data to bind to the placeholders.
     * @return Zend_Db_Pdo_Statement
     */
    public function query($sql, $bind = array())
    {
        if (is_array($bind)) {
            foreach ($bind as $name => $value) {
                if (!is_int($name) && !preg_match('/^:/', $name)) {
                    $newName = ":$name";
                    unset($bind[$name]);
                    $bind[$newName] = $value;
                }
            }
        }
        return parent::query($sql, $bind);
    }


Perhaps for granularity, all adapters should at the very least implement a query() that forwards the request to parent::query() and if errors occur, they should produce their own adapter flavored exception.

Thanks for the help! I see where this needs to happen.

As for granular exceptions, we don't currently have distinct exceptions for the diffrent PDO adapters. We only have distinct exceptions for non-PDO adapters (though I question why this is useful). So I would just re-throw a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception if we get a PDOException.

Thats fine, i saw that Db2/Exception existed, as did ORacle/Exception.php

The only reason i thought there might be a need for granular exceptions is so that if an exception had funky default messages (like the PDO [SQLSTATE]... prefix), a more friendly message could propagate down the stack to the caught DB/Exception.php type.. IE, there would be no more [SQLSTATE] #### stuff in the final caught Zend\_Db\_Exception::getMessage() output.

just some thoughts..

I plan to use a backend-neutral exception message, and "chain" the PDOException.

Cf. Zend\_Gdata\_HttpException.

That sounds like a winner. Thanks, Ralph

Set component to Zend\_Db.

As of revision 4202, the PDOException is now re-thrown as a Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception. The original PDOException is added to the new exception in a "chained" fashion, and is accessible via a method "getChainedException()".
