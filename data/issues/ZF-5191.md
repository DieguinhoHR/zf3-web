### Description

Zend\\Controller\\Router\* use urldecode() to decode URL params and return UTF-8 data. Zend\\Controller\\Action\\Helper\\Url.php ->assemble() use urlencode() to encode params from UTF-8

Need replace urldecode() at html\_entity\_decode() and urlencode() at htmlentities(), because some servers use alternate encoding... not UTF-8.

Perhaps other modules also use urldecode (), urlencode () Zend\\Http\\Client.php Zend\\Http\\Cookie.php

Updated to remove Zend\_Http components - these should not alter data from source outside of URL encoding/decoding. The interpretation of data is a concern for the end user of these components. Marked the remainder as an improvement (not a bug) until an additional review is made.
