### Description

Hi there,

When passing an https URI to Zend\_Http\_Client::setUri using the Socket adapter, it automatically chooses the sslv2:// stream type (lines 96 and 134 of Socket.php). I don't think this is the appropriate thing to do.

First, as stated by wez in [this bugreport](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=33192), the stream type ssl:// will automatically choose the appropriate version of the ssl protocol to use:

??Use ssl:// for automatic v2 or v3 support.??

Which would be better IMHO.

Now, what if I need/want to use tls encryption ? I think we need an explicit way to set the streaming type here (via the $config array maybe ?).

Hi,

The reason why sslv2:// is used by default is because some servers (without naming any ;) have a really bad implementation of sslv3 and the connection is not properly closed - so a warning is thrown by PHP, despite the fact that the data is properly recieved. When using ssl:// these servers presumably negotiate sslv3:// but cause warnings to be thrown.

I see no reason why there shouldn't be a configuration option to override the transport stream - I will look into it and try to add it as soon as I can.

This is now fixed in r. 2759 - you can now do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setUri("https://localhost/info.php");
    $client->setConfig(array(
        'ssltransport' => 'tls'
    ));
    
    $response = $client->request('GET');


As you can see, setting the 'ssltransport' config value will override the sslv2 stream transport layer.

Please do not close this bug yet - I will close it once I have documented this new feature.
