ZF-8128: Bootstrap

### Description

My application has a mul-modules structure.

/modules/article/Bootstrap.php /modules/blog/Bootstrap.php

there is a \_initDb function in each Bootstrap.php.

When I visit <http://localhost/article/> to execute article module, \_initDb of blog module was executed.

If I have 100 modules, each module has a initDb function. then will execute 100 \_initDb?

this is very inefficiency.

    protected function _initDb()
    {
        //...
    }
    
    protected function _initAutoloader()
    {
        $autoloader = new Zend_Application_Module_Autoloader(array(
            'namespace' => '',
            'basePath' => APPLICATION_PATH,
        ));
    
        return $autoloader;
    }

Why are you initializing a unique database connection in each module? I'd do this in your application bootstrap, and then do only module-specific initialization in your module bootstraps.

Second: your individual module bootstraps should extend Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap, which will negate the need for your \_initAutoloader() method (as this support is built-in).

I'm closing this as "not an issue"; the bootstrapping for the reporter's application should be modified to make better usage of resources and the design of the ZF bootstrap mechanisms.
