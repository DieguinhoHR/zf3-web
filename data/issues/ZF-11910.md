ZF-11910: Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta fatal error when no View object is set

### Description

$headmeta = new Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta(); $width = 320; $min\_scale = 1; $max\_scale = 1; $headmeta->headMeta()->appendName('viewport',"$width, minimum-scale=$min\_scale, maximum-scale=$max\_scale, user-scalable=no");

This is part of source code of My\_Controller\_Plugin\_DevicePresets extends Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract, so it's a plugin controller. Running this code causes a fatal error: Fatal error: Call to a member function doctype() on a non-object in ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\View\\Helper\\HeadMeta.php on line 212.

Which is (roughly):

if (!$this->view->doctype()->isRdfa()

I noticed this bug when decided to update ZF lib from 1.11.2 to 1.11.6, and that it's also there with latest release.

The Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta class requires an instance of Zend\_View, and does not adequately check to ensure one is provided before trying to call other view helpers. I would either pull the instance of Zend\_View from your application and inject it into HeadMeta...but passing in a new instance works too:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $headmeta = new Zend_View_Helper_HeadMeta();
    $headmeta->setView(new Zend_View());
    ...


I think the view helper should be updated to do the above automatically if no Zend\_View instance is provided to the helper before it's used.

I worked around it by rolling back ZF library to 1.11.2 and this is my main issue here - is that a change i have missed (and if it is, then why helper doesn't throw an exception about missing view before error strikes?) or just an error somewhere? I don't really have the time to do a regression test and check where the problem lays.

The code causing the issue (call to $this->view->doctype()->isRdfa()) was added in 1.11.3 (see ZF-9743), and so any use of Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta without first providing a Zend\_View object is broken since that release.

The simplest fix is this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Index: library/Zend/View/Helper/HeadMeta.php

             }
    
             //  is only supported with doctype RDFa
    -        if (!$this->view->doctype()->isRdfa()
    +        if ( !is_null($this->view) && !$this->view->doctype()->isRdfa()
                 && $item->type === 'property') {
                 return false;
             }


If there is no view then there is no doctype to parse, and so we have to assume it's HTML (and not RDF) so we can safely short-circuit that if statement in this case. I'll work up a more complete fix w/ unit tests when I get a chance.

Attached patch which protects helper against calls to $this->view when no view has been provided.
