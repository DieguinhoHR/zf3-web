### Description

If you load a file into a Zend\_Config\_Ini object while passing null or no second parameter as the second parameter, method getSectionNames() will return null, although all sections will be laoded.

In fact, what it returns is what you pass in, you pass in 'Admin', it will probably retun 'Admin', if you pass in array('Admin', 'Frontend'), it will probably return array('Admin', 'Frontend').

Point is, it should not just echo back what you pass in if null is passed. Because null means all sections, getSectionNames() should return an array of all section names if there are more than one and a string sectionName if there is only one section.

Not sure wether to call this a bug or an improvement, so I will stick to improvement for now.

I need this functionality to be able to add sections that are not necessarily known in advance to the code, so they must not be hardcoded. I want to do something for each loaded section and reuse the name when saving new settings for each section. If there is a workaround, other than using multiple files and scandir() I would like to know.

Hmm... getSectionName() doesn't work and I doubt it's worked since 1.0!

Thinking some more about this, there's no way that Zend\_Config can know what the loaded sections are as that information is in Zend\_Config\_Ini and not Zend\_Config.

If you then take into account that a Zend\_Config object may have been merged or loaded via an array, what information should getSectionName() return?

My current thinking is that getSectionName() and areAllSectionsLoaded() should be marked deprecated and removed in 2.0.

I suspect that you should be using Zend\_Config\_Writer.

I've studied a bit more now, especially the test method testZF414() and ZF-414.

getSectionName() intentionally returns null if all sections are loaded so you can distinguish between this case and when multiple, but not all sections have been loaded.

If you get null from getSectionName, then you can do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sections =  array_keys($config->toArray());


to get all the sections in the file.

Thanks for the tip! This will help to solve my case.

However, I still think the behavior is a bit unexpected, especially because we have allSectionsLoaded() to determine wether all sections are loaded.
