### Description

With PHP 5.2.5 and PHPUnit 3.2.15 on Linux I get the following failures from running phpunit --verbose AllTests (under the default test configuration) in trunk/tests:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    1) test__toString(Zend_Controller_Response_HttpTest)
    Failed asserting that  is true.
    /home/darby/framework/trunk/tests/Zend/Controller/Response/HttpTest.php:179
    
    2) testCanSendHeadersIndicatesFileAndLine(Zend_Controller_Response_HttpTest)
    Failed asserting that  matches PCRE pattern "/headers already sent in .+, line \d+$/".
    /home/darby/framework/trunk/tests/Zend/Controller/Response/HttpTest.php:255

I can also reproduce the failures by running phpunit Zend\_Controller\_Response\_HttpTest, see [SVN r8477](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=8477).

I can also reproduce the same failures, though with different line numbers, on WinXP, PHP 5.1.4.

both tests rely on Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract's usage of header(), headers\_sent() and headers\_list() to be able to successfully test their correct behavoir.

Unfortunately, in PHP's Cli sapi, the calls to header() are ignored thus content provided via this method cannot be tested. Also, since there is usage of output buffereing during unit tests (and in some cases, the actual component), headers\_sent() 's state will not become true until some output is sent to the cli console.

This is the best we can do until we find an alternative means to test differnet php sapis or hijack php extension function calls (like header()).
