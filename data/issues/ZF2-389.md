### Description

Hi Matthew,

I heard from Ben Scholzen that you're the master of the documentation. :) I have a minor or trivial improvement which could make things a lot easier. Whenever I search via Uncle Google for a Class Name I get directed to the Reference Doc, this is good and well, but sometimes (and an awful amount of sometimes) I need the API Doc for the Class.

It would be enormously helpful, if I could just click on a link and get to the exact entry in the API doc.

Please consider if this could be done, it would certainly help a good number of devs who are way to lazy to search. ;)

No thoughts about it? Is my explanation not good enough? Input please.
