ZF-2472: Can't set SubForm's fieldset legend with Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset

### Description

Hello,

I hope I'm not mistaken, but there doesn't seem to be a way of setting fieldset legends (I was using it with a subform, but I think it's generally a problem with fieldset decorator), I've looked at the code and it seems a problem with Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset as it doesn't handle the case when the element doesn't have a getLegend(). I think handling it would be to simply not set $attribs['legend'] as that overrides the existing legend (if it's set) by null.

Thank you and please forgive me if I missed something obvious

Currently, Zend\_Form (and, by extension, Zend\_Form\_SubForm) has a setLegend() method -- i.e., all major class types now have the method. I see no reason to pass the legend in the attribs at this point.

This is no longer an issue in current trunk.
