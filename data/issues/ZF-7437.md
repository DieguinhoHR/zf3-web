### Description

When extending Zend\_Rest\_Controller you are required to define the index, get, post, put, and delete actions.

Yet Zend\_Rest\_Route attempts to call the non-existent 'listAction' in the following block of code in match():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                // Check for leading "special get" URI's 
                $specialGetTarget = false;
                if ($pathElementCount && array_search($path[0], array('index', 'new')) > -1) { 
                    $specialGetTarget = array_shift($path);
                } elseif ($pathElementCount == 1) {
                     $params['id'] = array_shift($path);
                } elseif ($pathElementCount == 0 || $pathElementCount > 1) {
                    $specialGetTarget = 'list';
                }


This results in the following exception and trace:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Exception information:
    
    Message: Action "list" does not exist and was not trapped in __call()
    Stack trace:
    
    #0 /Users/hobodave/dev/php/blog/library/Zend/Controller/Action.php(515): Zend_Controller_Action->__call('listAction', Array)
    #1 /Users/hobodave/dev/php/blog/library/Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php(289): Zend_Controller_Action->dispatch('listAction')


The documentation doesn't mention any 'listAction', which leads me to believe the correct solution is to change 'list' to 'index'.

Attached patch creating a new unit test to cover this, as well as the fix.

I'm using rest services implementing Zend\_Rest\_Controller as action controller. The service interface lacks the used listAction. Fixing this problems maybe needs also changes in the service interface (listAction()....)

Hey guys ... sorry for the delay.

I'll get started on this and the other Zend\_Rest bugs ASAP.

thanks, -L
