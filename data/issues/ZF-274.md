### Description

Sample code:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    function test()
    {
        $db = Zend::registry('db');
        try {
            $result = $db->query('CALL sp()')->fetchAll();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            ....
        }
        
        return $result; 
    }


Processing hangs up on each n'th request depending on result set length. There's no same problem with SELECT queries.

Can you provide enough information and code to duplicate this problem on another system? Thanks!

This is a bug in libmysql. It is not a bug in Zend Framework. It also affects mysqli and PDO libraries that execute prepared statements against MySQL.

See: <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=22001>

Not a bug in Zend Framework code. We cannot fix it.
