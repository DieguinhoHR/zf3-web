I currently cannot duplicate, scheduling for later in the week.

My run is as follows:

~/Projects/code-zendframework/repo-trunk/tests$ phpunit -d short\_open\_tag=Off Zend\_Layout\_LayoutTest PHPUnit 3.2.11 by Sebastian Bergmann.

......................................

Time: 0 seconds

OK (38 tests)

I cannot reproduce the issue either, using 5.2.5, 5.2.4, or 5.2.3.
