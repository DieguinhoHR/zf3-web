ZF-12481: PDO Connections to MS-SQL Server using wrong SQL syntax.
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-12-03T13:52:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-12-03T14:08:54.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

All PDO-Connections to SQL-Server are using the SQL92-Platform-Syntax.

This is done by \\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter.php in the function createPlatformFromDriver.

So in example a simple query to a MS-SQL-Database looks like this an causes an error:

SELECT "Tablename".\* FROM "Tablename"

The "native" Driver "SqlServer" for Microsoft-SQL-Server can only be used on windows platforms. This is not applicable in most cases.
