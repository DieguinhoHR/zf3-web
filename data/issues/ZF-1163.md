ZF-1163: PDO is forcing attribute case to lower

### Description

Inside the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract, I found the following line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_connection->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_CASE, PDO::CASE_LOWER);


Not all the users want attribute case to be lower. Upper and natural are other good choices. It would be good if attribute case could be one member of the "config" member of the class. The case type would be removed from the array before building the connection DSN string. The default value could be PDO::CASE\_LOWER, but then the developers would have a better way to change it without having to extend the framework's classes or always call setAttribute before creating a connection.

Important: if this can be done with attribute case, why not define a whole set of PDO attributes upon class construct?

Best regards

This issue is similar to ZF-50.

Changed case mapping mode to CASE\_NATURAL in revision 4111. This was included in ZF 0.9.1.

Resolving this issue as a duplicate of ZF-50.

The secondary question in this issue is also covered in ZF-285.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
