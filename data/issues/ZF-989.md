### Description

If I send an email with a single To: address using Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail it sends the same email twice.

This seems to be caused by duplicate To: headers. For instance, a sampling of the headers may look like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    To: 
    Subject: Subject goes here
    From: "User" 
    To: 
    Content-Type: multipart/alternative; charset="iso-8859-1";
     boundary="=_6e1345cd6d0e8711c3affdf659433023"
    MIME-Version: 1.0


I believe this is caused by the destination email address being supplied twice to mail(): as the first argument of mail(), and as one of the headers in the fourth argument of mail().

I am seeing this problem with PHP 5.2.0.
