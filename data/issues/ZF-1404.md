### Description

The file /tests/Zend/Db/TestUtil/Pdo/Pgsql.php contains SQL syntax like DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS.

The IF EXISTS syntax was introduced in PostgreSQL 8.2. It is not recognized in earlier versions of PostgreSQL.

Please change the TestUtil class to use a more generic solution for conditional DDL operations. It is likely that we can use the system catalog. Query the pg\_class relation and find out if tables and sequences exist. Create or drop these schema objects based on what you find. This solution works well for TestUtil classes for Oracle and DB2.
