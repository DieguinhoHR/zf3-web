### Description

This is extremely minor, but could save someone 15 or so minutes if they cut and paste stuff like I do:

In the second code example under the "Testing your Controllers and MVC Applications" header on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.test.phpunit.html), line 28 needs to have all of XML capitalized in the header value, because Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract::isXmlHttpRequest() compares the header with "XMLHttpRequest":

Line 28 Currently is: $this->request->setHeader('X-Requested-With', 'XmlHttpRequest'); Line 28 Needs to be: $this->request->setHeader('X-Requested-With', 'XMLHttpRequest');
