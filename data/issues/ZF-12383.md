### Description

There is an "f" just before <?php in Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Deleted.

It appears this bug has occurred previously and was fixed but has cropped back up as of: Zend Framework 1.11.13 Minimal Released 2012-08-20

If a unit test was added to utilize zend feed reader to verify the output of zend feed writer this issue wouldn't happen again.
