ZF-1900: Zend\_Mail\_Part - problems with headers
-------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-08-31T15:56:28.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:28:46.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.2 (25/Sep/07)

### Description

I'm reciving lot of emails with mixed case headers. In Zend\_Mail\_Part there is a code that compare headers to find sth like 'multipart/' , 'boundary' , it works fine when header are lower case, but not working at all with uppercase headers.

For eg. in one message I've got that: MULTIPART/MIXED; BOUNDARY="0-1804289383-1188485096=:24518

Detection of multipart message with Zend\_Mail\_Part::isMultipart() fails.

The solution was simple: [code] public function isMultipart() { try { $this->contentType = strtolower($this->contentType); return strpos(strtolower($this->contentType), 'multipart/') === 0; } catch(Zend\_Mail\_Exception $e) { return false; } }

[/code]

Another problem I encountered was with subject - there should be autodetection/autodecoding of QuotedPrintable encoding on accessing $mail->subject (and other headers).

the solution was not as simple as I thought. The following changes helps. Its a quick fix - the problem still exist for multi case strings (for eg. upper case first notation 'Boundary')

[code]

 
    public function isMultipart()
    {
        try {
            return strpos(strtolower($this->contentType), 'multipart/') === 0;
        } catch(Zend_Mail_Exception $e) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    
    
    protected function _cacheContent()
    {
        // caching content if we can't fetch parts
        if ($this->_content === null && $this->_mail) {
            $this->_content = $this->_mail->getRawContent($this->_messageNum);
        }
    
        if (!$this->isMultipart()) {
            return;
        }
    
        // split content in parts
        $boundary = Zend_Mime_Decode::splitContentType($this->contentType, 'boundary') ;
        if (!$boundary) {
            $boundary = Zend_Mime_Decode::splitContentType($this->contentType, 'BOUNDARY') ;
        }
        if (!$boundary) {
    
            throw new Zend_Mail_Exception('no boundary found in content type to split message');
        }
        echo "\tboundary:" . $boundary;
        $parts = Zend_Mime_Decode::splitMessageStruct($this->_content, $boundary);
        $counter = 1;
        foreach ($parts as $part) {
            $this->_parts[$counter++] = new self(array('headers' => $part['header'], 'content' => $part['body']));
        }
    }


[/code]

The content-type problem has been fixed in ZF-1847 (1.0.2 & 1.1.0)

all field/parameter names are now also lowercased (as are header names) and matched case-insensitive
