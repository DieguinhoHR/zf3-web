ZF-7937: Translate helper doesn't apply "options" if no translator is defined
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When no translator is defined,

translate("this is a string %s", $string);

does not work, because it returns the $messageid itself. If no translator is defined, Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate::translate() should return

vsprintf($messageid, $options) to avoid this problem.

But translate returns the messageid as is, which is expected behaviour.

When you have no option defined you will get a warning with your change which is more problematic than knowing that no translator is attached.
