### Description

Feedback from mailing list:

Please implement a method to explicitly close resources (file handles, Db connections) in Zend\_Log\_Writer classes.

It won't matter for 99% of users, but since ZF can be used CLI and potentially for long-lived apps, it probably wouldn't hurt to use an explicit close.
