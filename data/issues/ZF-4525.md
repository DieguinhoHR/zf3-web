### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Int will generate zeros as defaultvalues on form elements using the filter. This is since their default value "" (empty string) will get translated into 0.

A workaround for this could be something like this (although I don't know if that would break some other component, relying on Zend\_Filter\_Int, if so perhaps another argument would be better).

class My\_Filter\_Int implements Zend\_Filter\_Interface { /\*\* \* Defined by Zend\_Filter\_Interface \* \* Returns (int) $value \* \* @param string $value \* @return integer \*/ public function filter($value) {  
 if ($value) { return (int) ((string) $value); } return $value; } }
