ZF-9430: Zend\_Form issue on setName() all elements
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Sub-task Created: 2010-03-16T02:24:06.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-22T13:38:42.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I want to change the name of every element in my form by adding a prefix. Below you can see the code that I used in my controller.

{Code} //Code in controller $form = new Zend\_Form(); $txtField = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('txtElement'); $form->addElement($txtField);

$elements = $form->getElements(); foreach($elements as $element){ $element->setName('search\_'.$element->getName()); }

$this->view->form = $form; {Code}

Now I expect that every element in my form has the prefix 'search\_'. It works fine for the textfield itself and the dt elements but there's a problem with the dd element that doesn't change. Below you can see the html output.

{Code} //output html

    ==>here I expect "search\_txtElement-element" {Code}

This cannot work at the moment as the id is set up for Zend\_Decorator\_HtmlTag in Zend\_Form\_Element::loadDefaultDecorators() when constructing the element.

Fixed in trunk and sheduled for next minor release. See parent ZF-6741.
