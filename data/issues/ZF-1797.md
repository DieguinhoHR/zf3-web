### Description

$time = time(); $params = array( new Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_DateTime($time) ); $result = $client->call('foo.bar', $params);

In Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request::\_getXmlRpcParams() is parameter converted (damaged) via Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value::getXmlRpcValue to empty array.

This patch should solve this issue. UnitTests passed OK on this.

Applied in trunk and release branch, with a corresponding unit test. Oddly, the test ran with or without the patch; I'll look at it in more detail later.
