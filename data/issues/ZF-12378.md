### Description

Probably just a typo, but Zend\_Service\_Rackspace::getBackupSchedule() refers to an undeclared variable (line 1006) to get response contents.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    case '203':
      $backup = json_decode($result->getBody(),true);
      return $image['backupSchedule'];
    case '503':
    ....
