### Description

A query which has a column named 'description' and is ordered by it 'description DESC' will be broken if limited.

The query is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $columns = array('name', 'description');
    $order = 'description DESC';
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select($database);
    $select->from('usertable', $columns);
    $select->order($order);
    $select->limitPage(1, 10);
    
    $database->fetchAll($select);


Then I get an error... Looking into the created select statement I get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT * FROM (SELECT TOP 10 * FROM (SELECT TOP 10 "description", "name" 
    >FROM mytable ORDER BY "description" DESC ) AS inner_tbl ORDER BY "ription" 
    ASC ) AS outer_tbl ORDER BY "ription" desc


This behaviour can be seen within MSSQL where no native limit exists. Possibly same problem when using any column name where "asc" is included.
