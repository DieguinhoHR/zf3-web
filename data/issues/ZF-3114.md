### Description

I'm just gonna give an example. Please delete/close this if I'm wrong.

my current code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if($photo->albumId    != $albumId)    $photo->albumId = $albumId;
    if($photo->name        != $name)    $photo->name = $name;
    $photo->save();

better code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $photo->albumId = $albumId;
    $photo->name = $name;
    $photo->save();

fix required: in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract old:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __set($columnName, $value)
    {
        $columnName = $this->_transformColumn($columnName);
        if (!array_key_exists($columnName, $this->_data)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Row/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception("Specified column \"$columnName\" is not in the row");
        }
        $this->_data[$columnName] = $value;
        $this->_modifiedFields[$columnName] = true;
    }

new:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __set($columnName, $value)
    {
        $columnName = $this->_transformColumn($columnName);
        if (!array_key_exists($columnName, $this->_data)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Db/Table/Row/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Db_Table_Row_Exception("Specified column \"$columnName\" is not in the row");
        }
        
        if($this->_data[$columnName] != $value) {
            $this->_data[$columnName] = $value;
            $this->_modifiedFields[$columnName] = true;
        }
    }

This is not tested. Just to make clear what I want.

version: trunk 9228

// edit: made code readable // edit2: second attempt :D

This is not an issue; if you examine the code of \_doUpdate(), you'll see that this functionality already exists. For example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
            /**
             * Compare the data to the modified fields array to discover
             * which columns have been changed.
             */
            $diffData = array_intersect_key($this->_data, $this->_modifiedFields);


Please feel free to reopen if I have missed something. :)

array\_intersect\_key() does not evaluate the value at all. I just checks the keys. [http://de.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.array-intersect-key.php)

and ``` is just "true" anyway

so I think whats happening is that doUpdate updates all fields, even if value was "changed" but remains the same.

maybe you didn't understood my point. I was saying that when sql returns me a "name=fritz" and I do tableRow->name = "fritz" than I did _not_ change the value - no need to include it into doUpdate()

I see now; thanks for clarifying this. :)

It's a little more complicated than a simple '!='. For example, we must differently manage 'null', '', 'false' and '0'.

See <http://mikaelkael.fr/ZF-3114.php> for a first try. We must read by lines (not by columns).
