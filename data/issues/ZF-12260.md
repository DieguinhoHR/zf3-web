### Description

Hello! I've written a simple form connexion (login + password). After performing a if (!$form->isValid($formData)) i would like to display the form and the errors. All i get is "An error occured - Error!" coming from the ErrorController.

Doc is not quite explicit about that.

Thank you.

Add these 2 lines of code to your "application.ini" and you will see the errors:

 
    <pre class="highlight">resources.frontcontroller.throwExceptions          = 1
    resources.frontcontroller.params.displayExceptions = 1

Please use for all other question the [mailing lists](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Mailing+Lists), because this is a bug tracker and not a forum!
