### Description

On line 253 in Zend\\Db\\Db the string "FAILED TO FIND $adapterName\\n"; is printed.

Afterwards the execution is stopped although it should throw a Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Exception to enable handling this error properly.

I can not find the string commented in trunk.

I just double checked that the problem still exists in the repository.

Maybe I should point out that this ticket refers to _ZF2_ (therefore it is set to "affects next major release")?

Hi, Alexsander. Do you mean the string "FAILED TO FIND" exists in [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db) ?

I will be happy if You would tell me using version and exactly file name in your environment.
