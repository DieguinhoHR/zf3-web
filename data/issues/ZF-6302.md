The "init()" method of resources is what the bootstrap calls. Initialization of a resource is intended to occur here.

Additionally, please check to see that you have the most current revision -- getView() now initializes the view and passes options to it; init() retrieves the view from there.

Thank, for you answer, but i'm confused with init method , on framework is used as a complement of construct method.
