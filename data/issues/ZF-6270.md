### Description

Using ZendFramework 1.8.0PR (alpha1)

The API for \_loadTranslationData() has changed from returning nothing (void) to returning something. This change is not documented anywhere and breaks any defined classes which extend Zend\_Translate\_Adapter, for example Database-based translation.

Any class still returning nothing generates the following warnings:

 
    <pre class="highlight">Warning: array_keys() [function.array-keys]: The first argument should be an array in /home/purpleankh/project/ZendFramework-1.8.0PR/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 467
    
    Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/purpleankh/project/ZendFramework-1.8.0PR/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 468

If this API change is intentional, please document what needs to be returned from the method.

API doc fixed with r14845

Note: The behaviour of translation has not changed to before. The notice has no effect in the way the translaiton works.
