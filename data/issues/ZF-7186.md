### Description

For some reason, search results are quite different when the 'license' attribute is required, even when it is set to 'all'. When I removed the lines 840 and 841 from Yahoo.php, the search results were the same as what I got using the yahoo website. Otherwise the results were rather obscure and meaningless.
