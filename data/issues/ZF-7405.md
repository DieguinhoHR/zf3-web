### Description

According to the jsonRPC specification for jsonrpc version 2.0 you are allowed to pass a batch list of calls. [http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/json-rpc/web/json-rpc-1-2-proposal?pli=1) Section 6.

Given the example on the specification and stepping through the code I receive the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [ {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "sum", "params": [1,2,4], "id": "1"},
          {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "notify_hello", "params": [7]},
          {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subtract", "params": [42,23], "id": "2"},
          {"foo": "boo"},
          {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "foo.get", "params": {"name": "myself"}, "id": "5"},
          {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_data", "id": "9"} ]


Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $request = new Zend_Json_Server_Request();
    $request->loadJson($_POST['request']);


Which eventually gets to /Zend/Json/Server/Request.php method setOptions with options being an array with the 5 methods Line #76 does a "foreach ($options...) assuming that $options is the JSON request but it is not.
