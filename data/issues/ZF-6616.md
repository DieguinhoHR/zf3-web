### Description

According to documentation "isNumber($value, array $options = array()) checks if a given string is a number and returns true or false. ". I tested it with an empty value and it returns a TRUE value. But empty string isn't a localized number.

I can not reproduce this with the actual release.

Can you give some more details ?

Calling

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Locale_Format::isNumber('');


returns me false which is expected behaviour.

I had to update my library to 1.8.0 (I'd want to avoid this) and now it works correctly. I searched about this bug fix before submitting this issue, i didn't find anything so I thought that it hadn't been already discovered. Sorry, thank you for your very fast reply.
