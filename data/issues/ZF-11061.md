### Description

The manual's requirements page lists ext/mcrypt as a hard dependency of Zend\_Service\_Recaptcha.

There's no mention or usage of mcrypt in the "normal" Zend\_Service\_Recaptcha code. It appears that mcrypt is only required if you use the Zend\_Service\_ReCaptcha\_MailHide sub-component.

So, it seems like the requirements page should either list mcrypt as a "Soft" dependency, or as a hard dependency on the MailHide sub-component.

The committed change fixes the problem in requirements-php-extensions-table.xml, but not the reverse problem in requirements-zendcomponents-table.xml.
