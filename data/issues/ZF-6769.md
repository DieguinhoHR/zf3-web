### Description

I try to create Zend\_Date object from array:

$date\_array = array( 'year'=>2009, 'month'=>5, 'day'=>'21' ); $date = new Zend\_Date( $date\_array );

In debugger I went to line in Zend\_Date constructor: ... // set datepart if (($part !== null && $part !== self::TIMESTAMP) or (!is\_numeric($date))) { // switch off dst handling for value setting $this->setUnixTimestamp($this->getGmtOffset()); ...

Inside the getGmtOffset method I enter into the method getDateParts in line $date = $this->getDateParts($this->getUnixTimestamp(), true);

Method getUnixTimestamp returns an empty string because parameter $this->\_unixTimestamp is null, because it's only constructor. So in method getDateParts we get to the line: ... // 32bit timestamp if (abs($timestamp) <= 0x7FFFFFFF) { return @getdate($timestamp); } ... and when $timestamp=='' the function getdate is called. Then we returns into method getGmtOffset to the line $offset = $this->mktime($date['hours'], $date['minutes'], $date['seconds'], $date['mon'], $date['mday'], $date['year'], false) - $this->mktime($date['hours'], $date['minutes'], $date['seconds'], $date['mon'], $date['mday'], $date['year'], true);

All elements in $date are null. $offset is always equal to zero. Something wrong with it.....

Instead of writing this long debugging description it would be interesting to know what obviously your problem is.

Additionally informations about your system are required for detailed reproduction

My problem is that my application works slowly in Zend\_Date constructor in compare to Zend Framework 1.7.8, when I create it from the array. My system is: php 5.2.9-2 Windows Vista x64 SP1 Core 2 Duo E7200 4 GB DDR2 Zend Studio 6.1.2

And what has your message about "wrong argument" to do with performance ? I don't see how this should be equal or rely to each other.

Have you read the performance chapters of ZF ? Which locale are you using ? Which locale was requested ? What's your systems timezone ? Have you set the default timezone ? Have you set any options ? Have you tested performance with or without debugging ? How did you compare this two releases ? Have you changed something else ?

PS: I have the feeling like you said "my car is broken", I asked "what's wrong" and you said "it has only a 1,6L engine"... I think you know what I mean.
