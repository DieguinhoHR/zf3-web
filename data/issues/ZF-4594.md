### Description

Subselect queries as columns does not supported in current implementation of Zend\_Db\_Select

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $imprSubSelect = $this->getAdapter()->select();
    $imprSubSelect->from(array('I' => 'IMPRESSIONS'), array('IMPR_CNT' => 'COUNT(*)'))
                          ->where('I.CAR_ID = "C".CAR_ID');
                
    $select = $this->getAdapter()->select();
    $select->from(array('C' => $this->_name), 
              array('CAR_ID',
                'MANUFACTURER', 
                'IMPR_CNT' => $imprSubSelect))        
        ->where('DEALER_ID = ?', $dealer->getId());


This select object generate incorrect sql code.

To improve this column object type checking need to be added to \_renderColumns method.

Old version:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($column instanceof Zend_Db_Expr) {
      $columns[] = $this->_adapter->quoteColumnAs($column, $alias, true);
    }


New version:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($column instanceof Zend_Db_Expr || $column instanceof Zend_Db_Select) {
      $columns[] = $this->_adapter->quoteColumnAs($column, $alias, true);
    }

Shouldnt the select object be wrapped inside a Zend\_Db\_Expr object to work as a subselect?

Ie:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $imprSubSelect = $this->getAdapter()->select();
    $imprSubSelect->from(array('I' => 'IMPRESSIONS'), array('IMPR_CNT' => 'COUNT(*)'))
                          ->where('I.CAR_ID = "C".CAR_ID');
                
    $select = $this->getAdapter()->select();
    $select->from(array('C' => $this->_name), 
              array('CAR_ID',
                'MANUFACTURER', 
                'IMPR_CNT' => new Zend_Db_Expr($imprSubSelect)))
        ->where('DEALER_ID = ?', $dealer->getId());

Yes, it can we wrapped, but I think that pass Zend\_Db\_Select object as a parameter is easier to use. I spent about an hour to identify this issue, because I thought this functionality is already built in ZF.

There are only 2 classes, which can produce SQL code - Zend\_Db\_Expr and Zend\_Db\_Select itself. I think that adding the second condition to the "if" statement is acceptable solution.

Ok, I can see the use case. One question: should it ensure that the select object being passed in is not a reference to the object in question itself?

Ie: should we prevent this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->from(array(..., 'C' => $select));

Its a good point. I have just tested it and got recursive call of the _renderColumns_ method.

Here is sample code, which produces the error

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()
                             ->from('dual');
                 
    $select->columns(array('c1' => new Zend_db_Expr('2'), 'c2' => $select));    


Also, I have found out the same issue, in the \_\_join\_ method (773 line). In this case _assemble_ method called recursively and PHP interpreter fails.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select()
                 ->from('dual');
                 
    $select->join($select, '1=1');


I think, this issue will also appears when several select objects references to each other.
