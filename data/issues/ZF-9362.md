### Description

Hi, I think that in class Zend\_Log in factory function should be instead of this code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!is_array(current($config))) {
      $log->addWriter(current($config));
    } else {
      foreach($config as $writer) {
        $log->addWriter($writer);
      }
    }


this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!is_array(current($config))) {
      $log->addWriter(current($config));
    } else {
      foreach(current($config) as $writer) {
        $log->addWriter($writer);
      }
    }


With this bug it is impossible to add more writers using Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Log.

If I am wrong, please tell me how to solve it by other way. Thanks.

Sorry, i've realized that my ZF release is somehow mixed up from various versions which caused these problems. Sorry for interrupting, delete this issue please.
