ZF-5084: Zend\_Session::rememberMe() ALWAYS calls Zend\_Session::regenerateId()

### Description

At the end of Zend\_Session::rememberUntil()

 
       // normally "rememberMe()" represents a security context change, so should use new session id
        self::regenerateId();
    }


I believe this may be the case in many circumstances, but if I want to extend the cookie lifetime, it is not currently possible without regenerating the sessionId which is not something that _always_ needs to happen.

Maybe an extra parameter to rememberMe and rememberUntil that defaults to regeneration so the caller can decide if its appropriate to regenerate?
