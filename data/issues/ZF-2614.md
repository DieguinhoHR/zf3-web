### Description

I use findDependentRowset for each Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract object of my fetchAll query. Since 1.5 version, the sql queries are wrong if I add the third parameter.

I logged the queries via the profiler :

Without third parameter : SELECT `photos_article`.`id_photo`, `photos_article`.`path`, `photos_article`.`article_id` FROM `photos_article` WHERE (`article_id` = 1)

- - - - - -

SELECT `photos_article`.`id_photo`, `photos_article`.`path`, `photos_article`.`article_id` FROM `photos_article` WHERE (`article_id` = 2) ........

With third parameter (see code below) : SELECT `photos_article`.\* FROM `photos_article` WHERE (to\_delete = 0) AND (`article_id` = '1')

- - - - - -

SELECT `photos_article`.\* FROM `photos_article` WHERE (to\_delete = 0) AND (`article_id` = '1') AND (`article_id` = '2') <----- This will never work ........

Here is the code in my application:

$articles = new Articles(); // <- extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract $myArticles = $articles->fetchAll($where, $order);

$articlePhotos = new ArticlePhotos(); // <- extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract $selectPhotos= $articlePhotos->select()->where('to\_delete = ?', 0);

foreach ($myArticles as $article) { [...] echo $article->findDependentRowset('ArticlePhotos', null, $selectPhotos)->count(); [...] }

the problem is located on line 813 in file Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract : $select->where("$dependentColumn = ?", $value, $type);

a solution could be ( probably stupid :) ) : $selectTmp = clone $select; $selectTmp->where("$dependentColumn = ?", $value, $type); then it works

Unsetting 'fix version priority' until this issue is reviewed. Setting correct 'affects version'.

OK, I've identified the bug and the cause within Zend\_Db\_Select. I'll investigate a fix shortly - the 'major' fix priority is warranted.

Hello, may I know when this major bug will approximatively be resolved ? Thank you for any info.

I'm inclined not to be treating this as a bug. It's a known behaviour for objects to be passed by reference.

In your example, you could remove the issue simply by re-ordering your query to:-

 
    <pre class="highlight">$articles = new Articles(); // <- extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    $myArticles = $articles->fetchAll($where, $order);
    
    $articlePhotos = new ArticlePhotos(); // <- extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    
    foreach ($myArticles as $article) {
        $selectPhotos= $articlePhotos->select()->where('to_delete = ?', 0);
        [...]
        echo $article->findDependentRowset('ArticlePhotos', null, $selectPhotos)->count();
        [...]
    }

Unless there's a particularly critical reason that this behaviour is undesirable, I'll be marking this as 'won't fix'

It was narural for me to create the WHERE clause before the loop as it was the same for each iteration. If there are specific reasons that it needs to be passed by reference, well then close this bug. Thank you

No action on this issue for too long. I'm reassigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

Will evaluate this within 2 weeks.

When using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select objects, they are typically passed by reference, and in using them, their state is typically changed (this is the nature of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select to fill in the from part when it needs to).

Since this is the case, its best that if you want to reuse such objects, you clone them first. This will preserve their state inside the table consuming them.
