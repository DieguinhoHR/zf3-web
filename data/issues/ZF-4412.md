ZF-4412: Possible (minor) security flaw in Zend\_DB\_\*
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-29T05:21:43.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-01-11T06:02:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql Object contains the database password. Since \_config is protected there should be few cases where it's exposed, but in (for example) a print\_r($object); it will be shown. Depending on wether the password needs to be there or not perhaps one should strip it out.

Someone with more in-depth knowledge of ZF and PHP could probably judge wether this is a problem or not. If not, just close the ticket.

["\_config:protected"]=> array(7) { ["host"]=> string(9) "localhost" ["username"]=> string(4) "root" ["password"]=> string(10) "non-secure" ["dbname"]=> string(4) "dev1" ["charset"]=> string(4) "utf8" ["options"]=> array(2) { ["caseFolding"]=> int(0) ["autoQuoteIdentifiers"]=> bool(true) } ["driver\_options"]=> array(0) { } }

The config variable has to be protected, because the adapter classes share common functionality using this variable, so private is not an option.

Its always a security flaw to print error and debug messages to the user, so its important not to do it :-)
