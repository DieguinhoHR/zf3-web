### Description

The Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_SubForm decorator ContentPane renders a name attribute in the surrounding div with the value of the subform name. This is not XHTML compliant, as there is no name attribute for divs.

Here is an example that produces this behavior:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Dojo_Form();
    $subform = new Zend_Dojo_Form_SubForm();
    $subform->addElement('text', 'test');
    $form->addSubForm($subform, 'test');
    
    echo $form;


This gets the following html output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


````    Â 
    



    

You notice the name attribute on the test-ContentPane div. Just tested with latest trunk (r11304).

Cannot reproduce, and have added test cases to the test suite to verify.

Confirmed.

Downgrading to trivial and changing type to improvement; invalid HTML is not considered a bug, but valid HTML is considered a feature.

Scheduling, tentatively, for next mini release.
