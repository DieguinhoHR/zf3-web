### Description

TestHelper should be require\_once'd in any test suite that may be run independently.

Otherwise, Zend library will not be available in current include\_path and you'll not be able to run a class specific unit test.

Let me show you a few examples:

// the following statement works fine phpunit --verbose Zend\_Service\_Yahoo\_AllTests

// the following statements fail // Failed opening required 'Zend/\*' ... phpunit --verbose Zend\_Service\_Yahoo\_OfflineTest phpunit --verbose Zend\_OpenId\_ConsumerTest

// the following statement fails for the same reason as above phpunit --verbose Zend\_OpenId\_AllTests
