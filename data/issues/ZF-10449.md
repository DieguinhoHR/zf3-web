ZF-10449: Cache documentation: all calls to save() only contain the data, no identifier parameter

### Description

In all examples on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.frontends.html) the call to $cache->save() only contains the data to be cached, without $id parameter. This will not work since $id is a required parameter.

{quote}... since $id is a required parameter.{quote} The id is optional on save anymore, or did I miss something?

It's already implemented:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function save($data, $id = null, $tags = array(), $specificLifetime = false, $priority = 8)
    // ...
        if ($id === null) {
            $id = $this->_lastId;
    // ...
    


Doesn't it working for you ?

Marc: well, according to the API, the ID is optional, but if it's optional, how to do you fetch the saved record back from the cache? You need an ID to load it from the cache, don't you? Or am I missing something here?

If the is no id the last used id will be used else an exception will be thrown. -> This means the used id on load will also be used on save on this example
