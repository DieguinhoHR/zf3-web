The minimum PHP version required for ZF 1.7 is 5.2.4 (see [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.html)). PHP 5.x always contains DateTime, so there's no need for a patch.

Zend Framework 1.7 minimal requirements where upgraded to 5.3.4 which include datetime.
