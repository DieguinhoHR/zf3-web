### Description

Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count shows an error prematurely like this: "Too much files, maximum '1' are allowed but '2' are given"

This can be done in 2 ways

1. Call Zend\_Form\_Element::receive() then call Zend\_Form->getValues()
2. Call Zend\_Form->getValues twice

What happens is the first call adds the temporary file path to Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count /tmp/phpwlAZqc

The second call adds the real file name /tmp/picture.jpg

I do understand that getValues tries to process the form, but should I not be able to call it twice on the same instance? Or sometimes you want to check of the file was received first with Zend\_Form\_Element::receive() then collect the form data with Zend\_Form->getValues(). If it shouldn't something should be done about multiple calls. Took a while to track this down.

Reproducible code below.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    // Ensure library/ is on include_path
    set_include_path(implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, array(
        realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../library'),
        get_include_path(),
    )));
    
    /** Zend_Loader_Autoloader */
    require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
    //automatically registers Zend
    Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->setAction('')
         ->setMethod('post');
    $file = new Zend_Form_Element_File('picture');
    $file->setLabel('Picture');
    //$file->setDestination('/tmp');
    // ensure only 1 file
    $file->addValidator('Count', true, 1);
    $form->addElement($file);
    
    $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('save');
    $submit->setLabel('Save');
    $form->addElement($submit);
    
    if($form->isValid($_POST) && $form->picture->receive()){
        var_dump($form->getValues()); //THIS CAUSES THE COUNT ERROR
    }
    
    echo $form->render(new Zend_View());

There is a logical description for this irritation: Before the file has been uploaded, it is physically not available. Therefor it is counted with the temporary name.

After the upload, it is physically available, and the real name is counted.
