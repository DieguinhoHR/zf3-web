It seems to me that the captcha element is not designed to be validated against the regular validators since its captcha's validator expects the value to be an array with a specific format. IMHO though, there's no need to validate a captcha against anything other than its own validator. An input shorter than the expected length would also be caught by the captcha's validator.
