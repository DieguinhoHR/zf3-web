### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/135>

At the node with many items like Authors and Actors, when they have more than three items, I got a resultset like following.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(0 => array(0 => 'author1', 1 => 'author2'), 1 => 'author3')


it will be,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(0 => 'author1', 1 => 'author2', 2 => 'author3')
    
    76c76,80
    <                     $this->{$v->parentNode->tagName} = array($this->{$v->parentNode->tagName}, (string) $v->data);
    ---
    >                     if (is_array($this->{$v->parentNode->tagName})) {
    >                         array_push($this->{$v->parentNode->tagName}, (string) $v->data);
    >                     } else {
    >                         $this->{$v->parentNode->tagName} = array($this->{$v->parentNode->tagName}, (string) $v->data);
    >                     }

Sorry, I forgot to write the target filename. It is "Zend/Service/Amazon/Item.php".

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
