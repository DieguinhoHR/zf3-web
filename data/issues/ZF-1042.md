### Description

Hi,

Today, we were talking about St. Patrick's Day being on a Saturday this year while we were eating lunch. Someone said it didn't happen that often. Then, after a brief discussion, we all started writing some code to find out when St. Patrick's Day would occur on a Saturday over the next century or so.

Initially, I used mktime() to generate the timestamp that was used by date() to display the day of the week. It worked well until 2038, in which case it began to fail.

Then, I decided to use Zend\_Date. Here's the code I used: for ($x = 1971; $x < 2108; $x++) { $spd = new Zend\_Date(mktime()); $spd->setYear($x); $spd->setMonth(3); $spd->setDay(17); $wd = $spd->toString('EEEE'); echo "{$x}: St. Patrick's Day falls on " . ($wd == "Saturday" ? "**" : '') . $wd . ($wd == "Saturday" ? "**" : '') . "  
"; }

The problem occurs at or after 2038. The next St. Patrick Day that should fall on a Saturday should be in 2040, not 2041. (Several other calendars seem to concur.) All of the calculations on/after 2038 seem to be bad.

I'm guessing this has to do with leap years after 2038, since they all seem to be off by one day, but I don't know.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks,

Travis

Offset of 1 due to extention of the 32bit timestamp between 18. and 19.1.2038.

Fixed with SVN 3877.
