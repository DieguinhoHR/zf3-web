### Description

h4. Introduction: Zend\_Form supports belongsTo (on element level) and elementsBelongTo (on form level) as more explicit and free ways of grouping fields using array notation. The other default way is using SubForms. A key difference between the two approaches is that with SubForms, Zend\_Form _knows_ what data structure to expect when validating and populating. So you can pass it the whole $\_POST array for example, and it will loop and assign values.

With the belongsTo/elementsBelongTo approach however, the data structure inside a Zend\_Form could be 1 level (flat). While in reality, it's going to result in a nested arrays of arrays inside $\_POST once submitted. So the developer can no longer pass $\_POST and expect Zend\_Form to validate against or populate with.

This limitation is noted in the [Advanced Zend\_Form Usage](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.advanced.html#zend.form.advanced.arrayNotation) section in the manual (the last paragraph): bq. Additionally, on the element level, you can specify individual elements may belong to particular arrays using Zend\_Form\_Element::setBelongsTo() method. However, doing this may cause issues when validating your element, and is not recommended in most cases.

This issue aims at improving the situation and hopefully removing this warning from the manual :)

h4. To reproduce: A full example is attached for convenience, however minimal important parts follow: h5. Zend\_Form\_Element's belongsTo:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->addElement('text', 'recipient', array(
        'label' => 'Ship to',
        'required' => true,
        'belongsTo' => 'shipping',
    ));
    
    $form->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
        'label' => 'Submit'.
    ));
    
    if ($request->isPost()) {
        if ($form->isValid($request->getPost())) {
            // Execution never reach here. Form is never valid.
            echo 'Order Placed!';
        }
    }
    
    echo $form->render();


h5. Zend\_Form's elementsBelongTo:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setElementsBelongTo('shipping');
    
    $form->addElement('text', 'recipient', array(
        'label' => 'Ship to',
        'required' => true,
    ));
    
    $form->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
        'label' => 'Submit'.
    ));
    
    if ($request->isPost()) {
        if ($form->isValid($request->getPost())) {
            // Execution never reach here. Form is never valid.
            echo 'Order Placed!';
        }
    }
    
    echo $form->render();

A ready to use example demonstrating the problem when using _belongsTo_ (on the element's level). You just need to correct the path to zf.

Attaching a patch which fixes this issue. It does that by parsing the belongsTo/setElementsBelongsTo and dissolving the value from given data (e.g. POST) based on that.

This was an excellently reported issue -- my thanks to you!

If you could provide unit tests for this functionality, that will make my job even easier. Regardless, I'm scheduling for the next mini release.

Thanks Matthew, it's my pleasure! :)

I started writing the tests few days ago, but more importantly, when I ran the test suite of Zend\_Form with the patch applied, I've noticed that 2 tests failed. So I decided to examine the situation again, and I'm working on an enhanced patch. But I need help :)

Why does FormElements decorator override the subForm's elementsBelongTo? For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->setElementsBelongTo('foo');
    $subForm->setElementsBelongT('bar');
    $subForm->addElement('text', 'name')->name->setLabel('Name');
    $form->addSubForm($subForm, 'sub');


Produces:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


While I'd expect it to produce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">

Attaching an updated patch for Zend\_Form's elementsBelongTo.

This patch (Zend\_Form-Improved\_ElementsBelongTo.patch) includes _unit tests_, and integrates with _isValid, isValidPartial, getMessages, getErrors_ and _getValues_. It also modifies _FormElements_ decorator to produce the markup honoring elementsBelongTo, a unit test was added for that as well.

Patch reviewed and applied to trunk and 1.5/1.6 release branches.

Today i wondered who the smart guy was who wrote this \_dissolveArrayValue() function. And it's really interesting to read your patch because just now these clean methods you wrote are corrupted again somehow. Living Code :) Maybe it's because the \_dissolve function is so dreaded that it's hard to follow.
