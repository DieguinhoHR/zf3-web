### Description

The following data is used inside the application.ini for initializing a new route with a i18n-segment: ;; Impressum: resources.router.routes.impressum.type = "Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route" resources.router.routes.impressum.route = ":language/@route\_Impressum" resources.router.routes.impressum.defaults.module = "default" resources.router.routes.impressum.defaults.controller = "docs" resources.router.routes.impressum.defaults.action = "impressum" resources.router.routes.impressum.defaults.language = "de"

The translation-adapter and -files are prepared and set up correctly.

The Zend\_Navigation-component for example is successfull in creating the url from the given route (de/Impressum or /fr/mentions-legales or /en/impress) - however following that url leads to a not-found-error (404).

But when I am requesting the url with translation-index instead (/de/route\_Impressum or /fr/route\_Impressum or /en/route\_Impressum) the url will match and I get the requested page.

Summary: [1] Defined a new route with a translated segment. [2] Mapping the route to a Zend\_Navigation-Entry [3] Route is urlized correctly in Zend\_Navigation [4] Route doesn't match when followed. - Only the translation-index matches.

May be Zend\_Navigation or Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route issue

Why is it an error of Zend\_Navigation? This makes no sense!
