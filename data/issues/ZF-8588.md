### Description

While following Rob Allen's "Getting Started with Zend Framework for version 1.9.0" tutorial, section "Setting up the Controller", he instructs the user to perform the following tasks:

zf create action add index zf create action edit index zf create action delete index

After inputting the first line, the CLI returns: Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Loader in /path-to-zend/Loader.php on line 31

Scouring the online forums for dozens of hours, I finally stumbled upon this link [http://forums.zend.com/viewtopic.php/â€¦](http://forums.zend.com/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=813&p=16266#p16266). Commenting out the include\_path line in the DEFAULT applications.ini solved the problem.

The folks on IRC @ zftalk said that line should never be included in applications.ini. I suggest that Zend Tool be fixed so that it doesn't do that anymore.

Thanks.

I think, this issue can be closed. The fatal error mentioned in the report is not thrown any more with ZF 1.10.5. The issue should only stay open if this line should not be added to the application.ini when creating a new project through Zend\_Tool:

includePaths.library = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../library"

This was fixed as part of the 1.10.x release series.
