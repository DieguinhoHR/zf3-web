ZF-7400: Mystery error: Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0

### Description

When using the ActiveMQ adapter, this error is presented at the end of the test script:

Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0

I suspect it is because the resource $this->\_socket has already been closed. However, as to why it throws the error is a mystery to me.

The culprit code is at:

trunk/library/Zend/Queue/Stomp/Client/Connection.php function close()

-daniel

The solution to this (to comment-out the "close socket" line in the Stomp/Client/Connection.php file) is causing us some problems, as we're opening and closing a lot of connections in a single process. However, as they're not being closed, the ActiveMQ server is running out of file handles and dying :(

Any chance that a better solution to this can be found, and start actually closing the socket in the "close()" function?

Thanks.

I am aware of this bug, but I don't know what the solution is.

I have also gotten some code together, but not yet tested to reduce the connection count, but I'm putting a lot of work hours.
