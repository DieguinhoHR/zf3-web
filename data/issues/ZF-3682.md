### Description

The columns method documented here

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html#zend.db.select.building.columns-atomic)

Seems to be missing. I implemented it rather crudely with

public function columns($cols,$correlationName) { $this->\_tableCols($correlationName, $cols); }

I implemented it in the following way and found the same issue.

 
                      $select = $this->db->select()
                                      ->from('table_nav')
                                      ->columns(array('title', 'target'))
                                      ->order(array('order ASC'));
                      $stmt = $this->db->query($select);
                      $navItems = $this->db->fetchAll($stmt);


Would have been nice to have this if it's in the documentation. Perhaps it's as easy as putting it in to 1.5.3 ;) One can wish.

I seem to be able to see it here:

[http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Select.php)

Can i close?
