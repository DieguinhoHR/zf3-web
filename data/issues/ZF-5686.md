ZF-5686: Zend\_Db needs mechanism for cross platform SQL functions

### Description

NOW() isn't NOW(). SqLite for example does not recognize this function. If you want to code database independent you have to have some mechanism in Zend\_Db\_Expr namespace that handles the most common functions in a database independent way.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = Zend_Db::factory(..);
    $adapter->getExpression()->now();


Each expression should extend Zend\_Db\_Expr and lay inside a Zend\_Db\_Expr\_Engine\_\* namespace for example. They also need a way to be serialized and deserialized so that they can be used in configuration files, constants or other places that define SQL without knowing about the adapter.
