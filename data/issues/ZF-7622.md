Acknowledged.

I've lowered the priority to Major, since this doesn't block development of the library itself.

I know thats it probably too soon to even tell, but any idea on when this would be implemented?

Otherwise I have strip the gdata api out of my project and create my own.

As much as I hate to say it, probably not anytime soon (unless somebody besides me writes and submits a patch).

There's other issues that are higher priority, and have been open for a while now. Those would come first.

Can you point me to some documentation...maybe I can take a stab at this since I would have to create my own anyway..might as well work on this...

If you want to add a shipping tag I recommend creating the xml manually. For example:

[http://google.com/base/feeds/…](http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/17848225747666177502)2010-03-07T06:00:13.000Z2010-03-29T05:00:00.000ZApple iPod touch 3rd Generation (32 GB) MP3 PlayerSquaretrade ï¿½Â© ap6.0 this item will ship the day of or day after purchase -- usps priority 2-3 day shipping!!!! this ipod is was a store return (not refurbished) and is in excellent condition. it has a full apple warranty that lasts until october, ...eBayUsedElectronics:iPod & MP3 PlayersXMC008ZPA%%%89514716 mc 008 ll a%%%3%%%MC008LL/A%%%MC008LLA%%%XMC008ZPA%%%MC008LL/A%%%MC008%%%MC008LLABUNDLE%%%MC008%%%MC008LLABUNDLE[http://!w0bkrznqcvmw~~\_7.jpg/](/)<http://i.ebayimg.com/08/!!d5pblg!mM>~$(KGrHqYH-EIEqu+sEN2804702616040.0 usd249.99 usdUS0.0falseUS[http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/…](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-84222-2056-0/2?mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2F32GB-Apple-iPod-touch-3rd-Gen-MP3-Player-WIFI-Video_W0QQitemZ280470261604QQcategoryZ73839QQcmdZViewItem)2010-04-25T00:00:00ZApple iPod11729Products

And sending it using $client = Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $service); $gdata = new Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase($client); $gdata->updateEntry($data, $itemUrl);

This way you'll reuse the http request handling included in the Zend Framework.

Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0. The classes remain, but will throw a Zend\_Exception when instantiated.
