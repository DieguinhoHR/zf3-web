ZF-3295: Zend\_Loader::loadFile behavior change
-----------------------------------------------

### Description

According to the documentation Zend\_Loader allways returned boolean (even in ZF 1.0.x). In ZF 1.0.x did however not return boolean in any case. If the loaded file did contain a return the in the file returned value was returned. So this is of course a edge case and it's fixed now, but it did break some backward compatibility.

However deprecated "\_includeFile" still have this problem. I would suggest changing "@return boolean" to "@return mixed" there.

\_includeFile has been removed; closing this issue as no longer relevant.
