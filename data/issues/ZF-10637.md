### Description

I think there could be some API documentation improvements in Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size class: - setMin and setMax both are documented to receive an integer, but looking at the class they can also receive a formatted string ("2MB", "15KB", etc...) with the size. It would be good to have that documented. - setMax seems to have a return type of Zend\_Validate\_StringLength, but it should be Zend\_Validate\_File\_Size. - It would be good to have noted in the API docs that min and max sizes can be both ints or formatted strings. - It would also be good to have documented the supported string formats for sizes.
