It does not... When a translation for zh\_HK is not available THEN it falls back to this translation for zh.

When you don't want this behaviour you have to make your own rerouting within your bootstrap file.

Closing due to not an issue. Full locales are recognised the same as only languages.

Choosing a locale within your browser has no effect to Zend\_Translate when you are doing something wrong. This is no problem is Zend\_Translate, this is a handling problem.

And sorry, but with this little information you gave a help is impossible.

Doing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $translate = new Zend_Translate('array', 'path/to/file.php', 'zh_CN');


will NEVER result in the language zh\_HK... this is impossible as rerouting is actually not available within ZF.
