### Description

When the developer creates a Zend\_Form\_Element of type 'file', it is not possible for him/her to retrieve the path that is inputted by the user. Instead, Zend\_Form\_Element::getValue() returns the destination location.

It would be nice if the developer could get the original file path.

To reproduce:

1) Create a Zend\_Form\_Element of type 'file' i.e $this->createElement ( 'file', 'file' ).

2) Submit the form, and call: $form->file->getValue().

intuitively, you would imagine that this would give you the value that the user inputted, not the destination location.

The "input" path is not supported by HTTP. This data is not available as you will only get the filename and extension when a upload has occured. There is no way how Zend\_Form\_Element\_File could support such a feature.
