ZF-11261: Zend\_Navigation url generation with routes doesn't take default route into consideration

### Description

Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc method getRoute() doesn't take a default route into consideration.

When URLs are constructed using the URL helper, the second parameter must be a route name or null. When using a route and viewing a page all helper constructed URLs must use 'default' as the route parameter. However, the Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc component doesn't take this into consideration. Either all pages in the navigation configuration must define the (in xml form) as default or, the getRoute() method must return the following:

return (is\_null($this->\_route)) ? 'default' : $this->\_route;

This takes a null route and turns it into the default route.

This is not a bug, this is the normal behaviour!

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function assemble($userParams, $name = null, $reset = false, $encode = true)
    {
        if ($name == null) {
            try {
                $name = $this->getCurrentRouteName();
            } catch (Zend_Controller_Router_Exception $e) {
                $name = 'default';
            }
        }
    
        // …
    }

- "null" means: use the current active route
- "default" means: use the actual route instance with the name 'default'

Zend\_Navigation uses the action helper and router as documented. It is not the task of Zend\_Navigation to build a url or to change the behaviour from Zend\_Controller\_Router.
