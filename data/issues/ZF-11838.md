### Description

The note of the [example #9](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html) of View Helpers states that.. bq. The PartialLoop view helper helps solve this issue. It allows you to pass an iterable item (array or object implementing _{color:red}Iterator{color}_) as the model. ... which is correct and incomplete at the same time, as the interface that is really checked against is [Traversable](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/View/Helper/PartialLoop.php); but this cannot be implemented directly, which leaves the programmer with Iterator _or_ IteratorAggregate.
