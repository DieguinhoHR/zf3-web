ZF-8282: zf introduces syntax errors and boogers formatting
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I was a little annoyed because every time I used zf to create an action in an existing controller it would booger up the formatting. Luckily Eclipse has a format command so this was an annoyance not a complete stumbling block.

I was trying to create two CRUD actions in a row in a controller that had just worked five minutes before that. The first create action thought it worked, or seemed to have worked. However the second one failed because the first one had introduced a syntax error into the file. This is also annoying, because it seems to be chewing up the closing bracket on the last function before it inserts the new action function. It's easy to fix, but it seems quite wrong that the tool is inserting bugs into my code.

It is not always destroying the code.

I attach an example which will not appended correctly.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
        public function init() {
            /* Initialize action controller here */
        }
        public function indexAction() {
            // action body
        }
        public function lalaAction() {
            if (true) {
                if (true) {
                    dosomething();
                    dosomething();
                    dosomething();
                    dosomething();
                    dosomething();
                    dosomething();
                    if (anything()) {
                        dosomething();
                        dosomething();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
