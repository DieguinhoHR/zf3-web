### Description

When setting a logger for Zend\_Translate, we can set a Zend\_Log instance, a custom log message but not a custom a priority.

By default, Zend\_Translate\_Adapter, use the notice priority level, but in our application such 'notice' are almost useful only for debug because i18n is not a critical part of it.

Another use case would be if we want to use Zend\_Log\_Filter to selectively log our messages in a separate Zend\_Log\_Writer
