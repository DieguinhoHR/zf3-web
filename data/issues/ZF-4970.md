Please let me know by when can this be fixed. Its required to use multiple checkboxes which is a standard use case.

Actually, we're typically not going to support dojox features from Zend\_Dojo, as their stability cannot be counted on.

There are features for 1.8 that will make it potentially possible for you to consume arbitrary dijits/dojox components, as well as make it easy to create your own view helpers for targettting them.

At this point, I'm closing the issue, as it's not likely we will directly implement the component.

When is ver 1.8 released? I didn't see the dates in the calender for 1.8 If you specify the date, I can schedule things accordingly.

Please note that I said we'll have a helper for consuming _arbitrary_ dijits ready for 1.8, not for the requested dijit. 1.8 will likely be sometime in April, but we do not have a hard date yet.

BTW, we are open to having dojox view helpers/form elements/decorators in ZendX; we simply won't be supporting them directly with the standard library.
