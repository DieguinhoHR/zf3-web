### Description

The new ViewRenderer controller helper is suffering from the same coupling problem some of us had with the Controller initView() method. To utilise a Zend\_View subclass we would need to override the entire ViewRenderer::initView method to replace the explicit class name of "Zend\_View". Simplicity itself, the solution is to abstract the class name into an option with a default of "Zend\_View", say "viewClassName" or similar.

Then I can run off and use "Zps\_View" without subclassing.

Aha, teach me to read more than a few times ;). setView() is public.

setView() method renders this issue invalid. No name coupling exists as the View object can be set from outside the class.
