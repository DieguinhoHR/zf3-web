ZF2-572: Step Validator uses the unprecise fmod function and fails for floats that are internally represented differently

### Description

Giving the step validator a value that cannot be correclty interpreted gives seemingly wrong results in the fmod function.

For example value 15.5, step 0.1 gives a fmod of 0.099999999999999 and not 0.0.
