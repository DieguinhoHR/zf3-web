### Description

I dont have so much experience in PHP programming

unless it (public $queryString) appears to be defined in the class (class PDOStatement on PDO.php), there is no method to load the information, im currently triyng to get the completed query to create a log of db-operations but i got this error.

the code section is this ... on library/Zend/Db/Pdo file Abstract.php

public function insert($table, array $bind) { ... $stmt = $this->query($sql, array\_values($bind)); $result = $stmt->rowCount(); ... $thequery = $stmt->queryString; ... // operation to store the query string in a table. it work if i try to store $sql //but it has the ? in it. }

the error is this...

PHP Notice: Undefined property: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo::$queryString in /opt/lampp/htdocs/geanh/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php

I don't know if it is the right place to put it but i would greatly appreciate any help.

Working on Ubuntu 10.4 XAMPP para Linux 1.7.2

PD. sorry about my english. ;) hope there is enough info.

I was not able to reproduce this error. There is no $queryString variable any Zend/Db/\* file.

Hi there, I'd like to post a solution for this:

$stmt->getDriverStatement()->queryString;
