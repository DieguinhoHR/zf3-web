### Description

If zf.php can't find the Zend library, it prints an error containing this text:

The easiest way to get the zf command running is to allow is to give it the include path via an environment variable ZEND\_TOOL\_INCLUDE\_PATH or ZEND\_TOOL\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_PREPEND with the proper include path to use,

The words "is to allow" are out of place and should be removed.
