### Description

I noticed that the callback function names do not pass to the actual JQuery call correctly.

Example:

I have in my View a code like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $params = array(
                        "resize" => "doMyThingAtResize",
                        "title" => "My Zend Dialog",
                        );
                        
        echo $this->dialogContainer("dialog1", "Some text", $params, array('class' => 'flora'));


It will produce a JQuery call like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $("#dialog1").dialog({"resize":"doMyThingAtResize","title":"My Zend Dialog"});


This does work in other ways, but the callback for _resize_ event does not get called as the value is text and not a function name.

What we would need it to produce would be like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $("#dialog1").dialog({"resize": doMyThingAtResize,"title":"My Zend Dialog"});


Same thing _doMyThingAtResize_ without the quotes.

Problem goes AFAIK goes to _Zend\_Json_ and PHP _json\_encode_ as they will wrap the value with quotes, but I don't think this can be solved there. One solution might be to add a separate function or parameter to add those callback function names. This means some manual code work to merge these into the variables passed to the JQuery call, but I don't see many other options.

seems like the same issue persists into 1.8, and the latest release in svn (r15478 for zendx, and r15563 for zend). i'm still getting the double quotes around the function name. thanks for your help and time.

The correct way to express this would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $params = array(
                        "resize" => new Zend_Json_Expr("doMyThingAtResize"),
                        "title" => "My Zend Dialog",
                        );
                        
        echo $this->dialogContainer("dialog1", "Some text", $params, array('class' => 'flora'));


This stops Zend\_Json from escaping the field.
