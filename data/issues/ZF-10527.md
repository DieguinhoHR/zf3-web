ZF-10527: zf.sh not working on Solaris 10

### Description

zf.sh wasn't working for me on Solaris 10 using v1.10.8.

There are two issues...

First of all sh in Solaris 10 isn't bash, so I changed it to use /bin/bash, this would probably be safer across more OS's. Line 1, change #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash

Second there is no readlink on Solaris, I put a separate file in the directory to emulate readlink for Solaris: --- readlink ---

!/bin/bash
==========

cd -P -- "$(dirname -- "$1")" && if test -L $1; then printf '%s\\n' "$(pwd -P)/$(basename "$1")" fi

Perhaps this could be made into a function within the main zf.sh and not be dependent on readlink.
