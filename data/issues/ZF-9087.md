ZF-9087: Zend\_Json\_Expr violates the JSON standard
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-04T11:56:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-16T05:38:51.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The purpose of Zend\_Json\_Expr is to emit Javascript expressions into a JSON serialized stream, but this purpose conflicts with the JSON standard itself:

<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>

Section "2.1 Values" states:

{quote} A JSON value MUST be an object, array, number, or string, or one of the following three literal names:

 
      false null true


{quote}

There is no space in the standard for Javascript expressions.

I suggest moving this class out of the Zend\_Json package to remove confusion or the appearance of a non-standard implementation.

Really, this feature is generating Javascript, not JSON, so it should be called Zend\_Javascript\_Expr, or something similar.

This feature is entirely optional. Its not enabled by default and its only used in combination with the server side configuration of dojo and jQuery view helpers. Although I agree the naming is not perfect given the context I don't think this is an issue, maybe just for documentation.

Its unfortunate to see standards swept under the rug :(

It would only take a small effort to make this right, but its so much easier to just ignore it.
