### Description

I am using the Zend Framework on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 server with apache 1.3 and php 5.2.3 (cli). I have a script that uses Zend\_Rest\_Client to connect to a service (UPS, specifically) to query data. The rest client object instantiates without problem, when perform the $obj->restPost() I will get a segfault or glibc error about 80% of the time. The other 20% the call will go through fine. The same code with the same Zend framework version works fine on an Ubuntu 7.10 setup with apache 2. I have replicated this crash on 3 separate RHEL4 boxes.

I know there is much troubleshooting to do after this and I am happy to help. However these RHEL boxes are in production and we are not able to do extensive changes to them. Below are some of the errors, I get some combination of these if I run the script several times back to back:

Thanks for the bug report, Dale. I'm closing it however, because this is not the best issue tracker to report segfaults in the PHP executable. Please create a new bug at <http://bugs.php.net/> and copy this very informative description. They should be able to help you get to the bottom of it, and someone should be able to set up ZF to reproduce it. Please send me an email with the bug number after you have created it, as I would like to keep watch on it and see if there's any workaround we can implement in ZF to stay robust and compatible with our current required version of PHP.

Will, after many hours of researching and an eventual upgrade to RHEL5 we came to the final conclusion:

-The HTTP call was failing when invoking the SSL libraries for the https connection out. This turned out to be a problem with the libssl libraries on 64-bit platforms.
