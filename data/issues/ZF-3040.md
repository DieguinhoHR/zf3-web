### Description

The current method of creating feeds is not intuitive, and relies entirely on arrays. A better, more fluent interface would faciilitate feed creation.

The nature of Zend\_Feed is to generate elements based on an array declaration. There is little actual DOM manipulation so a dynamic or fluid API is not feasible without an overhaul of the core functionality. In any case, this functionality will be achieved via Zend\_Feed\_Writer (ZF 1.10 or 1.11 when released).
