### Description

The problem is about displaying of the 2012/12/31

For exemple : $date = new Zend\_Date('2012-12-31', 'Y-MM-dd');

echo $date->toString(); // 31 dÃ©c. 2012 00:00:00 my locale is FR it's good

echo $date->toString('Y-MM-dd'); // 2013-12-31 the result it's false

Probably a dupe of ZF-5297. Use of a lowercase y should solve it.
