### Description

I find 2 Bugs of Document in "36.2. Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client".

As first , I think "catch (Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client\_HttpException $e)" is correct, instead of "Zend\_XmlRpc\_HttpException" in Example 36.5. Handling HTTP Errors.

As Second, in Example 36.6. Handling XML-RPC Faults, "catch (Zend\_XmlRpc\_FaultException $e)" seems wrong. I t will be "catch (Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client\_FaultException $e).
