### Description

I've just seen there's a simillar issue [ZF-4261], but I think I've come up with better solution.

What about allowing to apply the user-defined function, where all logic for rename is contained. Lets take a loook:

<?php

function func\_name($oldName, $ext, $dest, $userData) { //now we can do a lot! loops, expressions, if conditions, etc

$newName = $userData['prefix'] . $oldName . $userData['suffix'] . $ext; while (something){

} return $newName; }

//...

$adapter->addFilter('Rename', array('func\_name', $userData));
