ZF-9623: Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::sendHeaders() can overwrite response code with Location header
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

On the [PHP manual page for header()](http://php.net/header), under the $string parameter description, a special case is listed where the response code defaults to 302 if the header string is a Location header and the HTTP status code has not been set to 201 or 3xx.

With RESTful Web services it is suggested that a Location header may be returned with a 409 Conflict response, which is obviously not picked up by the above.

In this instance, the response code can be overwritten to 302 if a previous header sets the response code. Because of the $httpCodeSent flag in the method, it remains as 302.

A simple fix is to remove the $httpCodeSent flag, never send the response code with any of the header() calls, and always send a HTTP/1.1 header containing the response code at the end. The attached patch achieves this.

The other (probably less desirable) choice is to check for a Location header in each of the if() conditions, and send the response code explicitly with those header() calls.
