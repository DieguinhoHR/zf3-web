### Description

I've a default Currency object defined in my project but for some situations I need to change some formatting settings for a specific rendering of the currency. So I do something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $price = 123.4235123;
    $currency = Zend_Registry::get('currency');
    // Set currency format to SK
    $currencyOptions = array(
        'symbol'        => 'Sk'
        , 'precision'   => 4
    );
    echo $currency->toCurrency($price, $currencyOptions);


But it does not use my $currencyOptions provided here.

I traced the bug back to the following line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $options = $this->_checkOptions($options) + $this->_options;


Following the php manual for this way of merging explains it as {quote} If you want to append array elements from the second array to the first array while not overwriting the elements from the first array and not re-indexing, use the + array union operator {quote}

So this means that the current options of the used Currency can never be changed for a specific situation because it won't override existing keys. This issue can be solved easily by changing the line to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $options = array_merge($this->_options, $this->_checkOptions($options));

I do not see any problem, see the attached file test.

I tried your test.php file and that does result in two exactly the same array outputs.

But via the Currency class in the toCurrency() function, with the following arrays: Current currency options:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [position] => 8 [script] => [format] => [display] => 2 [precision] => 2 [name] => Euro [currency] => EUR [symbol] => € ) 


Options given with th toCurrency() function:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [symbol] => Sk [precision] => 4 )


Using the + way I get the following array back:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [position] => 8 [script] => [format] => [display] => 2 [precision] => 2 [name] => Euro [currency] => EUR [symbol] => € )


(so that's not merged)

Using the array\_merge way I get the following array back:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array ( [position] => 8 [script] => [format] => [display] => 2 [precision] => 4 [name] => Euro [currency] => EUR [symbol] => Sk )


(so that's correctly merged)

Even the PHP Manual says the + way only appends data, so.. :)

Thanks

The manual states:

{quote} The + operator appends elements of remaining keys from the right handed array to the left handed, whereas duplicated keys are NOT overwritten. {quote}

Which means that the default settings are only appended when you did not give them.

Your example is not reproducable. Note that when you for example set a different display at initiation it could be that symbol is not used for this locale. This depends on your settings but is not reproducable with the data you gave.

Using your example and the options you gave I see no problem at all:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $currency = new Zend_Currency();
    
    var_dump($currency->toCurrency(200));
    
    $currencyOptions = array(
        'symbol'        => 'Sk'
        , 'precision'   => 4
    );
    var_dump($currency->toCurrency(200, $currencyOptions));


The returned output is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string '€ 200,00' (length=11)
    string 'Sk 200,0000' (length=12)


This is expected and correct behaviour.

Closing as not reproducable.

Is there a reason to use the + operand instead of the array\_merge function? If there's no real reason, isn't it then possible to just use the array\_merge?

Because I really have the described problem when the + operand is used. I fixed it in my local copy of the Zend library by using the array\_merge function instead of the + operand and now it works perfectly.

It's really strains, I can't reproduce it when using a simple test script but within my whole project it really is an issue. I'll try some more to find a way to reproduce it.

There are 2 reasons:

- array\_merge does not properly handle numeric keys
- - is much better performant than array\_merge
