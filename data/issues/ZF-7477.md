### Description

Working Environment : Apache Server version 2.2.11 , PHP version 5.2.9.

I made an alias on my apache server, with this configuraion:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    Alias /mysite/ "somewhere_in_my_disk/public/" 
    
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride all
        Allow from all


Then I made a controller named loginController in application/controllers. it has an action named index. When I tried to have direct access to it ( using url: <http://localhost/mysite/login/index> or <http://localhost/mysite/login/> ), an internal server error occurred:

Apache error log:

[error] [client 127.0.0.1] Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error. Use 'LimitInternalRecursion' to increase the limit if necessary. Use 'LogLevel debug' to get a backtrace.

Also, I could have indirect access to this action controller like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


`<?php $this->action('index', 'login');?>`


Then I changed the alias into VirtualHost. and everything was OK.

The virtual host configuraion:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    
    ServerName quickstart.localhost
    DocumentRoot somewhere_in_my_disk/public
    
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from all


And this is my .htaccess settings:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
    
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
    RewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]

Not an Issue. This is a misconfiguration of apache which is out of the scope of the Zend Framework, during your endless redirects there will never be a php file called.
