2 is actually a result of PHP's round() failing to produce correct results. This test only fails on certain platforms, when the BCMath extension is not enabled. We are not going to provide a workaround for PHP's round(). The recommended fix is to enable the BCMath extension. I committed a change to prevent the failed test from running when BCMath is not enabled.

1 only occurs for me when I disabled BCMath. Thomas committed a new version of the function involved (toNumber) and is working on it.

Than report that wrong behavior to php.net.

Thank you for your understanding in our hard work.

But as we are not the developers of php itself we are also not able to fix such problems within the extensions. Even if the php developers can fix the problem in future versions of php it still remains in the actual version and therefor we would also have the problem within our framework.

We will see to find a workaround for the framework itself but not for the underlaying BCMath extension or our own BCMath extension class.

So please be pationed.

Btw: This problem is known since 2002 but has not been fixed until now. See <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16532>

I was talking about the round issue.

First off all: You know about [[http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/…](http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)]?
===============================================================================================================================

bcmath doesn't affect round() at all: [[http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/…](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/standard/math.c?view=markup)]. Nevertheless, I tried to reproduce it with PHP 5.2.1 bcmath enabled and bcmath disabled on various platforms:
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

\* Happens on:
==============

\*\* Ubuntu Linux 2.6.15-26-686 (32bit on AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 146 - which is a 64 bit one):\\ 56055.1811\\ Note: Also happens with PHP\_5\_2 CVS, 5.2.0, 5.1.6, 5.1.5, 5.1.4 on the same machine
======================================================================================================================================================================================================

\*\* On Ubuntu Linux 2.6.15-26-server (32bit on AMD Athlon(tm) Processor):\\ 56055.1811\\ Note: Also happens with 5.1.5 on the same machine.
============================================================================================================================================

\*\* On Fedora Linux 2.6.9-1.667 SMP (32 bit on 2x Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU):\\ 56055.1811
=======================================================================================

\*\* On Debian Linux 2.4.25 (32 bit on Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU): \\ 56055.1811
==============================================================================

\* Does not happen on:
======================

\*\* CYGWIN\_NT-5.1 1.5.24(0.156/4/2) (32 bit on Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor):\\ 56055.1812
===============================================================================================

\*\* On WinXP (32 bit on Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor):\\ 56055.1812
=======================================================================

\*\* On Win2k (32 bit on Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor):\\ 56055.1812
=======================================================================

What may lead you into the (in my eyes wrong assumption) that bcmath is the key is that windows builds have bcmath enabled by default, which Linux builds don't have.

If you have other platforms than Win32, where round(56055.18115, 4) is working mathematically correct, please provide details. Nevertheless, this is NOT a bug in PHP, the correct solution is testing this with a value that passes on all (or at least the most common) platforms.

If you still think, this is a bug in PHP, please prove that.

I say it once more again:

Please be patient, we will find a fix for the framework. Some issues can not be fixed within one day as we are working in our sparetime for the framework.

I don't want to hustle you. I just want to make clear, that Gavin's statement {quote}#2 is actually a result of PHP's round() failing to produce correct results. This test only fails on certain platforms, when the BCMath extension is not enabled. We are not going to provide a workaround for PHP's round(). The recommended fix is to enable the BCMath extension. I committed a change to prevent the failed test from running when BCMath is not enabled.{quote} is wrong in my eyes and that hiding the behaviour by disabling the tests when bcmath is not enabled is wrong as well.

And of course I'd like to know anything that proves me wrong so that someone (Gavin, me, whoever else) can file a php.net bug in that case.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-18T13:05:22.000+0000

The first should now be fixed with SVN 4104. Could you please test it on your side ?

 

 

Posted by Sebastian Nohn (nohn) on 2007-03-18T13:24:55.000+0000

Both work now.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-18T13:25:36.000+0000

I'm with gavin because the code is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public static function round($op1, $precision = 0)
        {
            if (self::$_bcmathDisabled) {
                return (string) round($op1, $precision);
            }
        .....


So... if BCMath is disabled it uses the standard php round function. And this produces a failure within linux environments because the lowest digit is truncated instead of rounded.

Can you test something like this with disabled BCMath extension in Linux and Windows and give me the result ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once('Zend/Locale/Format.php');
    print "\n".round(56055.18115, 4);
    print "\n".Zend_Locale_Math::round('56055.18115', 4);


Should output "56055.1812". If seems that you have much more access to different OS types than myself ;-)

Nice... ;-)

I didn't change anything with the second one... but I think it's becasue gavin changed the test behaviour. With my short code you should be able to see if the problem is remaining or already gone ;-)

Anyhow... I will close this issue as the original problem has been found.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-18T13:33:29.000+0000

Fixed with SVN 4104

 

 

Posted by Bill Karwin (bkarwin) on 2007-03-19T11:39:45.000+0000

Changing fix version to 0.9.1.

 

 

Posted by Sebastian Nohn (nohn) on 2007-03-24T08:56:39.000+0000

On Linux it's

56055.1811 56055.1811

Testing without bcmath on windows is not that easy as bcmath is compiled into win32 builds and not a configurable extension.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-24T11:23:21.000+0000

It's already marked as fixed.

Anyway, it seems that windows and linux don't behave the same way even with the standard round function from php...

And as this is a problem from php itself we can not solve this... Because mathematically "round(56055.18115, 4);" should output 56055.1812 and not .1811... and this is a php internal problem which the ZF can not solve.

But gavin pointed this already.

 

 

Posted by Sebastian Nohn (nohn) on 2007-03-24T13:07:18.000+0000

Again: This is _not_ a bug in PHP: [http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/…](http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-24T14:00:37.000+0000

It seems that we both have a different view of this...

But my opinion is that when I call php's round function and it produces different results related on which OS it is running it's not a problem which I should solve.

And I did not say that it's a bug...

I only said that I will not solve related problems...

round(56055.18115, 4) on Linux = 56055.1811 round(56055.18115, 4) on Windows = 56055.1812 For me this is no bug but only a behaviour of php itself.

And even it you point a third time to this article... I am no native english, I have also no degree (until now), and I have no time to go through this as there are really much more other things to do before 1.0 which I am doing in my sparetime.

 

 

Posted by Sebastian Nohn (nohn) on 2007-03-24T14:56:24.000+0000

Oh well then... It's not an "PHP Internal Problem" but a problem any computer in this world has. Floating Point Numers are never exact. Even the rather short numbers like "ab,cd" become "ab,ce999999999..."

Second (and more important problem): round() operates on float numbers. 56055.18115 can't be represented as float. It's a double, and this is where the problem in the implemtation was. Please read <http://php.net/float> (should be available in your mother tongue).

I agree with Thomas here. PHP obviously fails to produce the correct results for round() in many circumstances. Although we are aware of the true reasons for the failure, it is out of scope for the ZF to directly try to solve this problem, since the ZF already provides a solution: enable BCMath extension. I also committed a BCMath compatible round function in Zend/Locale/Math.php that supports unlimited precision without the problems shown in comments above.
