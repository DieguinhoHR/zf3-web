### Description

it will be really nice to have this property available to set in decorators in form

something like it is in element decorators, where i can have array('Label', array('tag' => 'th', 'escape' => false)),

and it will be look somehow like here array('formErrors', array('placement' => 'PREPEND','escape' => false))

now its in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_FormErrors on line 422 set hardcoded, thanks
