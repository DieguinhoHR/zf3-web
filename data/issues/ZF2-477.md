### Description

When in layout we add several navigation rendering get fatal error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->navigation('navigation');
    $helper = $this->navigation()->findHelper('menu');
    $helper->setContainer('secondnavigation'); // <- Fatal error: Call to a member function get() on a non-object in /usr/share/zf2/library/Zend/View/Helper/Navigation/AbstractHelper.php on line 222
    
    echo $this->navigation('secondnavigation'); // <- render old 'navigation'.


for testing enough one navigation as this line also do error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $helper->setContainer('navigation');
