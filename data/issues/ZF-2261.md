### Description

As there is nothing obvious reason to name a service client for Google services different to the others it should be called Zend\_Service\_Gdata.

Hi Lars,

Thanks for the suggestion and interest. In hindsight, you're probably correct, but the benefits of maintaining backwards compatibility outweigh the benefits of switching the name IMO.

This question was also answered by someone at Zend earlier this year: [http://nabble.com/Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar-or-Zend\_Servâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Gdata_Calendar-or-Zend_Service_Google_Calendar--tf3891205s16154.html#a11051478)

Cheers, -Ryan

I see that. But I have the feeling that this move could be done with the 1.2 as users expect things to be changed there. I really think that consistency is everything and you will have absolutely no chance to explain somebody why it is named the way it is named in the future. Therefore the interested developer will have the feeling that Zend Framework is just a bunch of classes, not a well though out component repository where the single components not follow the same guidelines and speak with a completely different tongue.

By the way: I really like the proposed name Zend\_Service\_Google as a user would easily see "Ah, this is for consuming Google services". Gdata is more an insider, so I think Zend\_Service\_Google is a pretty good name.

I'm assigning Wil from Zend to this issue for a final decision.

Lars -- I understand all your arguments (and thank you for making them), but I believe that the costs of implementing a breaking change at this point outweigh the benefits achieved by moving this code to a new 'package.' I have been told that no breaking changes are allowed in the library now that the 1.0 milestone has been reached.

Also, we couldn't rename it to Zend\_Service\_Google, as this component isn't intended to work with all Google services -- only those that adhere to the GData protocol. So, it would have to be Zend\_Service\_Gdata or Zend\_Service\_Google\_Gdata. Both of these names are incredibly long and would make it very difficult to construct new instances of the classes in this component. For instance, imagine constructing a new class to represent an atom title. It would be $title = new Zend\_Service\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Title('text') or $title = new Zend\_Service\_Google\_Gdata\_App\_Extension\_Title("text"); Granted, we have a magic factory method to make this shorter (Zend\_Gdata::\_\_call), but there are cases that some people wouldn't want to use it.

Hi Lars, thanks much for the feedback! Currently I feel that the GData component is located in the best place for the next release for a few reasons. 1) Backwards compatibility- we'll be breaking it in future releases, but only with sufficient justification. BC is more important for minor releases- this might be something we could entertain for a major release, but not the next release. 2) We have a special partnership with Google to develop these components, one of the terms of which is that we distribute a standalone GData release. This is well modeled as a 'top level' component for these purposes. 3) GData services are different from most of the other web services we have clients for because they are feed-based. This isn't really a particularly important difference from a developer- or user-standpoint, but they are likely to have very different dependencies and may not reuse much of what we put in the Zend\_Services package (not that there's much there now, but for the future).

Hope you understand, and keep that feedback coming.

@Ryan: Thanks for the remark related to Google vs. Gdata. So I would think that Zend\_Service\_Gdata would be good.

@Wil: The API break policy is pretty sensible, but what about renaming it in 1.2.0 or something like that? If I understood you correctly, breaking the API in 1.2.0 would be ok, wouldn't it? The special Google contract could be resolved by adjusting the class names when rolling out a Zend\_Gdata release. With a little bit of sed-magic this should not be hard (I would be willing to contribute the required build script, if you want).
