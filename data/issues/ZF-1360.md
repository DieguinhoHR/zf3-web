ZF-1360: MS SQL Server: multiple bugs in describeTable() method
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-05-07T16:55:51.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.0 RC1 (28/May/07)

### Description

This method is actually unusable.

line 144 : Notice: Undefined index: coumn\_name -> misspelled array key

line 170 : array value of 'PRIMARY' key is buggy. -> after first set, $is\_primary keeps its value during iteration (Must be reset for each iteration).

bugs already reported in ZF-1092 line 152 : Notice: Undefined offset: 1 -> explode() doesn't always return a 2-dim array, so $rest can't be always set ($rest is useless here).

line 154 : Warning: array\_key\_exists() The second argument should be either an array or an object -> wrong parameters order

The patch submitted correct all these bugs + bug ZF-1271 (switch to numeric indices) + little improvement : define values for 'COLUMN\_POSITION' and 'PRIMARY\_POSITION' keys

tested on MSSQL Server 2000

(Columns order seems to be the same for MSSQL Server 2005, according to [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/…](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189813.aspx) and [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/…](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176077.aspx) )

Thanks very much Marc for the patch!

I have committed changes in revision 4757 including this patch, or very similar code.

Unfortunately, I still do not have a MS SQL Server instance against which to test. I'll leave this issue open until I can run the unit tests and verify the fix.

Bill,

I have updated my working copy to revision 4757, thanks.

But you have forgotten a bug line 153 :

 
    <pre class="highlight">/** Wrong code */
    $isPrimary = array_key_exists($primaryKeyColumn, $row[$column_name]);

-> the arguments should be switched (array\_key\_exists ( mixed key, array search )).

```

Ok thank you I have applied that fix in revision 4764. I'm sorry I can test only with "php -l" at this time. :-( But I hope to improve that this week.

Back to work, I have tested the revision 4764 on our sql server instance and discover a new bug that was not in my patch.

You have forgotten a line in my patch (probably not included after your correction on $primaryPosition) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    This var is used in the metadata array $desc :


 
            $desc[$row[$column_name]] = array(
                'SCHEMA_NAME'      => null, // @todo
                'TABLE_NAME'       => $row[$table_name],
                'COLUMN_NAME'      => $row[$column_name],
                'COLUMN_POSITION'  => (int) $row[$column_position],


... ```

That was a little improvement in my patch (the previous 'COLUMN\_POSITION' value was set to null (@todo).) Or maybe this improvement is not a good implementation too ?

(Sorry for the inconvenience, I did only a visual check yesterday.)
