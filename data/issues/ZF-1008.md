### Description

The following code produces Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Service\_Exception' with message 'The following parameters are invalid: Artist'

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Service/Amazon.php';
    $amazon = new Zend_Service_Amazon('AMAZON_API_KEY');
    $response = $amazon->itemSearch(array('SearchIndex' => 'Music', 'Artist' => 'Amy Winehouse'));
    
    ?>

According to the Amazon docs ([http://amazon.com/gp/aws/â€¦](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/sdk/main.html/103-9285448-4703844?s=AWSEcommerceService&v=2005-10-05&p=ApiReference/ItemSearchOperation)) Artist is a valid parameter.

So please add it to the list of valid parameters. I added it in my copy (version 0.8.0) at line 949 of Zend/Service/Amazon.php

Thanks!
