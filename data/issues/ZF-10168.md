ZF-10168: Zend\_Mime\_Decode is not able to split a mime message when end boundary is missing.

### Description

Method splitMime throws an exception (throw new Zend\_Exception('Not a valid Mime Message: End Missing')) when no end boundary is found. This causes a problem for me. I received an e-mail where the end boundary is missing, and get the exception mentioned above. I was able to continue parsing the email by replacing the exception line with:

$p = strlen($boundary);

All the remaining data is handled as the last part.

i did fix it with

// no more parts, find end boundary $p = strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . '--', $start); /\* fixed \*/ if ($p===false) $p = strlen($boundary); if ($p===false) { throw new Zend\_Exception('Not a valid Mime Message: End Missing'); }

Isn't an end boundary required by the MIME spec? I don't think Zend\_Mime\_Decode should be working around others' broken implementations

The problem is that the MIME is retrieved 1on1 from a POP3 server. So I have to deal with it as it is delivered. So the fix is very needed.

It is a slippery slope when you start working around bugs in third party applications - better to suggest a fix at the source. What application generated the malformed message? It is likely listed in the headers.

AFAIK, POP3 shouldn't have anything to do with the MIME content. That content is generated by the original creator of the message so it would be a bug in whatever application is generating the malformed message.

A Try/Catch block to allow you to gracefully recover from malformed messages would probably be more appropriate (outside of this component).

Closing as not an issue. As mentioned, suggest you work around this with Try/Catch block or similar. It is expected behavior to throw an exception on a malformed message.

If anyone gets this error and is pulling emails from Google IMAP you might be interested in: [http://google.com/support/forum/…](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=33ae5a9e490f33e6&hl=en)

Not all messages ending by '--' . $boundary . '--' To fix this bug we shold write code like this:

 
        // no more parts, find end boundary
        $p = strpos($body, '--' . $boundary . '--', $start);
        /* fixed */ if ($p===false) $p = strlen($body);
        if ($p===false) {
            throw new Zend_Exception('Not a valid Mime Message: End Missing');
        }


Zend Framework Developers please fix this bug, do not forget it in the next release! Yours sincerely :)

I think the fact that this has been closed as "Not an Issue" is unacceptable. These messages load fine in Thunderbird, Gmail, and other clients and blow up in Zend Framework.

How can I get involved so I can have this issue assigned to me and correct it? Would rather not have to manually apply a patch every time I download Zend Framework.

You will need to sign a CLA (See here: [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)). Once it's processed and you have been added to the zf-framework-dev group you will be able to attach patches to issues here in JIRA.

This is what I do: attach your patch, then email the component maintainer and/or the dev mailing list asking to have it reviewed. Keep doing that every couple of weeks until someone from Zend or the CR team takes the time to review your patch. I haven't seen it written officially, but my feeling is that Zend Framework 1.x is more or less frozen...Zend staff and most core contributors are focused on building v2.0, so there hasn't been much activity around v1.x as of late.
