### Description

Zend\_CurrencyTest::testPHPsScientificBug fails with float like '1.0E-5'. In Zend\_Locale\_Format::toNumber, normalize is made before floatalize thus: '1.0E-5' become '-1.0E5' before floatalization.

Reproduce: 'phpunit --filter testPHPsScientificBug Zend/CurrencyTest.php' give

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_CurrencyTest::testPHPsScientificBug
    Failed asserting that two strings are equal.

After inversion of line 303 and 304 in Zend\_Locale\_Format (r24321): it's ok and all others tests pass

Thomas: I applied the patch on trunk with r24323. Can you review it? All tests pass (complete suite not only Zend\_Locale or Zend\_Currency)
