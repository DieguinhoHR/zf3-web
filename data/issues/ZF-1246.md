### Description

Per [[http://benramsey.com/archives/â€¦](http://benramsey.com/archives/ny-thoughts-and-zend_view_helper-notes/)], the following changes need to be made to the Zend\_View\_Helper documentation:

- Indicate that all helper classes need a class prefix, and that by default it should be Zend\_View\_Helper\_
- Better indicate the relation between the helper class and the corresponding helper method -- i.e. that the first is TitleCapped, and the second named the same but camelCased: e.g., the Zend\_View\_Helper\_TranslateText::translateText().
