### Description

Need a possibility to set character encoding for Mysqli / Pdo\_Mysql adapter (in adapter's constructor) ( sub-classing adapter makes impossible to use Zend\_Db::factory() method )

and then query like (for utf8): 'SET NAMES utf8' on every connect()

- - - - - -

h3. Possible Solutions as recorded from comments below

When the 'charset' option is available to the Zend\_Db::Factory(), do the following in the adapters \_connect method: ||Adapter||Proposed Solution|| |Mysqli|use mysqli\_set\_charset| |Oracle|use the charset option for oci\_connect| |Db2|no solution| |Pdo\_Ibm\_Db2|no solution| |Pdo\_Ibm\_Ids|no solution| |Pdo\_Mssql|no solution,depends on server configuration| |Pdo\_Mysql|use PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_INIT\_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES "utf8''| |Pdo\_Oci|include charset in DSN| |Pdo\_Pgsql|use SET NAMES| |Pdo\_Sqlite|not needed|

This is also relevant for OCI adapter and others, but the implementation varies.

mikespook writes:

I used utf8 for my charset with Oracle.

But, there are no item can set the charset in the param of the Zend\_Db::factory(). And you konw, MS Windows use GB18030 for the charset in China. So when I send a SQL to the Oracle with charset utf8, I got a error.

I make this patch for we can set charset to the Oracle.

In the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle we have

 
    <pre class="literal">
            if (isset($this->_config['dbname'])) {
                $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    $this->_config['dbname']);
            } else {
                $this->_connection = oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password']);
            }


shouldn't it be something like

 
    <pre class="literal">
            $charset = (isset($this->_config['charset']))
                ? $this->_config['charset']
                : null;
    
            $dbname = (isset($this->_config['dbname']))
                ? $this->_config['dbname']
                : null;
    
            $this->_connection = oci_connect(
                $this->_config['username'],
                $this->_config['password'],

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Since the PDO database adapters use base (abstract) method for creating a db connection I've added a check ('mysql' == $this->\_pdoType) so the 'set names' query is issued only for PDO\_Mysql adapter (I don't know how other databases handle this issue).

I really hope this issue will be fixed in the next minor release, it has been long overdue.

If there is something else I can do to help, please let me know.

Please disregard the patch for Pdo\_Mysql, haven't really worked with Pdo till now. "SET NAMES" do work for Pdo\_Mysql adapter!!! You just have to pass it as a driver option...

The correct way to use it is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php
    
    $db = new Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql(array(
        'host'     => 'your_host_or_ip',
        'username' => 'your_myslq_username0,
        'password' => 'mysql_pass',
        'dbname'   => 'your_db_name',
        'driver_options'  => array(PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES \'utf8\'')
    ));


 

 

Posted by James Dempster (letssurf) on 2008-05-26T00:47:48.000+0000

On Pdo\_Mysql I've always just used $db->query('SET NAMES UTF8'); without any problems. I tested it to make sure it works correctly.

 

 

Posted by Goran Juric (gog) on 2008-05-26T03:05:04.000+0000

Ofcourse it does. But if you send a query you are forcing you app to connect to the database. There are times that you don't want to connect to the database if it isn't really needed, that's what lazy loading is for.

This way, you can use Pdo\_Mysql, utf8, and still have lazy loading of the db.

But this issue is still unresolved because in Mysqli you do have to send "SET NAMES 'utf8'" after connecting to the database.

 

 

Posted by Pádraic Brady (padraic) on 2008-05-26T13:36:21.000+0000

I would love to see this implemented. At the moment managing lazy loading is either something you get creative about, or with a light application simply ignore. Getting it internalised would make life that bit easier.

 

 

Posted by Helgi Hrafn Halldórsson (harabanar) on 2008-06-03T02:11:37.000+0000

any way .. could this at least be fixed in the Oracle Adapter since oci\_connect supports charset ? :D

All right, this item officially has twice as many votes as the next popular item. If we don't implement it for 1.6 we risk user revolt. :0 Simon, is this something that you'll be able to do. If not, I'll troll for help from the rest of the community.

For mysqli the correct way is to use mysqli::set\_charset ( see [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.set-charset.php) ).

Here's the patch for it:

Here's the resulting patch. It implements charset support for Mysql, Oracle, Pdo\_Mysql, Pdo\_Oracle and Pdo\_Pgsql, as well as unit tests for these.

That's great to provide those patches, but I think the interface to supply character set to each respective brand of database is only half the problem.

The other part of the problem is that a given character set may be known by a different name in each database. For example, MySQL uses 'utf8' where Oracle uses 'AL32UTF8'. Oracle even has a charset called 'utf8' but it's different. See [http://decipherinfosys.wordpress.com/2007/01/…](http://decipherinfosys.wordpress.com/2007/01/28/difference-between-utf8-and-al32utf8-character-sets-in-oracle/)

This makes it hard to create a set of config parameters that can be used orthogonally for several brands of database. You'd have to know the different names in each database for any given charset you want to use.

How would I recommend solving this? The Zend\_Db\_Adapter interface currently supports a config parameter 'driver\_options', which is an associative array used for options that are specific to each brand of database. I would suggest that Zend\_Db\_Adapter use 'driver\_options'->'charset' for the name of the charset as it is known by the brand of database.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('oracle', array('driver_options'=>array('charset'=>'AL32UTF8')));


Then you can implement a charset abstraction layer. Decide on a set of core charsets that will be supported by Zend\_Db, and define these as const strings.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Db
    {
      const CHARSET_UTF8 = utf8;
      . . .
    }


Then in each Zend\_Db\_Adapter class, create a protected associative array mapping the abstract charset names to native charset names. If the database doesn't support one, or if you simply don't know what it it's called, leave it out of the mapping array.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
    {
      protected $_charsetMap = array(
        Zend_Db::CHARSET_UTF8 => 'AL32UTF8'
      );
      . . .
    }


Then if I pass a config parameter 'charset' => 'utf8' to my Db Adapter factory, it'll perform the mapping and add the entry to the driver\_options, where it will get applied using code similar to your patch.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('mysqli', array('charset'=>Zend_Db::CHARSET_UTF8));


Developers can still use uncommon charsets that are not in the set of core abstract charsets supported by Zend\_Db's mapping table. They just need to specify it in the 'driver\_options' array by its native name, instead of in the 'charset' parameter.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('oracle', array('driver_options'=>array('charset'=>'BN8BSCII'))); // Bangladesh BSCII charset


You don't necessarily have to fill out the full set of core charsets in every adapter class. But you do need to throw an exception if I pass an abstract charset name that isn't supported in the adapter I chose.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('pdo_sqlite', array('charset' => Zend_Db::CHARSET_LATIN1));
    // may throw exception

Since this has been sitting open for so long, I went ahead and took a stab at making a patch. So here it is, against current SVN r11422. Adds charset support to Mysqli, PDO\_Mysql, and PDO\_Pgsql adapters. A new optional parameter 'charset' is passed to the adapter.

Whoops. And then there was JIRA not showing me the comment discussion. I feel extremely embarrassed and am going to crawl into a hole now. :)

Hi,

do not forget Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle : need charset support too !!!

it's ok in PDO\_OCI, but PDO\_OCI is still unstable and chrashes very often (try use clob :( u'll see ).

current 1.7.0 code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _connect()
    {
    ...
            if (isset($this->_config['dbname'])) {
                $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    $this->_config['dbname']);
            } else {
                $this->_connection = oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password']);
            }
    ...


could be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _connect()
    {
    ...
                $this->_connection = @oci_connect(
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    isset($this->_config['dbname'])?$this->_config['dbname']:null,
                    isset($this->_config['charset'])?$this->_config['charset']:null,
                   );
    ...


best regards

A quick solution for charset with Pdo\_Mysql:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php';
    
    class Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql_Charset extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql
    {
        protected function _connect(){
            if ($this->_connection) {
                return;
            }
            parent::_connect();
            if(array_key_exists('charset',$this->_config) && $this->_config['charset']){
                global $logger;
                $logger->debug('Setting db charset to '.$this->_config['charset']);
                $this->_connection->exec('SET NAMES '.$this->_config['charset']);
            }
        }
    }
    


Then use something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory(Pdo_Mysql_Charset', array(
            'host'     => '.....', 
            'username' => '....' ,
            'password' => '....',
            'dbname'   => '....',
            'charset'  => 'utf8',
        ));

After cleanup:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php';
    
    class Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql_Charset extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql
    {
        protected function _connect(){
            if ($this->_connection) {
                return;
            }
            parent::_connect();
            if(array_key_exists('charset',$this->_config) && !empty($this->_config['charset'])){
                $this->_connection->exec('SET NAMES '.$this->_config['charset']);
            }
        }
    }

Usage of SET NAMES for setting the charset of the connection, the result and the client for MySQL is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Opens the door for SQL Injections. SET NAMES exists only for the sake of the mysql command line client where there is no way to set the connection's character set when you connect, thus SET NAMES is used. mysql's API, libmysql, has means of setting the character set, for good reasons. Using SET NAMES can lead to security problems with specific character sets...Think - SQL Injection. Either use: [http://bg.php.net/manual/en/…](http://bg.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-set-charset.php) or mysqli\_options() on a handle returned from mysqli\_init() and this should be done before mysql\_real\_connect()

$mysql = mysqli\_init(); mysqli\_options($mysql, 7, "utf8"); //sorry for the magic number but ext/mysqli doesn't register the value of MYSQL\_SET\_CHARSET\_NAME // coming from mysql.h as constant. In mysql.h it is 7 and won't change for the time being. mysqli\_real\_connect($mysql, ...);

I needed to have UTF-8 encoding on MySQLi driver, here's a quick patch that I'm using to solve this problem. I would hope every implementation would support this option.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    class Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
    {
    
        ...
    
        protected function _connect()
        {
    
            ...
    
            // line 342 using Zend 1.7.5
            if (isset($this->_config['charset'])) {
                mysqli_set_charset($this->_connection, $this->_config['charset']);
            }
        }
    
        ...
    
    }


Sorry if I'm repeating code.

bleah... can`t edit my comment. I mean will lack of solution for Db2 adapters prevent this issue from fixing for other adapters? (please remove the above comment)

 

 

Posted by Jurrien Stutterheim (norm2782) on 2009-04-05T15:36:21.000+0000

Bill: I like the idea of supporting charsets by using the constants. However, I feel like that's a different issue than this one. The focus of this issue should be on supporting setting the charset in the first place. Adding a layer of abstraction on top of that is pretty much a standalone task, even though its implementation would probably rework a part of the code that's being updated for the charset support. Seeing as a lot of people need this feature it might not be worth waiting for a full implementation of the charset abstraction proposal.

Seeing as I need support for this in the Oci8 adapter, I'm going to write a patch for that today. If there's no solution for Db2 (Db2 experts, please comment!) I would like to suggest implementing the suggestions from the table to get this issue resolved.

 

 

Posted by Sorin Alin Stoiana (sorin) on 2009-04-05T16:29:24.000+0000

@Jurrien FYI, the patch I submitted here [#action\_23500 ] also provides support for Oci8

 

 

Posted by Jurrien Stutterheim (norm2782) on 2009-04-05T18:56:47.000+0000

This issue has been resolved for the Pdo\_Mysql, Pdo\_Pgsql, Mysqli and Oracle drivers in revision 14691 and 14692. At the moment I can only verify that this works on Oracle. Before closing this issue I would like to confirm there are no issues with the patch. Would everybody be so kind to verify that the patch works for Pdo\_Mysql, Pdo\_Pgsql and Mysqli? You can specify the charset in the adapter config using the 'charset' key.

 

 

Posted by Sorin Alin Stoiana (sorin) on 2009-04-06T01:34:21.000+0000

A more complete patch is [here|#action23500] . It implements charset support for Mysql, Oracle, Pdo\_Mysql, Pdo\_Oracle and Pdo\_Pgsql, as well as unit tests for these. It has been tested with Oracle XE, Oracle Real Application Cluster, Mysql, and Pgsql.

Why was this patch disregarded? From what I read in the Contributor's Guide, all changes must come with unit tests.

While I approve the kind of swift action Jurrien took in solving the issue at hand, I believe we shouldn't compromise when it comes to providing fixes.

 

 

Posted by Jurrien Stutterheim (norm2782) on 2009-04-16T17:17:39.000+0000

A test was available already, but was marked as skipped. It's enabled in revision 14952 and successfully passes on Mysqli, Pdo\_Mysql, Pdo\_Oci and Oracle. Still looking for someone to test on Pdo\_Pgsql.

 

 

Posted by Jurrien Stutterheim (norm2782) on 2009-04-16T17:58:52.000+0000

I've installed Postgres for myself and identified and fixed one last issue there. As of revision 14953 I can successfully run the test on Mysql, Pdo\_Mysql, Oci8 and Pdo\_Pgsql. Pdo\_Oci already supported the charset option. Closing issue as "fixed". :)

I'm working with Zend Framework Version 1.9.6 here and _cannot_ confirm that this issue has been resolved (using pdo\_mysql rev 16942). My html output is set to utf-8, the database runs on utf-8 as well (utf8\_general\_ci) but all special chars are messed up.

Yanick Rochon's hotfix worked for me though. ([http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1541?focusedCommentId=29251&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_29251))
