### Description

Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_Db::write() is using the insert()-method of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract in a wrong way so you have to create a workaround to use it for your own Zend\_Db\_Adapter. I think I´ve created a good patch which will solve this problem:

i´ve added the two files because my server crashed and i can´t find the error so the files aren´t reachable. now they are permanently reachable.

I can vouch for Jan's patch. It works, unlike the current code in the Framework. Here is a diff:

Fixed in revision 3450.

But we are shortly going to introduce a new object-oriented design for Zend\_Log that replaces the current implementation, so this bug fix will be short-lived. :-)
