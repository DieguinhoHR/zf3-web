ZF-5773: Improvement to 53.4.1.2. Partial Helper documentation

### Description

Suggestion for code sample to illustrate partialLoop usage with object model; although the docs appear comprehensive now my own code is working, they really didn't when I was having trouble with it!

So, to list all bugs with status new, together with who they were reported by, you could use code like:

In the controller: $bugsTable = new Bugs(); $bugsRowset = $bugsTable->fetchAll(array('bug\_status = ?' => 'NEW')); $this->view->bugsRowset=$bugsRowset; $this->view->partialLoop()->setObjectKey('bugsRow');

And in the view script:

- <?= $this->partialLoop('partial.phtml',$this->bugsRowset); ?>

And partial.phtml

 <?=$this->bugsRow->description; ?> reported by <?=$this->bugsRow->findParentRow('Accounts')->account\_name; ?>
