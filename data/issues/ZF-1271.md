### Description

In Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Mssql.php

Column names (i.e all $row keys) are lowercase in the describeTable() method.

for example :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            foreach ($primaryKeysResult as $row) {
                $primaryKeyColumn[$row['column_name']] = true;
            }


The column names must use the PDO CASE\_xxxxx attribute.

The solution for ZF-1268 will be implemented in all PDO adapters.

Changes committed in revision 4757 may resolve this issue. But I will leave it open for now until I can verify the changes against unit tests.
