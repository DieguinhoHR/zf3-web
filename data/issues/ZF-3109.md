ZF-3109: Zend/Locale/Data.php (Line 974) should check that the array index exists
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Line 974 in Zend/Locale/Data.php should check that the array index exists before comparing to avoid causing "Undefined index" notices. I only noticed this because I used Zend Locale as a standalone module, and use my own error handler (which shows notices).

Example fix: Change from "if ($val[$key] != $value) {" to "if (isset($val[$key]) && $val[$key] != $value) {".

Sorry for the duplicate (ZF-3110), but there is a bug in the bugreporter... After submitting (or editing) the bug, a 404 error is encountered: "HTTP Status 404 - No view for result [error] exists for action [ViewIssue]"
