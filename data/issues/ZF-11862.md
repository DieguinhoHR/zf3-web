The above code is correct, as an instance of Application\_Model\_Guestbook is provided to the find method. As objects are passed by reference, you can use the result of the find method in your code like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $objGuestbook = new Application_Model_Guestbook();
    $mapGuestbook = new Application_Model_GuestbookMapper();
    
    $mapGuestbook->find(1, $objGuestbook);
    // $objGuestbook is now populated with data from the first record


The manual page should be updated to show an example of how to load a specific record.

why not it return as usual?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function find($id, Application_Model_Guestbook $guestbook)
        {
            $result = $this->getDbTable()->find($id);
            if (0 == count($result)) {
                return;
            }
            $row = $result->current();
            $guestbook->setId($row->id)
                      ->setEmail($row->email)
                      ->setComment($row->comment)
                      ->setCreated($row->created);
            return $guestbook;
        }

Maybe the code will be more readable to other programmer.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $objGuestbook = new Application_Model_Guestbook();
    $mapGuestbook = new Application_Model_GuestbookMapper();
    
    $queryResult = $mapGuestbook->find(1, $objGuestbook);
    $id = $queryResult->getId();
    $email = $queryResult->getEmail();
    $Comment = $queryResult->getComment();

The mapper<->model interaction used in the quickstart was chosen by the author, and is a matter of personal taste. It is meant for demonstration purposes, and you can modify/extend/enhance it in any way you see fit within your own implementation.
