### Description

If the docktype is set as XHTML\_\* the links are printed as:

[](#)Show me something

The problem is in ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_AjaxLink line 284 when getClosingBracket is called.

$html = '<a' . $this->\_htmlAttribs($attribs) . $this->getClosingBracket() . $label . '';

$this->getClosingBracket() must be replaced by simple ">"
