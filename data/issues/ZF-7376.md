### Description

PHP's fileinfo-Extension has the possibility to take your own Magic-File for MimeType-Determination. In ZF you "can" do this, by setting the magicFile-Option.

The setOptions-Method of Zend\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract converts every setting to bool (Line 554 in recent trunk). This is right for 'ignoreNoFile' or 'useByteString', but not for magicFile.

$this->\_files[$key]['options'][$name] = (boolean) $value;

Due to this, you can't use you own magicFile!
