### Description

I ran into a small issue with Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader, where I have it lazy load some event listeners. The class of one of the listeners was already loaded, and Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader didn't find it. Although it's certainly true that Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader isn't needed for classes that are already loaded, and in almost all cases I've encountered this hasn't come up, it seems worth a call to class\_exists just in case. I wrote a snippet to deal with this which I included below.

class TheOkPhatzby\_Loader\_PluginLoader extends Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader {

 
    public function load($name, $throwExceptions = true)
    {
        if(class_exists($name, false)){
            return $name;
        }
        return parent::load($name, $throwExceptions);
    }   


}

I'm curious about your implementation, as it doesn't seem like it would do what you'd expect.

$name in this case is the "short name" of the plugin being loaded, and as such shouldn't resolve to a full class name -- that assembly happens later in the method, when looping through prefix-paths. Additionally, passing a boolean false to the second argument of class\_exists() would skip autoloading -- which means that even if the class were resolvable via autoloading (typically a big performance boost), it wouldn't be found.

Finally, during load(), we already do a check against class\_exists() per prefix-path, prior to attempting to load any files.

I'm going to mark this as "not an issue", but if you can provide some profiling/benchmarking showing an actual change in performance, feel free to re-open.
