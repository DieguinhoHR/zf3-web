### Description

There is a problem in encodeQuotedPrintable that triggers an E\_NOTICE. Check out line 140.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    139                 // Ensure we are not splitting across an encoded character
    140                 if (($pos = strrpos(substr($str, 0, $ptr), '=')) >= $ptr - 2) {
    141                     $ptr = $pos;
    142                 }
    143     
    144                 // Check if there is a space at the end of the line and rewind
    145                 if ($str[$ptr - 1] == ' ') {
    146                     --$ptr;
    147                 }


If $ptr is 2, and $pos = strrpos(substr($str, 0, $ptr), '=') evaluates to 0, $ptr will be assigned a value of 0.  
 When $str[$ptr - 1] is evaluated, an E\_NOTICE will occur with the message: Uninitialized string offset: -1 in ....

Do you have a snippet of the content that causes the condition? It will help debugging.

Cheers
