### Description

Using addRules() result in some warnings.

reproduce code (example from the manual):

 
    <pre class="literal">
    require_once 'Zend/Console/Getopt.php';
    
    $opts = new Zend_Console_Getopt('abp:');
    $opts->addRules(
      array(
        'verbose|v' => 'Print verbose output'
      )
    );


Output:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    PHP Warning:  preg_match_all() expects parameter 2 to be string, array given in /Users/carsten/Sites/Zend/Console/Getopt.php on line 814

This issue steems from a badly engineered switching between ZEND and GNU Modes.

Zend\_Console\_GetOpt works with two modes on options MODE\_ZEND and MODE\_GNU. What happens in the above example is the following:

In the constructor arguments are created in MODE\_GNU. Console\_GetOpt recognizes that and reverts its setting from MODE\_ZEND (default) to MODE\_GNU. Now when the addRules() is called with v|verbose Console\_GetOpt is still in MODE\_GNU and tries to add the array accordingly which fails.

The fix for this issue is very simple and just consists of not switching to MODE GNU when first adding a string then an array.

I suggest a refactoring to strategy pattern to fix the strange switch statement. I will add an issue for this.
