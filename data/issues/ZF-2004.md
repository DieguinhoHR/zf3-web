### Description

Some reports on the list noted that the system was trying to load a file named 'true.php'. I took a quick look at some code and tracked it down to the following problem.

From svn changeset 6172 on Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract no longer casts the profiler param to a boolean. But since setProfiler() still checks for real booleans the "boolean" strings are not detected anymore and the method just assumes the string "true" to be an identifier for a Profiler class...

One solution that comes to mind is to somewhere cast the value to boolean whenever it should be. Something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $tmpprofiler = strtolower($profiler);
    $profiler = ('true' === $tmpprofiler || 'false' === $tmpprofiler) ? (bool) $tmpprofiler : $profiler;


EDIT: edited example and markup EDIT2: OOOPS. casting 'false' to boolean will result in true. Here's another try:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $profiler = 'true' === $tmpprofiler ? true : ('false' === $tmpprofiler ? false : $profiler);

Only enabling the profiler had been supported previously by a "boolean string" such as "true". Disabling the profiler, on the other hand, with a string value of "false," never worked, so this is not a backward compatibility break. Expecting such behavior comes from a misunderstanding of how the Zend\_Config adapters operate.

Zend\_Config\_Xml always returns string values, no matter the contents.

Zend\_Config\_Ini has the same treatment of special values as [parse\_ini\_file()](http://php.net/parse_ini_file), since the former uses the latter.

Well, one good reason to add support for the string 'false' is the inconsistency with the handling of the boolean/ string trues.

See these Zend\_Db::factory() Use Cases regarding the profiler setting.

Simply passing a boolean false will disable the profiler. Passing a Zend\_Config containing a real boolean value of false for the profiler will disable the profiler. Passing a Zend\_Config containing a string 'false' for the profiler will not disable the profiler.

On the other hand with the true variant all posibilities will enable the profiler.

As for .ini files. When I read the php docs I read about how the boolean keys are handled, but I was still wondering how boolean and string values would be handled. I haven't used any of this, to be honest.
