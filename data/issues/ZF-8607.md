### Description

I'm getting the following error message for the Quick Start Tutorial:

$ zf.sh create action sign guestbook

PHP Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Loader in /Users/conradwt/php.dir/projects/zend-framework/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 31

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Loader in /Users/conradwt/php.dir/projects/zend-framework/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 31

Next, I'm using the lastest version from trunk.

This is an issue of case-sensitivity. Although the zftool capitalises the controller when you create it, it doesn't when you try to use it. Try this:

zf.bat create action sign Guestbook

Also, please test against trunk; Ralph has implemented some changes that should (a) make it possible to lowercase the initial letter (it will then ucfirst() it), as well as (b) warn you about what it's doing when it detects this is the case.

Assigning to Ralph, and marking as a Zend\_Tool issue. The documentation has been revised already, and will release with 1.10.1.

This was fixed as part of the 1.10.x release series.
