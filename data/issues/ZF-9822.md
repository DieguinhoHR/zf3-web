### Description

I have a feature/functionality request to add a "default parameter".

That is, with path /module/controller/action/FOO or /controller/action/FOO, be able to read back FOO as the content of the default parameter.

Said another way: the logic is - if the # path elements = # accounted for/matched/routed things (module, controller, action) + 1, the +1 is the default parameter.

Since you don't have enough to make a parameter/value pair, and the value just sort of hangs off you could easily flag it as a default parameter.

At one point I'd identified that if you go to /mycontroller/myaction/XXXXX and look

in the default route object (Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route), and look at \_values:

[\_values:protected] => Array ( [controller] => mycontroller [action] => myaction [XXXXX] => )

you can see easily that if you skip controller, action, and module, if there's only key one left with no value, it's the default parameter.

I have a number of cases where I want /object/view/X like /profile/view/X or /friend/accept/X and be able to have users type in direct urls if they want to without the needless length of /object/view/username/X or /profile/view/username/X or /friend/accept/username/X or /friend/request/username/X (and on and on).

Rather than having to add a special route (/controller/action/:parameter) or make needlessly long URLs people won't always intuitively guess, it would make sense to have the default paramater option, which doesn't seem too difficult to add?

My opinion is that this is better implemented with routes as it currently stands.

The reasoning for this is when you have the url foo/bar/baz, would that be (module => foo, controller => bar, action => baz) or (controller => foo, action => bar, param => baz) ?

This will only lead to extra confusion, and would lead to an inconsistent workflow for developers.

Keeping this to its current requirement to add an explicit route removes this ambiguity, and provides a consistent workflow.

It was pointed out that in the case where you have ambiguous controller and module naming such as: /foo/bar/baz is that module => foo, controller => bar, action => baz, or controller => foo, action => bar, param => baz

Personally, it seems like a bad idea to have controllers and modules named the same in the first place, and perhaps the default parameter should only be available on the default module to help reduce conflicts. Since the goal is shortening URLs here, once you're already listing /module/controller/action, your URLs are arguably too long to bother shortening.

Either way, it's just an idea.
