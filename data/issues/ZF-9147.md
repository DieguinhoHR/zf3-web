### Description

I search on documentation and www, and I don't found how to set a default radio button to _checked_. I think is a problem with the setValue method.

I tryed with all this posibilities.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $options = array(
                "u" => "u"),
                "uv" => "uv"),
                "ue" => "ue")
            );
            
            
    $multipleSearch = new Zend_Form_Element_Radio("typeuser");
    $multipleSearch->setLabel("defaultSelected")
               ->setMultiOptions($options)
               ->setValue("u");


This method set the attribute "checked" to all the values

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $multipleSearch = new Zend_Form_Element_Radio("typeuser");
    $multipleSearch->setLabel("defaultSelected")
               ->addMultiOption("u","u")->setAttrib("checked","checked")
               ->addMultiOption("uv","uv")
               ->addMultiOption("ue","ue")
               ->setValue("u");

Sorry, I forget it.

This only happens when the form have set the method to _get_

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $format->setMethod('get');

sorry, this is not a bug. Set status to "won't fix" I have a problem with my script.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if($request->isGet())}
      $formData = $request->getParams();
    ...
      $form->populate($formData);


The problem was that $request->isGet() always return true, at least with the controller/action but not form data, so the form is cleared.

I apologiced for the issue.

Not an issue as stated by the opener.
