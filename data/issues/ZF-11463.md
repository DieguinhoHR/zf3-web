Could you provide some sample code showing how you're using Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable, how you handle the exception, and some information on the exception that was thrown? (esp: the class name and stack trace)

We're running into the same issue. It's just a fatal error, there's no exception. We're using Zend Framework 1.9.7

Error occurs on a PHP 5.3.3 server. Same code runs fine on a PHP 5.3.6 server

Error log:

@Tibo: Can you try it on PHP 5.3.3 with the latest ZF release? (or better yet, against SVN trunk)

I can't reproduce the issue against trunk on my dev machine:

Hi,

I've discovered this issue few mins ago and found solution. checked with PHP 5.3.3 and ZF 1.11.7 & 1.11.8

How to reproduce: - use DbTable handler - trigger fatal error - see error message describer above

After debugging noticed that object is already destroyed and it does not have any static properties.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    protected function _getPrimary($id, $type = null)
    {
        $refl = new ReflectionClass($this);
    
        error_log('CHECK: '.print_r($refl->getConstants(),1));
    
        ... rest code ...
    }


 
    <pre class="literal">
    [08-Jul-2011 11:38:31] PHP Fatal error:  xxx in /path/app/module/default/action/IndexController.php on line 26
    [08-Jul-2011 11:38:31] PHP Stack trace: [clipped]
    [08-Jul-2011 11:38:31] CHECK: Array()
    [08-Jul-2011 11:38:31] PHP Fatal error:  Undefined class constant 'PRIMARY_TYPE_NUM' in /path/lib/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/DbTable.php on line 525
    [08-Jul-2011 11:38:31] PHP Stack trace: [clipped]


Workaround is taken from php.net manual.

Pay attention to this note: {panel:title=[http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php)} As of PHP 5.0.5 the write and close handlers are called after object destruction and therefore cannot use objects or throw exceptions. The object destructors can however use sessions. {panel}

By setting shutdown callback as: _register\_shutdown\_function('session\_write\_close');_ in the entry point (index.php) you avoid this issue.

Have a nice day, Nick

UPD. forgot to mention - front controller should be set to throw exceptions, aka in development mode.

I get the same errror. This is quite strange as the user has SELECT rights.

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1142 SELECT command denied to user 'green'@'localhost' for table 'application\_\_users'' in /var/opt/ZendFramework/trunk/library/Zend/Db/Statement/Pdo.php:228

This exception seems to pop up only when another (fatal) error occurs before that.
