Updating project management info.

Are you talking about retrieveing everything inside $\_SESSION regardless of the \_\_ZF settings? or just everything from the session? If you are talking about getting everything from the sesison, why not use $\_SESSION?

I meant the contents of the session without the \_\_ZF part of the array.

This is done easily enough without changes to ZF:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sessionData = $_SESSION; 
    unset($sessionData['__ZF']);
