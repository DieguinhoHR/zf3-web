### Description

I have this ACL situation bellow.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $acl = new Zend_Acl();
            $acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('john'));
            $acl->addResource(new Zend_Acl_Resource('car'));
            
            $acl->allow('john', 'car');
            $acl->allow('john', 'car', 'clean');
            
            $this->assertTrue($acl->isAllowed('john', 'car')); // resolves: true
            
            // john cannot drive
            $acl->deny('john', 'car', 'drive');
            
            // why is this resolving to FALSE?
            // expects to be TRUE because we only denied to DRIVE permission and not the whole resource
            $this->assertTrue($acl->isAllowed('john', 'car')); // resolves: false


My expectation is since we are only denying the specific "drive" permission to user john's resource car why is the acl returning false we I do a check on isAllowed('john', 'car'). I am expecting since i targeted the privilege "drive" that the top level resource will still be true.

Hi,

I comment from line 975 to line 979 and it's work correctly. Why browse byPrivilegeId in allMethodPrivilege?
