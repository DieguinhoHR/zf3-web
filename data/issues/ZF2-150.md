----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Make plug-in's behaviour similar to that of helpers where a "direct()" method is available. Causes the call for that plug-in shorter in the code and provides a default usage case.

If no direct method is available, revert to current behaviour and return the plug-in object.
