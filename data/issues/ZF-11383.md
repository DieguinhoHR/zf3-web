### Description

Put an image file of size ~1.8 MB on S3 in a double-level subdir (i.e. ///file.png
==================================================================================

Test if available via Zend's S3 isObjectAvailable() method (it should return true)
==================================================================================

Now getObjectStream() for the S3 object
=======================================

After drilling down a bit, Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket::read() will sit spinning forever, when the original S3 put took only a few moments
==================================================================================================================================================

Specifically, it gets stuck here:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    for ($read_to = $current_pos + $contentLength;
                     $read_to > $current_pos;
                     $current_pos = ftell($this->socket)) {
                     if($this->out_stream) {
                         if(@stream_copy_to_stream($this->socket, $this->out_stream, $read_to - $current_pos) == 0) {
                             
                             $this->_checkSocketReadTimeout();
                              
                              break;
                         }
                                              AG_Log::logThis("5");
                         
                     } else {
                        $chunk = @fread($this->socket, $read_to - $current_pos);
                        if ($chunk === false || strlen($chunk) === 0) {
                            $this->_checkSocketReadTimeout();
                            break;
                        }
    
                        $response .= $chunk;
                    }
    
                    // Break if the connection ended prematurely
                    if (feof($this->socket)) break;
                }


You'll see that $current\_pos never increases, and thus the for loop becomes an eternal loop.

I've tested using the S3 streamWrapper functionality:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sourceHandle = fopen("s3:://$s3object","r");
            $targetHandle = fopen($localImageToFormat,"w");
            $length = 102400;
            $i=1;
            while(!feof($sourceHandle))
            {   
                $result = fwrite($targetHandle, fread($sourceHandle, $length));
                $i++;
            }
            
            fclose($sourceHandle);
            fclose($targetHandle);


The feof is never received. I'm guessing the problem is that S3 doesn't send a feof.

Please fix this ASAP.

Hi,

Are you sure that the 2nd problem you are describing (the S3 stream wrapper never reaches EOF) is really related to a bug in Zend\_Http\_Client?

It's not true that $current\_pos never increases - as you can see there's a call ``` in the iterator of the for loop. I've tested this with a file on S3 using the Socket adapter and write-to-stream interface, with a 5mb file on a 2nd level directory, this works very well.

Can you try to isolate the problem from the s3 stream wrapper? E.g. provide a piece of code (preferrably with a URL to the exact public file on S3 you are testing with) that gets stuck in an infinite loop, but not using the s3 wrapper - only Zend\_Http\_Client.

If the problem is not in Zend\_Http\_Client, this bug needs to be reassigned.

Philip, is there any follow up on this?

I also see this issue in one of my environments, but not others. I'm suspecting it may be a system configuration setting that is causing it to happen.

We just gave up, as the only way to offer up an example of this happening was to post a file to our S3 and then provide our personal login details...
