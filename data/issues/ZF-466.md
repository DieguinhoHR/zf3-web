Zend\_Xmlrpc\_Client::\_sendRequest() does not send a User-Agent-header which is required in the XML-RPC-standard. See <http://www.xmlrpc.com/spec> (Chapter: Header requirements).

Fix for the user-agent issue. Signed my CLA a few minutes ago, you can apply this patch soon.

Removing the "; charset="-part in the Content-Type header. According to Dave Winers specification this is not recommended. He just writes about "text/xml", not about "text/xml; charset=.\*".

I'll add the charset as well, as the client and server send back utf-8 encoded xml

Fixed in [1426]

The problem with the charset is, that from my point of view, XmlRPC misses some standardization there. I guess we should go with <http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm> make it possible for the user to set the charset and per default use UTF-8, which is much more common in the XML-world.

OK, I took a look at the fix and I would guess it is wrong and worse than before. The XmlRPC-client now sends the incorrect charset because in \_buildRequest(), and ISO-8859-1 XML-payload is generated (line371). So either remove the charset on both side (\_buildRequest() and \_sendRequest()) and leave it completely to the user to supply the correct data or make it UTF-8 everywhere.

I've made it UTF-8 everywhere, as this keeps it compatible then with the xmlrpc server as well as any class that might use i18n charsets.

OK, thank you very much.
