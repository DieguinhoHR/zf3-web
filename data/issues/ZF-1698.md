### Description

The following example code for Zend\_Db\_Table has a where clause in the fetchAll function that uses plain string. This is straight forward, but not exactly safe. I believe the warning note (like those used on previous pages) about quoting is necessary on this page:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.row.html#zend.db.table.row.read.example-rowset)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rowset = $bugs->fetchAll("bug_status = 'NEW'");
