ZF-2844: Validate ini-file
--------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-03-10T12:05:19.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-04-01T03:05:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I think it would be nice to have a validation method for ini-files.

The method would probably check if each line is either a comment or a config directive of type "key = value" using valid syntax (are there other things than comments and directives that could/should be in a ini-file?), and throw exceptions when encountering something else.

This way we could inform the user if they have accidentally created an invalid ini-file.

This is not directly within the scope of Zend\_Config\_Ini/Xml directly as it is not required for reading config files.

I suggest writing proposal for a new family of classes in the Zend\_Config tree to scope out the full feature set of an INI/XML config validation system.
