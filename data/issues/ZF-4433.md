ZF-4433: 0..1 Cardinality should be supported by Zend\_DB\_Table
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently calls to findParentRow() fail when the key is NULL. There should be a way to define 0..1 cardinality for a foreign key relationship.

This could be solved by having a flag which is set when defining the dependency, and checking if the key value is acceptable inside Zend\_DB\_Table\_Abstract before hitting the DB. The result should be either a NULL value is returned if allowed or an Zend\_DB\_Table\_Exception is thrown rather than the current, Zend\_DB\_Select\_Exception being thrown with "No data supplied for parameters in prepared statement."
