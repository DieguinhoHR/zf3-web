### Description

Hello, While using a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text with the attribute 'disabled = true', the value returned by the form is NULL, even if the field is filled using the XHTML value attribute.

Example :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <? 
    class FlowForm extends Zend_Form {
        
        public function __construct($options = null) {
            parent::__construct ( $options );
    
                $int_flowId = new Zend_Form_Element_Text ( 'INT_FLOWID' );
                $int_flowId->setLabel ( 'Flow Id' )->setAttrib('disabled', 'true');
                            ....
    } //End class
    
    class FlowController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    ...
    //Populate the form using database value
    $form->populate ( $formData );
    //display the form
    }
    
    After validating the form, a simple var_dump of my $_POST var :
    array(9) {
      ["INT_FLOWID"]=>
      NULL
    ...
    }


==> $\_POST['INT\_FLOWID'] is always null if the Zend\_Form\_Text has the attrib Disabled = true. If we set the disabled = false afterward using $form->setAttrib('disabled','true') it still doesn't work.

Expected behavior should be to allow the user to retrieve the value of a disabled field.

This is not a ZF problem; it is, in fact, _exactly_ how disabled elements are intended to function according to the W3C specification (). Please refer to the section on disabled elements in the HTML specification ([http://w3.org/TR/html401/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.12.1)), which states explicitly:

- Disabled controls cannot be successful.
