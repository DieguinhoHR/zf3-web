### Description

There's no direct function in FlashMessenger - it means that statement in documentation:

" \*

 
     Finally, most action helpers implement the method direct() which


will call a specific, default method in the helper. In the example of the FlashMessenger, it calls addMessage():

 
     <?php
     $this->_helper->FlashMessenger('We did something in the last request');


"

won't work.

Solution:

public function direct($message) { return $this->addMessage($message); }
