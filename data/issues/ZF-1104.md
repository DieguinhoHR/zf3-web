ZF-1104: Zend\_View::setBasePath() improvement
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-03-21T17:12:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:58.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.2 (06/Apr/07)

### Description

Currently, in Zend\_Controller\_Action, there is a convention implied by initView that the following directory structure exists:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    controllers/
        ...
    views/
        scripts/
        helpers/
        filters/


The idea would be to provide a single method that assumes this convention if the other paths are not explicitly set already. For example if $view->setBasePath('../application/user/views') is set, i can then assume scripts will be in ../application/user/views/scripts, helpers in ../application/user/views/helpers, and filters in ../application/user/views/filters.

This is a convenience method, low priority, but it makes sense to have as it encourages a good convention to follow, as well as suggests a way of doing things that other components (namely zend-controller) prefer.

Added in r4322; Zend\_Controller\_Action::initView() modified to use it in r4323

An addBasePath method (which would do the same thing but using the add\*Path methods) would be pretty cool as well.

setBasePath not include helperClassPrefix param. This break naming convention.
