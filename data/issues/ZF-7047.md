### Description

When trying to create a form using the element factory, I'm facing a little problem. Every Zend\_Form\_Element\_X class has a naming convention where the first letter is in upper case and the rest in lower case. Each one except Zend\_Form\_Element\_MultiCheckbox, and when you try to create this element using the factory, it fails because it should be called using an upper case letter in the middle of the parameter : {quote} // This fails because there's no upper case letter at 'checkbox' $element = $form->createElement('multicheckbox', 'set of elements');

// This works even with no upper case letter at 'select' $element = $form->createElement('multiselect', 'set of elements');

// This works, but seems unnatural and causes problems with automatism $element = $form->createElement('multiCheckbox', 'set of elements'); {quote}

Yes, seems to be a problem related to this.

ZF-5368: {quote}For the record, Multiselect is the one that is misnamed, but we cannot rename it as it would introduce a BC break.{quote}
