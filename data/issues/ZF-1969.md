### Description

I have a controller action called "professionalExperiences", with a relative view script having "professionalExperiences.phtml" as a file name, placed in the correct view folder.

On my local server (Mac OS X with Apache2) everything works: with small caps only, and with camelCaps. On the production server (linux with Apache2), with camelCaps I get the error reported below, while will small caps only it works fine.

==========================================================================================

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script 'account/professionalexperiences.phtml' not found in path (./application/frontend/views/scripts/)' in /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/View/Abstract.php:856 Stack trace: #0 /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/View/Abstract.php(764): Zend\_View\_Abstract->\_script('account/profess...') #1 /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php(742): Zend\_View\_Abstract->render('account/profess...') #2 /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php(763): Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer->renderScript('account/profess...', NULL) #3 /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php(810): Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer->render() #4 /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/Controller/Action/HelperBroker.ph in /home/15219/domains/fresworks.com/html/everydoby/library/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 856

I found out that correcting the filename and writing it in SMALL CAPS ONLY makes the scritp work again. I guess this behaviour is not normal, as if my controller is called "somethingToDoAction()", the corresponding view should be named "somethingToDo.phtml" and not "somethingtodo.phtml".

Am I doing something wrong?

Thank you.

The behaviour described is actually intended. View scripts are normalized to lowercase so that they will work properly on all systems.

That said, new functionality in the incubator will allow you to customize this to meet your needs via Zend\_Filter\_Inflector. This functionality will be released with 1.1.0.
