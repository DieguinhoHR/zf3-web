### Description

Grettings, I used to develop with CodeIgniter i'm studying Zend. I joined a team of programmers that is already using Zend, and my first job is correct a bug. The project uses Flex/AMF with Zend/php . I'm parsing a string date from flex to zend as following:

public function setRgExpedicao($value) { if ($value instanceof Zend\_Date) { $value = $value->toString ( 'Y-m-d' ); } else if (null !== $value && false === is\_string ( $value )) { throw new App\_Exception ( 'Unsupported type or format of dataInicial' ); } $this->\_set ( 'rgExpedicao', $value ); }

The Bug is, in some years like 1953 the date generated always has a day less, for exemple: Flex passes 1953-2-2 Zend\_Date generates 1953-2-1. The bug is very curiuos, some years it generates the correct date like 2011-02-02. Can someone help me?

Per default Zend\_Date utilize the format iso (but allow that be change to format php see the option format\_type). This is your problem 'Y-m-d' change to yyyy-MM-dd.
