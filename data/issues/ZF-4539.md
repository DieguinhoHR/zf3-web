### Description

When you recode a Zend\_Form to a Zend\_Dojo\_Form you have to at $this->setMethod('post'); to keep the code doing the same. Isn't it logical that Zend\_Dojo\_Form also has this default value?

zend\_form:

public function getMethod() { if (null === ($method = $this->getAttrib('method'))) { $method = self::METHOD\_POST; $this->setAttrib('method', $method); } return strtolower($method); }

sets the default value of 'post' for form

Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Form - getoptions calls $method = $element->getMethod(); that's why the default value is set

Zend\_Dojo\_Form inherits from Zend\_Form, and does not override the getMethod() method; Calling $form->getMethod() on a Zend\_Dojo\_Form instance returns 'post', as expected.

but with zend\_form the default ouput is

<

form method="post">

and with zend\_dojo\_form

<

form>
