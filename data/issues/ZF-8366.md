ZF-8366: Zend\_Auth\_Result is not expandable
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-11-21T06:23:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-29T13:47:20.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

The constructor for Zend\_Auth\_Result contains:

 
        if ($code < self::FAILURE_UNCATEGORIZED) {
            $code = self::FAILURE;
        } ...


where:

 
    const FAILURE_UNCATEGORIZED          = -4;


This makes it impossible to create subclasses of this with custom results while still using the parent constructor for future proofing as any result with a lesser value for $code will have it reset to -4.

Suggested fix would be to make FAILURE\_UNCATEGORIZED arbitrarily low - such as -9999.
