### Description

I just changed from version 1.10.0 to version 1.10.1, and encountered Warnings i never saw before. I use WampServer 2.0 for windows and did not change anything in my configuration files, just changed ZF libraries.

Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(G:/phpapplications/lib/ZendFramework-1.10.1/library/G:/phpapplications/myapp/views\\helpers/Partial.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (<a>G:/phpapplications</a>) in G:\\phpapplications\\lib\\ZendFramework-1.10.1\\library\\Zend\\Loader.php on line 190

It seems like every call to methods headTitle(), headLink(), headMeta(), headScript(), partial() on a Zend\_View instance generates theses Warnings...

Could it be a bug ?

I have the same problem, I upgraded from 1.10 to 1.10.1. I just replaced the library/Zend folder and get many error like this:

function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/php/My/Helper/BaseUrl.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/clients/client4/web39) in /var/www/clients/client4/web39/gui/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 190

Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/pear/My/Helper/BaseUrl.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/clients/client4/web39) in /var/www/clients/client4/web39/gui/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 190

I use custom view helper and decorator which worked fine in 1.10. I can't find any place where I add '/usr/share/php' to my path.

open\_basedir limits you to files under a given tree. If you have include\_path entries that are not under that tree, you will get warnings.

Prior to 1.10.1, we used fopen() in Zend\_Loader::isReadable(). In this particular case, any directory on the include\_path that is not under your specified basedir will simply be ignored, and it will only try those directories which are valid. In 1.10.1, to solve other issues that were manifesting, we now loop over the include\_path manually and check paths using is\_readable() -- which triggers the open\_basedir restrictions.

The appropriate solution when using open\_basedir is to ensure that all paths in your include\_path are within the tree specified in that setting. This may mean copying libraries under your project directory.

We could potentially do checks on the open\_basedir INI setting withing isReadable(), but I'm personally of the mind that its up to the developer to ensure appropriate configuration.

Same here

I Changed from 1.8.1 to 1.10.1

Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/pear/./views/helpers/Doctype.php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/usr/share/<a>php:/usr/local/phpapps:/usr/local/cgi:/home/demo</a>) in /usr/local/phpapps/ZendFramework-1.10.1/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 190

so if I add /usr/share/pear/ to my open\_basedir (via apache vhost) it works again but

/usr/share/pear/./views/helpers/Doctype.php is not a file under that destination

/usr/local/phpapps/ZendFramework-1.10.1/library/Zend/View/Helper/Doctype.php /usr/local/phpapps/ZendFramework-1.6.1/library/Zend/View/Helper/Doctype.php /usr/local/phpapps/ZendFramework-1.7.1/library/Zend/View/Helper/Doctype.php /usr/local/phpapps/ZendFramework-1.8.1/library/Zend/View/Helper/Doctype.php

@Max -- /usr/share/php is probably in your global php.ini file, or defined in your vhost.

@Christian: the PluginLoader searches across paths that are provided to it, and checks these against the include\_path as well. Make sure that all paths you add to the PluginLoader are either absolute paths that are within your open\_basedir setting, or on one or more include\_paths (and that all include\_paths are within your open\_basedir setting).

We are unlikely to change the behavior of isReadable() back to use fopen(), as this was basically a bad hack, and clearly was circumventing security policies.

I was having a similar problem. So i raised a ticket (seems to be duplicated of current ticket)

So i found out a potential solution:

This issue, as reported, is better diagnosed in ZF-9263.
