### Description

Hi,

 
                    $this->_helper->redirector->gotoSimple(
                        'message', 'index', 'default'
                    );


Tries to send user to /index/message... instead of /default/index/message

This behavior is expected as the default module ('default') is not repeated. Same as the default controller ('index') and default action ('index') aren't repeated when accessing the root page ('/').

Of course, when you've changed these default module, controllerName and/or action then it's normal it returns /default/index/message

Unit test provided in r22960 in tests/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/RedirectorTest.php
