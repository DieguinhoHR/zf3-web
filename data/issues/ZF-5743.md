### Description

Currently Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Proxy does not support HTTPS calls over a proxy with client certificates.

Here is a patch against the trunk version which allows HTTPS requests with client certificate through a proxy: [http://valokuva.org/patches/zendframework/â€¦](http://valokuva.org/patches/zendframework/proxy_adapter_client_cert.txt)
