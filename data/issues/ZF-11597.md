### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_HtmlElement does not properly substitute double quotes with single quotes in event attribute values. Even if it would work, I think that we should still escape quotes by html entity numbers rather than substituting them from single quotes to double quotes or vice versa. For example JSON standard says that strings are written into double quotes, so substituting from double quotes to single quotes is wrong I think. Please see my patch and let me know if I'm missing something. This issue is also related to ZF-9926.
