### Description

I think it would be more suitable, when the module resource loader (Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules) would be launched automaticly when there are more modules defined then the default module. I could not imagine whats the benefit is to triger this behavior explicitly by e.g. "resources.modules[] = " in the application config. Maybe it makes more sense to suppress this feature by a config directive if its undesired.

The module resource loader is initialized by Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap -- and you need to define a bootstrap for each module you define. However, this is an opt-in situation -- if you need bootstrapping for that module, you add it, but if you don't, then you don't.

While I can see your point about doing this automatically, many developers prefer to opt-in to behavior rather than opt out. I'd prefer to see some discussion on this point on list.

I have to apologize for the unfortunate formulated request.

I meant the resource plugin Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules that initializes available module bootstraps.

As you wrote above the opt-in functionality is to provide a bootstrap for a module or not and this is the way that I also prefer. But in my opinion, the module bootstrap loader (Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Modules) itself should be loaded automatically. This is currently not the case. The module bootstrap loader have to be invoked by "resources.modules[] = " in the application config or somehow else. I hope I didn't spread more confusion this time :-)

Not all ZF applications are modular (I'd venture to guess most aren't, but I'd gladly be proven wrong); modular functionality is completely optional, and a consideration for each individual project to decide. Additionally, all resource plugins shipped with ZF are opt-in only by design. We will not enable this by default at this time.
