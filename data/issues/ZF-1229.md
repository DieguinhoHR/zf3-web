### Description

John Baldock writes:

All the examples I have seen only have one Where condition. What I could have used is either a section of the manual describing the Where clause or some of the examples having multiple conditions, OR as well as AND, to give people a nudge in the right direction. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // multiple conditions seperated by OR
    $nameOne = $table->getAdapter()->quote($nameOne);
    $nameTwo = $table->getAdapter()->quote($nameTwo);
    $where = "name = $nameOne OR name = $nameTwo"; 
    $row = $users->fetchRow($where);
    
    // multiple conditions seperated by AND
    $where[] = $table->getAdapter()->quoteInto('name = ?', $nameOne); 
    $where[] = $table->getAdapter()->quoteInto('name = ?', $nameTwo); 
    $row = $users->fetchRow($where);
