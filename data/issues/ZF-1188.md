### Description

The SQL statements DESCRIBE and SHOW seem to disagree with the prepare() method in the mysqli extension, when running against MySQL 4.1.

The SQL statements work fine against MySQL 5.0.

The SQL statements work fine using the Pdo\_Mysql adapter.

The SQL statements work fine when using the mysqli\_query() method, which does not prepare the statement.

Resolved in revision 4333.

Now DESCRIBE and SHOW TABLES use non-prepared queries.
