ZF-9394: Zend\_Wildfire\_Plugin\_FirePhp tries to log every param passed to a method in stacktrace

### Description

As stated above, the firephp logger tries to log every param passed to a method in the stacktrace.

Using for example Doctrine 2, however, will result in FirePhp eating up more than 128 MB of memory because when the EntityManager - which is the object that contains references to the unit of work etc. - is passed as an argument, the EntityManager will be encoded. (cf. line 409, line 620)

Any important information will be lost in that case.

PS: I think the codes' formatting could need improvement. Does the ZF accept contributions that mostly change a codes' cosmetic?

There is an undocumented feature to filter class members.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $firephp = Zend_Wildfire_Plugin_FirePhp::getInstance();
    $firephp->setObjectFilter("Class_Name", array("member1", "member2"));


Please give that a shot to see if it will reduce the size of your stack traces.

I am contemplating a feature that will filter class members based on doc-block annotations:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @insight filter = On
     */
    protected $variable = null;


I already have working code. It's a matter of merging it but we need to get an idea from the community if this is desirable first.

Ideally we would define a standard for @insight annotations that filter class members based on different criteria to be able to selectively include some members for specific logging calls.

Feel free to create a new ticket and post cosmetic patches. I would be happy to apply them.

Parameter filtering is outside the scope of the implementation at this time.
