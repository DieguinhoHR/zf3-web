### Description

Hi,

In Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row, you can easily fetch dependent table rows and parent rows via foreign keys. Unlike fetchAll(), findDependentRowset() and findParentRow() and findManyToMany() does not allow to set specific where, order, count and offset clauses. The patch attached add these parameters to the formers functions.

Magics function findTables, findParentTables and findTablesViaTables are handled as well.

I use patche Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract for some weeks without problems.

Regards, Étienne.

Hi Etienne - these enhancements have been covered off in the Zend\_Db\_Table Enhancements proposal and are already up-and-running as of ZF1.5 PR1 - I encourage you to try them out and send your feedback.
