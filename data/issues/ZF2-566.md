ZF2-566: Undefined indexes and huge args-data in Zend\\Log\\Formatter\\ExceptionHandler::format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In Zend\\Log\\Formatter\\ExceptionHandler::format the assumtion is made that the indexes _file_, _line_, _class_ and _type_ always exist:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($event<a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-562">'extra']['trace'] as $trace) {
        $outputTrace .= "File  : {$trace['file']}\n"
                      . "Line  : {$trace['line']}\n"
                      . "Func  : {$trace['function']}\n"
                      . "Class : {$trace['class']}\n"
                      . "Type  : " . $this->getType($trace['type']) . "\n"
                      . "Args  : " . print_r($trace['args'], true) . "\n";
    }</a>

But:

The first trace does not contain the _file_ and _line_ indexes
==============================================================

When the trace refers to a function (like call\_user\_func()), the indexes _class_ and _type_ do not exist
==========================================================================================================

print\_r($trace['args'], true) creates a huge, huge string of data because all classes and their descendants are completely added as a string
=============================================================================================================================================

I honestly think the logging (of exceptions) needs a serious rewrite, because there are just so many errors in it that it is unusable in this stage (also see [ZF2-562 and [ZF2-563](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF2-563)).
