### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::getHeader() is case-sensitive whereas it is stated in the http rfc that header field names are case insensitive.

the two following call should return the same:

$response->getHeader('Content-Type'); $response->getHeader('content-type);

see [http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2) for reference

excerpt:

"Each header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive."

There is now such method as Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::getHeader() in the current code base. Shouldn't this issue be closed?

There isn't a getHeader() method, but there should likely be. The bigger issue is that the internal storage _is_ case sensitive, and likely shouldn't be. As it stands currently, when calling setHeader() and asking to overwrite, if the case of the header name differs, a new header will be created and sent.
