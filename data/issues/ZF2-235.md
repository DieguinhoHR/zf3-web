### Description

When I configure a TableGateway, a ResultSet and a RowGateway for one Table, a Circular dependency Exception is Thrown.

Which is the right way to have a custom TableGateway returning a custom ResultSet and custom RowGateway on select?

Could you please provide an example of how you are trying to do it?

Also, just in case you haven't yet, take a look at the last example (5.3.1.7) on the [TableGateway manual page (here)](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/zend.db.tablegateway.html#zend.db.tablegateway.by-example). It shows how to use TableGateway, ResultSet and RowGateway together.

I am aware of this, and will find a solution for beta4.
