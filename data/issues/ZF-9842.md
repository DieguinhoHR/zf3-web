this issue shall be considered as "not a bug" - my bad. While defining routes i was adding params as an array:

controller = index, params = array(slug =>123, ...)

... instead of:

controller = index, slug = 123 ...

Sorry for wasting ur time. Case closed.

It is not a bug. Page configuration was wrong.
