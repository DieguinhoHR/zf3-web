### Description

I have a form which utilize Zend\_Form\_Element\_File like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Forms_Attachment extends Zend_Form
    {
        function init()
        {
            $this->addElement(
                'file',
                'myFile',
                array(
                    'label' => 'Attachment'
                )
            );
        }
    }


The attachment form is utilized as a sub form

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Forms_Products_Delivery extends Zend_Form
    {
            protected $elementDecorators = array(
            'viewHelper',
            array('label', array('tag' => 'p'))
        );
        
        protected $fileDecorators = array(
            'file',
            array('label', array('tag' => 'p'))
        );
        
        protected $hiddenDecorators = array(
            'viewHelper'
        );
        
        protected $subFormDecorators = array(
            'formElements',
            'fieldset'
        );
        function init()
        {
            $attachmentForm = new Forms_Attachment();
            $attachmentForm->setIsArray(true);
            $attachmentForm->setElementDecorators($this->elementDecorators);
            $attachmentForm->setElementDecorators($this->fileDecorators, array('myFile'));
            $attachmentForm->setDecorators($this->subFormDecorators);
            $this->addSubForm($attachmentForm, 'attachments');
        }
    }


when rendering form get this result

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Product Attachments
    


`Attachment`

    

`Title`

    

`Description`

    

while I need to have

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Product Attachments
    


`Attachment`

    

`Title`

    

`Description`

    

The difference is that the file fields is not properly rendered using the Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_File, however I can't use 'viewRender' decorator as it throws an error. If I use "file" decorator in conjunction with 'viewRenderer' I simply get two instances of the file field one incorrect and one correct.

Did you see [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.standardElements.html) and <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5864>.

According to manual file elements can not be rendered as sub-form.

{quote} Note: File elements in Subforms

When you use file elements in subforms you must set unique names. For example, if you name a file element in subform1 "file", you must give any file element in subform2 a different name.

If there are 2 file elements with the same name, the second element is not be displayed or submitted.

Additionally, file elements are not rendered within the sub-form. So when you add a file element into a subform, then the element will be rendered within the main form. {quote}

I think this issue can actually be fixed as non-issue.
