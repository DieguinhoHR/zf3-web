### Description

Currently I have the following directory structure for translation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /languages
      nl
        lang.php
        validation.php
        router.php
      en
        lang.php
        validation.php
        router.php


On bootstrap I want to scan the languages directory and add the listed translation files except for the router.php file. To accomplish this I add router as value for the ignore option. This overrides the default "." value. Because of this Zend\_Translate now tries to add files in the hidden .svn directory as translation files and error notices are displayed. It would be nice if the ignore option could allow an array or regex as value, so you can ignore multiple patterns ($options = array('ignore' => array('.', 'router')).
