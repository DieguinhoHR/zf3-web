### Description

Han Leenders writes:

Hello,

I found a problem in the next piece of code in the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    list($type, $rest) = explode(' ', $row['type_name'], 2);
    
    if (array_key_exists( $primaryKeysResult, $row['column_name'] )) {
           $row['is_primary'] = true;
    } else {
            $row['is_primary'] = false;
    }


1. list gives a notice if $row['type\_name'] contains no whitespace.
2. The arguments in the array\_key\_exists functions seems to be switched.

I'm using the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql as Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Dblib for a linux/apache/freetds + windows/mssql environment.

- PHP has 'extension=pdo\_dblib.so' in php.ini.
- I made a copy of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql named Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Dblib and replaced all occurrences of the string mssql with dblib.

Changes committed in revision 4757 may resolve this issue. But I will leave it open for now until I can verify the changes against unit tests.

The issue reported here is a duplicate of the issue described more extensively in ZF-1360.
