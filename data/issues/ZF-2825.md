Please give your PHP Version, ZF Version or ZF Revision for detailed reproduction.

On current trunk (r8860), both declarations are OK. I've just looked the up in the code. But I haven't try to run some code on it.

I have also viewed such failures when running UnitTests on the complete framework on Windows with the latest trunk yesterday.

I have also received a similar Strict Standards Error. I am using the following:

- PHP Version: _5.2.5_
- ZF Version: _1.5_

Please categorize/fix as needed.

To fix this issue a change similar to the one described in ZF-2628 needs to be made.

Also it may be worth noting that the docblock for the method quoteTableAs() in Zend\_Db\_Pdo\_Oci.php needs to have the following parameter description added:

_@param boolean $auto If true, heed the AUTO\_QUOTE\_IDENTIFIERS config option._

Hope that is helpful.

_Correction:_ I meant _Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci.php_ and not Zend\_Db\_Pdo\_Oci.php.

For Pdo\_Oci fixed in SVN9537 For Oracle fixed in SVN11560
