ZF-12549: Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Files::copyObject sets Content-Type to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

### Description

If you try to copy an object from one cloud files location to another it sets the Content-Type header to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. It should preserve the content type.

This looks like's it's being caused by Zend\_Http\_Client being overzealous with its encType. The workaround in the attached patch sets it to an empty string for PUT requests that have no body, which prevents the incorrect header being added (Z\_H\_C checks encType === null before adding the header).
