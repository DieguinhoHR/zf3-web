### Description

This like you can see it in the summary line would be definately better to add a new page before or after a specified page.

This function could have these params:

addPageAfter($page\_number); or addPageAfter($page\_name);

addPageBefore($page\_number); or addPageBefore($page\_name);

Theses even could be renamed like in a similar way how function in javascript are named.

appendChildPage(); or appendParentPage();

Hi Hans, we have a problem: A page has no number or a name. There is no unique property!

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $container = new Zend_Navigation(array(
        array(
            'label' => 'Home',
            'uri'   => 'home',
        ),
        array(
            'label' => 'Home',
            'uri'   => 'home',
        ),
    ));
    
    echo $view->navigation($container)->menu();


 
    <pre class="highlight">


            <a href="home">Home</a>
        
        
            <a href="home">Home</a>
        

Where do you want to add it? Home or Home? ;-)

I have tested some ideas: We can use the method "findOneBy", fetch the parents and inject the new page. I will write some test cases.

Greetings from and to Germany ;-)

This is a task for ZF2.
