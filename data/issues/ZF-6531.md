### Description

Hi,

From header returns only the name of the sender when the email address of the sender is like : John Doe [john@domain.net](mailto:john@domain.net)

If i retreive the messages with my email reader, the source of the message contains John Doe [john@domain.net](mailto:john@domain.net) but Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Pop3 returns me only 'John Doe'

This is the code i'm using.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Pop3(array('host'     => $myserver,  'user'     => $myusername,  'password' => $mypassword));
    
    foreach ($mail as $i => $message) {
        echo "MESSAGE $i


    ";
        foreach ($message->getHeaders() as $name => $value) {
            if (is_string($value)) {
                echo "$name: $value\n";
                continue;
            }
            foreach ($value as $entry) {
                echo "$name: $entry\n";
            }
        }
        echo "

    ";
    }

I made the test with different mails servers (including gmail) and i have every times the same result

Regards

HJ

Sorry, not a bug. The getFrom() returns the from correctly. 'name '. The browser just don't show the email because it's between < and >. It would be nice to have separate functions to retrieve the sender email and the sender name.

I changed a summary to make it easier to understand.
