### Description

Changes committed in r7577 removed error suppression (@) from the include\_once call in Zend\_Loader:83. This was eliminated in order to make sure that parsing errors, etc are discoverable. The magic method \_\_call handing of 'new\*' for data model class creation depended on these errors being suppressed. Need to suppress these errors in Zend\_Gdata\_App and Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps.
