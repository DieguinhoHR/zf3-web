### Description

In the function "\_debugLog()" exist the line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            Zend_Log::log($message, Zend_Log::LEVEL_DEBUG, 'ZF');


But the method can't execute as static, it must be execute with an object. So the user must give the class an object for logging or if no object was given, it should be use the php output logger (how many other classes do).
