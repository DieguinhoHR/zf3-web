This functionality is already provided, with namespacing features, via the server proxy:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cxn = new Zend_XmlRpc_Client($url);
    $client = $cxn->getProxy();
    $value = $client->foo->bar('baz', 'bat'); // calls foo.bar('baz', 'bat')

I knew but I wanted the client to behave more like Zend\_Rest\_Client... I should have mentioned that. My project have 3 service type (json, xmlrpc and rest) and I'm writing only one set of unit test to test all entry points by swapping the client (XMLRPC and Rest, no JSON client in the framework).

Again, the functionality already exists, and the ServerProxy is a much better solution than the one you propose as it allows descending into namespaces.

Won't fix.
