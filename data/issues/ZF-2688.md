ZF-2688: Zend\_View\_Abstract not handling URI style paths
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-02-19T08:02:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-08-31T09:14:37.000+0000 Status: Postponed Fix version(s):

### Description

In all (most?) of the path handling routines in Zend\_View, it is assumed that paths are in the form of /some/path for unix and C:\\some\\path for windows. There are not allowances for using URI stlye paths. (file:// or mystreamhandler://)

In my code I have a custom stream handler that provides the view templates and I found a way to force Zend\_View to work with it while on a Unix based system, since DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR = / on those systems. Now that I have a windows based dev box, the fact that DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR = \\ is causing my code to no longer work. This is not a case of bad programming on my part though. Zend\_View just assumes that you will never use URI style paths, but that is the only way to get access to my custom stream handler.

Internally, Zend\_View simply uses include() to pull in a view script, after first resolving it to one of the paths in its internal stack. As such, it should be able to handle any of the URL fopen wrappers... but only if we support those for the registered paths.

I see this as an edge case, however; most developers will be working with paths in the local filesystem and not require stream wrappers. Unless you're willing to provide a patch showing a proof-of-concept or the issue receives many votes, we likely will not implement it.

Modified from bug to feature request.

I have to say that is a very disappointing response.

Using any valid file path shouldn't be a feature request, it should be expected behavior. If I can send it to the include function, then the internal Zend\_View functions should handle it.

I have patched Zend\_View\_Abstract to simply always use the unix style separator, as a simple stop-gap solution. However, since it is not a 'real' solution I will not submit it as a patch.

I stand by my earlier classification, this is a BUG not a feature request.

Nobody else has commented on this issue, and there are no watchers or votes on it. I've seen no related bugs come through the issue tracker.

For the 1.6.0 release, I already have plans to modify Zend\_View\_Abstract to utilize Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader and Zend\_Filter\_Inflector for resolving helper/filter paths and classes -- primarily so that we do not have multiple solutions to a standard framework issue (plugins). This will likely resolve any issues you are seeing.

I'm marking this as an _improvement_, not a bug, as you are not providing reproduce code and as the behaviour you're describing was never an intended behaviour of Zend\_View.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

At current, Zend\_View\_Abstract is very much tied to the filesystem, i am gonna mark as postponed, and reassign to matthew. This might be something to consider at 2.0 time.
