### Description

As we are approaching the first release I figured I'd bring this to someones attention. I honestly don't know the best way to handle this type of report so I've attached a link to an image which clearly shows the errors I'm attempting to report. Maybe just an IDE flaw, but you be the judge.

This image contains the actual error, Path to File, File Name, and Line Number

Currently I've only found 9 errors which consists of the Feed and View

Sorry I should of added that I looked at a few of these errors and for example the registerNamespaces() error. In the file I see it's labeled as \_registerNamespaces() which I can only assume should now be registerNamespaces(). I wasn't certain if submitting a PR to fix that would be good in this case as I'm unaware if changing the function name would cause a BC Break.
