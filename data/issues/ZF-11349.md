This patch does not work, reverting.

The improvement here is much harder than this. Changes must be run through the ApplicationConfigFile Context and then written from that context.

Currently, ApplicationConfigFile's removeItem() does not search for entire "trees" of values, it searches for specific values. If you'd like to explore a better patch, I can help you, find me on #zftalk.dev.
