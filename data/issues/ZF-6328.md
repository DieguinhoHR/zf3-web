ZF-6328: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File too many file reads
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Performance Improvement Created: 2009-04-16T13:23:13.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-24T12:53:13.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If cache is using files, each time cache entry is required, two requests to file system are performed (is\_file and fopen). When I added caching to Locale, number of requests was enormous and server CPU load was unacceptable.

The solution I used: 1. in class Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File I added private static $ FILE\_CACHE = array (); 2. in method \_fileGetContents I added at the very beginning if (isset (self:: $ FILE\_CACHE [$ file]) & & self:: $ FILE\_CACHE [$ file])) { return self:: $ FILE\_CACHE [$ file]; } 3. before the return of this method I added self:: $ FILE\_CACHE [$ file] = $ result;

I am new to Zend Framework and just want to share my experience.

Is this solution good / bad? Should it be added to Zend Framework?

I don't like to have a big array which will grow without limit

If you have a loop which plays with thousands of cache files...

By the way, if you have performance issues, use Apc or Memcache backend
