ZF-10211: Zend\_Json\_Server unable to pass objects

### Description

Zend\_Json\_Server cannot handle objects that are returned from a result. So if a mapper returns an object it ends up not getting serialized. This patch will check to see if it's an object (or array of objects), check to see if it has a toArray() method and calls it, or casts it to (array) if toArray() doesn't exist.

Patch for library/Zend/Json/Server/Response.php: 181d180 < $result = $this->\_convertObjectToArray($this->getResult()); 183c182

< 'result' => $result,
