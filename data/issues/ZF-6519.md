ZF-6519: Module Bootstrap Class never gets initialized

### Description

If i try to create a Bootstrap class for a module ( extending the Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap ) that class never gets initialized during the bootstrap process. (with the current 1.8 release)

Checking out the current trunk version, i get a errormessage:

Fatal error: Call to a member function getControllerDirectory() on a non-object in /var/www/vhosts/development.groundcontrol.at/library/Zend/Application/Resource/Modules.php on line 65

If you look at Zend\_Application\_Module\_Bootstrap line 65: $front = $bootstrap->frontController; $front is always null;

Seems the overloading doesn't return the correct value for the front controller resource.

Correcting that line to: $front = $bootstrap->getResource('frontController'); works fine.

Greets, Gernot

You're not using the official 1.8.0 release; the code you allude to is from the preview release, and was fixed prior to the 1.8 beta 1 release.

Hi Matthew,

Sorry for that. But I Still don't get it right... If I download the 1.8.0-minimal.zip from it's still the same issue:

- @version $Id: Modules.php 14896 2009-04-14 21:09:43Z matthew $ $bootstrap = $this->getBootstrap(); $bootstrap->bootstrap('frontcontroller'); $front = $bootstrap->frontController;

checkout from the trunk: (says also rev. 14896 ) completely the same: $bootstrap = $this->getBootstrap(); $bootstrap->bootstrap('frontcontroller'); $front = $bootstrap->frontController;

Maybe I only need some sleep...

Ugh -- I see the issue. I'm correcting it now.

Interestingly, the FrontController resource _does_ set the frontController property of the bootstrap in current trunk and the 1.8 release branch. I'm correcting the Modules resource to use getResource('FrontController'), however, as it's more correct. Either way, the same tests pass.

I've added additional tests to ensure that the front controller is indeed available to the modules resource, and also updated the code to pull the resource using getResource() (though the previous incarnation still worked). The changes will propagate with 1.8.1.

Thanks Matthew, works perfectly now.
