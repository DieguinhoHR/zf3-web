### Description

It would be great to be able to add some features (methods and members) to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract and to use it on derived classes such as Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Ibm, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oracle, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysqli, ...

If I ever dare to extends Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract by doing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    abstract class Cduv_Db_Adapter_Abstract extends Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
    {
        public function myMethod ($arg)
        {
            //some work
        }
    }


I can't use the method myMethod() because I cannot have an instance of Cduv\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract unless I create a class deriving from it (let's say Cduv\_Db\_Adapter), but this would leave me no choice to implements all abstract methods of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract (by an awful copy/paste).

It seems every components of the Zend\_Db\_Adapter package are too tied altogether.

I don't know if it's still the case in Zend Framework 2.0 models but if a solution exists for 1.x: I didn't succeeded to find it.

I am not sure where to start here.

Generally, if you want to add vendor specific functionality to an adapter, you'd extend the actual adapter. So, Your\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli would extends Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli and you'd instantiate that type. What you are asking for here is not possible in PHP (or Java, or any language that follows a multiple interface, single inheritance class/type/object model).

In ZF 2.0, there will be a "plugin" architecture where you'll be able to hook into events that happen at specific times, for example pre-query and post-query time.

My question to you is this: what do you need the abstract adapter to do that it currently does not do? And, is the functionality you are seeking within the domain of the problem that the Adapter is attempting to solve?

I am inclined to close as not-an-issue.
