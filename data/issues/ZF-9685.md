### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client \_openTempStream() calls "$this->close". But, it is not undefiend.

So errors occurred. "Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Http\_Client::close() in /usr/share/php/Zend/Http/Client.php on line 915"

Is this not "$this->getAdapter()->close()" ?

added a close() method in the Zend\_Http\_Client class, including some tests

Re-did fix to call $this->adapter->close() instead, removed the newly-added close() method. Other than that all other modifications and unit tests by DragonBE were kept (thanks!)

Resolved in CS-21951, merged to release branch in CS-21952
