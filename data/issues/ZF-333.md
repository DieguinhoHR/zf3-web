### Description

Maybe putting three parameters for the testDate on filter\_input. I think this could be an interesting improvement if the date does not came from a single form element (for example : if the value came from 3 select/option elements)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filterPost = new Zend_Filter_Input($_POST);
    if ($date = $filterPost->testDate('month','day','year'))
    {
       //data is ok
    }
    else
    {
       //date is not ok
    }

Should we use a the same method name with dynamic parameters or should we create a new method name, something like testDateMDY, to avoid confusion on how to use the testDate() method?

If we were to make the testDate method have dynamic parameters, one parameter would mean expecting the date as one field, two parameters would mean that the month and year are being passed (common in credit card validation), and three parameters would mean that m,d, and Y are being passed separately.

Any other ideas/comments?

I thought a lot about this when writing it and decided to implement a strict input format and wait and see what other people thought. I think allowing different formats is fine as long as it doesn't create any ambiguity or confusion. Avoiding confusion is the part I was torn on.

Zend\_Filter\_Input::testDate() is deprecated as of 0.8.0 in favor of Zend\_Validate\_Date. As a side note, Zend\_Validate\_Date delegates to Zend\_Locale\_Format, and the format and locale options are available to control validation behavior. If these are insufficient or inappropriate for many people, we will need to address this separately.

Zend\_Validate\_Date has been updated not to use Zend\_Locale, simplifying the former's use to its original implementation that accepted dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. If the year, month, and day come from three different variables, simply concatenate them, as in "$year-$month-$day".
