### Description

There is plenty of documentation on how to get a $response object, but none on what to do with it once you have it. isError(), isSuccessful(), isRedirect, getBody(), getRawBody(), etc..., none of these appear in the documentation.

Well, these methods are plainly usefull for testings purposes. that should help : [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/~matthew/Zend_Controller+Test+Cases)

Documentation should soon be updated I think ^^

How about this: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.response.html) ?

This have been around since before 1.0 ;)

Oh yes, this will work perfectly.

Wait, did you just upload that to make me look like an idiot. You made up that 1.0 thing ;)

Thanks.

np... it's always better to report and find out it has been working than not to report at all ;)

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
