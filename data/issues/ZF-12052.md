### Description

Hello, I've tried to delete all the entries of a db table, and according to sql commands if the "where" is not setted, all is removed. But in Zend, if I do a $dbTable->delete() it asks for a "where" parameter. But in the parent class, "Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract", this parameter is optional, so I have to use "@$dbTable->delete()" to do that. I think this parameter should be optional in the other "Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract", right? We are using the trunk version. Thanks!

I'm not sure about the backwards-compatibility issues around changing Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::delete to empty the table if no parameters are given. I workaround for this could be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // See: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.delete">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…</a>
    // See: <a href="http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Delete-all-the-rows-of-a-table-tp657469p657472.html">http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…</a>
    $table = new Bugs();
    $table->delete('1');


I'm not sure if this is completely portable across all RDBMSes supported by Zend\_Db.

I've attached a patch which implements your suggestion...just in case the CR Team deems your request a valid one for ZFv1.12

Do we really want to give people the ability to delete their entire table with a single API call? I'd opt for keeping the current signature as at least, if they really want to delete the whole table, they have to do something like $table->delete(new Zend\_Db\_Expr('1 = 1')); (not sure if that actually works). Reason being, is that if somehow they coded: $table->delete($someSpec), and spec turns out to be empty, then everything is gone.

I'd have to check the internals, but suggesting that where is optional seems dangerous.

@Ralph: Valid point. The OP was also arguing for consistency, as Zend\_Db\_Adapter::delete allows an empty where condition

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // If $param is empty, delete all rows in the table
    $table->getAdapter()->delete('table', $param);


At any rate, it's a trivial issue with a simple workaround, so I don't think it's necessary to pursue it.

Closing as Won't Fix. There is a chance that this change could break backwards-compatibility (a logic error resulting in an empty where clause would currently just emit an erorr, but after patch is applied it would empty the table). As well, an easy-to-use and commonly known workaround exists.
