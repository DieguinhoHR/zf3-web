ZF-7157: Zend\_Json should support JavaScript comments
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently if you try and decode a JSON value that contains a comment like:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    // comment
    {"foo": "bar"}


The result is a single string property (zend\_debug::dump):

 
    <pre class="literal">
    string '// comment
    {"foo": "bar"}' (length=25)


It would be nice if Zend\_Json were able to identify and strip the "//" and /\* \*/" based comments prior to decoding so that JSON strings with comments would parse as expected.

I need a little input before working on this. First, is ext/json enabled in your PHP installation? Second, how are you decoding JSON values -- via Zend\_Json::decode()? or are you going straight to Zend\_Json\_Decoder?

I ask the questions as I'm trying to determine if the problem exists in Zend\_Json, or upstream in ext/json.

Im using Zend\_Json::decode() and leveraging the Json module (1.2.1). Im using PHP 5.2.6 and ZF 1.8.3

Zend\_Json::decode() defaults to using ext/json when enabled -- which means your issue is upstream. Please report it at <http://bugs.php.net/>

Closing as "Won't Fix" as the issue is upstream.
