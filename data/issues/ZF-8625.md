### Description

First of all, autocomplete is a feature that has been switched from JQuery Core to a plugin. So if you don't download the plugin, the autocomplete() view helper wont work at all.

Second : it looks like the API of autocomplete has changed. The 'url' parameter has become a real parameter. The actual view helper does not take care of the new parameters and API changes, producing a wrong html code which cant be used with autocomplete anymore.

The patch is attached

AutoComplete is re-introduced with jQuery UI 1.8 - I change the API of the helper to comply with that one.
