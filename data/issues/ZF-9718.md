### Description

Hi!

I would like the method Zend\_View::addFilter() to accept anything inheriting Zend\_Filter\_Interface because a filters' dependencies should not be hidden inside of Zend\_View.

As it is now, I can not seem to add an instance of my own filter to be used while rendering the view, but I have to filter the rendered view. This approach is a bit backwards especially since Zend\_View is supposed to support filters.

Suggestions:

Bypass the dynamic loading of Zend\_View::addFilter() if passed anything implementing Zend\_Filter\_Interface ..or Remake the signature of Zend\_View::addFilter() to accept constructor injection like: bq.$view->addFilter(array('My\_Filter' => array('aConstructorOption' => 3, 'anotherOption' => 5)));
