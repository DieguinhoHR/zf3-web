ZF-741: Invalid chunk size in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-11T18:21:34.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:39.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

From times to times I get this exception raised when requesting this uri : <http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebsitePlanning> The exact error message is "Invalid chunk size "<" unable to read chunked body'"

Here is a sample code I use to request this uri :


    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setUri("http://feeds.feedburner.com/WebsitePlanning");
    $response = $client->request('GET');
    ?>

It is very weird because the exception is not always raised so I really do not know what could cause such issue. BTW I have tried to use file\_get\_contents function and it always returns a valid result so I think it is an issue into to socket adapter used by the http client....or maybe file\_get\_contents has a better handling of buggy responses ?

I'm still trying to figure out what causes this - seems to be some kind of uncommon server behavior. I've noticed that the server ignores the 'Connection: close' request header and still replies with a 'Connection: keep-alive' response header.

In the mean time, a working work-around seems to be forcing the HTTP/1.0 protocol version, which causes the server to obey "Connection: close" request headers. You can do that by setting this option:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$client->setConfig(array(
        'httpversion' => Zend_Http_Client::HTTP_0 
    ));

before sending the request.

After minor modifications to Socket.php I think I solved the problem, although I am not sure (I can only prove this statistically - I am too tired right now to think why this solution works ;)

Please try with revision 2757 or later and let me know if this works better now.
