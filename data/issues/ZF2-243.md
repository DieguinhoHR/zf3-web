### Description

GLOB\_BRACE is used for a glob() call in the ConfigListener when merging configurations. This dependency cannot be met on all operating systems, particularly AIX (IBMi).

An application using the ConfigListener fails with a fatal error:

 
    <pre class="literal">[27-Mar-2012 17:53:34] PHP Notice: Use of undefined constant GLOB_BRACE - assumed 'GLOB_BRACE' in /usr/local/zendsvr/gui.new/vendor/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Module/Listener/ConfigListener.php on line 233

This looks kinda old. Evan, didn't we switch to \\GlobIterator for that reason?

By the way, Yonni, did you test with the current beta3 or an old version?

Forked SkeletonApplication and Zf2 and sent pull requests: [https://github.com/zendframework/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/pull/49) <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/980>

Tested with beta3, found a TODO in ConfigListener so I took it up with Matthew. According to him globiterators were inapplicable, so I applied a simpler solution.

I had discussed this with Matthew and others on IRC. We discovered that \\GlobIterator didn't solve the issue like we had anticipated it would (it doesn't support GLOB\_BRACE at all, actually).

IIRC, Matthew was thinking GLOB\_BRACE wouldn't work on Windows, but it turns out it does. It seems to only be non-GNU systems like Solaris that don't support it and I think the consensus was that people on those systems can easily change the glob pattern (and we could document such). Though, I'm unsure if passing GLOB\_BRACE as a flag throws a warning or anything on non-GNU systems. Anyway, I suppose I don't mind changing this to two globs though simply to maintain a higher level of compatibility if there's no objections.

I could come up with a fallback solution so GLOB\_BRACE can still be used, even on non-GNU systems.

One more problematic point: AIX glob calls seem to ignore cwd - I can only get correct results when we use an absolute path. When testing, I verified with getcwd that we are in the document root, etc...

I'm not really sure there's much we can do to fix the AIX glob cwd issue...

It would seem to me that there are three options in this case:

1) Simply adjust the glob paths to be absolute after cloning the skeleton. 2) Use Zend\\Module\\Listener\\ConfigListener::addConfigStaticPaths() to add each config file explicitly instead of addConfigGlobPaths() to add glob patterns. 3) Re-implement glob() completely in PHP, which I'd prefer we not do.

This issue is resolved via [PR 983](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/983) and [PR 1419](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/1419).

 

 

Posted by Yonni Mendes (yonman) on 2012-06-24T15:11:10.000+0000

The fix in PR 983 seem to work when I tested it in our IBMi machine but I had to create absolute paths for it to work. It seems that AIX glob works only with static paths - otherwise you get empty results and an empty configuration.

Should this issue be reopened for this? or should I create a new issue?

I'm re-opening and assigning to Ben Scholzen. Perhaps there is something he can add to our Zend\\Stdlib\\Glob class to account for this.
