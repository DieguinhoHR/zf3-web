As discussed in #zftalk.dev i refactored Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_BigInteger because some major bugs made this class unusable.

Because of some big mistakes in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_BigInteger and it's tests it was not possible to not break backward compatibility.

Fixed in r23363.

Only tests are merged to branch, Should be done the merged of the correction also or revert tests flawed of the branch already that this issue break BC.
