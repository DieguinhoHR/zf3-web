### Description

It would be great if there were a Decorator available in the core that was able to render the contents of a view script (Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Partial seems logical?). The use case would be for rendering complex form components that require excess markup or complex logic.

The advantage of implementing this as a Decorator is that it would allow developers to easily add such functionality to their Zend\_Form\_Element objects without the need to subclass an existing Decorator.

The Decorator would use Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial to render the contents of a view script and append it to the current Elements content using the normal Decorator conventions (APPEND, PREPEND etc.). Variables could be passed through to the view script via the Decorators Options to allow for configuring the view script on the fly.
