### Description

The following line-example below should throw an exception:

$myTable->getAdapter()->quoteInto( 'id', $code->logboek\_msg\_id )

first parameter should contain a quotation mark if a second parameter is present.

If a programmer forget the quotation mark, no errors will be trhown and this can cause random errors in the DB and personally, it is quite hard to debug and see the error.
