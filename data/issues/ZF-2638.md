ZF-2638: Zend\_View\_Abstract - helper/filter class loading error

### Description

I noticed an error while using the form view helpers -- the method _\_loadClass_ in Zend\_View\_Abstract has this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($this->$classLoaded[$name])) {
        return $this->$classLoaded[$name];
    }


Due to the operator priorities, the _isset_ is always returning true. I had to resolve the ambiguity by writing:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($this->{$classLoaded}[$name])) {
        return $this->{$classLoaded}[$name];
    }

Applied in current trunk.
