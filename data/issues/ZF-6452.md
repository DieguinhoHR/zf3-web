### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.quick-start.html)

The index.php should include to path to library:

set\_include\_path(.....);

Otherwise won't work...
-----------------------

<?php // Define path to application directory defined('APPLICATION\_PATH') || define('APPLICATION\_PATH', realpath(dirname(**FILE**) . '/../application'));

// Define application environment defined('APPLICATION\_ENV') || define('APPLICATION\_ENV', (getenv('APPLICATION\_ENV') ? getenv('APPLICATION\_ENV') : 'production'));

/\*\* Zend\_Application \*/ require\_once 'Zend/Application.php';

// Create application, bootstrap, and run $application = new Zend\_Application( APPLICATION\_ENV, APPLICATION\_PATH . '/configs/application.ini' ); $application->bootstrap(); ->run();

As noted on list, there is more than one way to set the include\_path. This quick start makes the assumption that ZF is on your include\_path already; others show alternate ways to configure it. The Quick Start on the ZF site is being updated for 1.8 to show setting the include\_path from the index.php. I see no reason to change the documentation here, as that subject is one for a tutorial.
