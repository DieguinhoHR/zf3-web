### Description

Just downloaded the 1.8 Preview and discovered a bug. The error I got was:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_Controller::\_getRequest() in Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Controller.php on line 85

I think that line (85) should be:

 
        if ($this->_registry->getRequest()->isPretend()) {


Instead of:

 
        if ($this->_getRequest()->isPretend()) {

This was fixed as part of the update in r15083.

If you see this issue in trunk and 1.8 please reopen, but I think its fixed now.
