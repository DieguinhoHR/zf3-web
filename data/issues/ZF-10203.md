1. Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryToken: On token category TC\_WORD the token will be converted to lowercase on ever IF-statement
2. if (count($array) == 0) -> if (!$array)
3. unset supports to destroy more than one variable at once
4. What is count(end($requiredVectors)) ? -> in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Boolean & Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Phrase
5. checking different rules only if one base rule matches -> in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Boolean starting on line 657
6. Call extension\_loaded('bitset') only once -> in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_SegmentInfo

Hello, Marc. How much can we save mili-seconds by aggregation of unset() calls ?

If some advantage exists, following classes may need to be patched rather than Search class.. Zend/Controller/Action/HelperBroker/PriorityStack.php Zend/Controller/Router/Route/Regex.php Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php Zend/Loader/Autoloader/Resource.php Zend/Locale.php

Hi Satoru,

Thats only a micro optimization. Sure, we can patch all components but it makes only sense to work on where performance is an issue.

Hi, Marc. Totally I can agree with you ;)
