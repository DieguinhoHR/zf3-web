### Description

Compare [the manual section](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.writer.html#zend.feed.writer.setting.entry.data.points) to [the phpdocs](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.11/_Feed_Writer_Entry.html#Zend_Feed_Writer_Entry).

- Manual says there's a setFeedLinks(), but there isn't.
- -Manual says there's setCategories(), it probably should say addCategories().-
- Manual doesn't mention setEnclosure().

The setCategories() issue was separately reported as ZF-11449, and has been fixed.
