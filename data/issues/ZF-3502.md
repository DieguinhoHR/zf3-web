ZF-3502: FormElement::\_getInfo doesn't properly check value of 'disable' attribute

### Description

Currently, FormElement::\_getInfo() doesn't actually check the value of the 'disable' attribute in the attribs array. Instead, it only checks to see if it exists and is a scalar value, and if so, it assumes that you want to disable the element, which is certainly not the case when, for example, disable is set to false.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (isset($info['attribs']['disable']) 
                && is_scalar($info['attribs']['disable'])) 


Should be something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (isset($info['attribs']['disable'])
                && is_scalar($info['attribs']['disable'])  && !!$info['attribs']['disable'])


Also, it seems a little weird that we're using the word 'disable' where in HTML it is 'disabled', but that might be something for another bug. :)

Set the wrong priority initially. Sorry for the bugspam.

This has been resolved with r11871 ([http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=11871)) and is a duplicate of <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3505>
