### Description

For some recent RESTful architecture development I was working on, I came across the need to to use Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http to check for other HTTP requests than POST and to also access the raw entity body of the posted or put request. To achieve this, we extended Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http and added the needed methods and then set the Zend Framework request to our child class using the front controller's setRequest() method. However, I think these methods should be incorporated back into the Zend Framework itself.

Patch follows...

Scheduling for 1.5.0 RC2

Committed to trunk and 1.5 release branch, with one change: getEntityBody() was changed to getRawBody() to more closely follow PHP docs and typical descriptions of that particular request usage.

Documentation was commited to the request documentation to cover the new functionality.

Changing the name to getRawBody() is fine since all the PHP documentation already refers to it as the "raw" body. Though, my usage of "entity" more properly reflects the terminology used by RFC 2616, specifically <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-7>. There is no distinction in HTTP of "raw" versus "processed" data in the entity body. This distinction occurs in PHP because of the $\_POST superglobal array that processes the url-encoded entity body and constructs a PHP array out the parameters.

Just wanted to give my reasoning for using "entity" instead of "raw." :-)
