### Description

If an element's value is an array, the filters are recursively applied to each array value. But sometime you may need to have a filter to work directly on an array (to remove elements on some conditions for example)

I need some code -- what exactly do you want to accomplish, and how does Zend\_Form\_Element prevent you from accomplishing it?

Fore example if you have a many to many table to describe which kind of bed and how many of them you have in a hotel bedroom. You display in your form all the bed's type with a checkbox and a select with a array notation like this.

beds[2][id] beds[2][num]

beds[3][id] beds[3][num]

beds[4][id] beds[4][num]

When you submit the form you will get all the beds type in the $\_POST['beds'] var. When the checkbox haven't been checked the key $beds[index][id] won't be set. So you may want a custom filter to remove the unchecked elements.

But as Zend\_Filter\_Element::getValue() is construct it will prevent to have the filter working because it will call the filter for each elements of the array

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Zend_Filter_Element::getValue()
    array_walk_recursive($valueFiltered, array($this, '_filterValue'));


while we would like the plain array to be passed to the filter.

Hope my English is not too obscure :)

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Use getRawValue() to pull the plain, infiltered array, which you can then pass to your own custom filter.

Please consider this again, Matthew.

It really is an issue, especially because Zend\_Form\_Element is IMPOSSIBLE to modify without re-implementing all the Zend\_Form\_Element\_\* classes.

The problem is that some of us have defined elements that are arrays by themselves, and instead of filtering them as a whole, this filters their individual values.

E.g. an element that represents a date and is an array with keys day/month/year. Instead of filtering the date as a whole, this would run the filters on the individual date components.

I need a concrete use case: what is the data being filtered, how the filter would be attached, and what the expected outcome will be. I understand what you're getting at, but I'm not going to take a stab in the dark at implementing it without these details.

I'll try to provide you with a clear example, but before I do so, if you don't mind, can you tell me WHY is the recursion there at all? Which elements return recursive values that need recursive filtering?

Just so I see both sides of the problem.

Look through the issue tracker; the feature was added by user request.

Seems I can't find the ticket... doesn't matter.

The problem is difficult to demonstrate, because it's conceptual and you run into it only after you've extended Zend\_Form\_Element and the renderers quite a bit. Nevertheless, I'll try to give you an example (it seems to me that both me and the OP were doing a similar thing). Please bear with me, this is long :)

Added to Zend\_Form is the functionality for two things:

- _compound elements_ (or "objects" if you will), which are represented in HTML using PHP array notation (object[property]). This is Zend\_Form\_Element\_Person in this example.


  - _dynamic arrays of elements_ (either scalar or objects). An array of scalars (e.g. text inputs) would be represented in HTML as text[0], text[1],... An array of objects would be represented as object[0][propA], object[0][propB], object[1][propA], object[1][propB]... Thanks to Zend\_Form's architecture, you can add array support pretty easily.

The conceptual problem only shows itself when you use both in combination.

This all works _really_ well, and with very little Javascript you can even let the user customize the number of items in the array without reloading a page.

(If you contact me privately, I'd be glad to show you how cool this all works out in practice (unfortunately, I can't yet publicly publish it), so perhaps you can keep it in mind for Zend\_Form 2.0 :).)

Here's a VERY basic example (it assumes arrays have only one member). It shows a custom "object element", Person. The form then asks you for details about your father, your mother, and your siblings (for the purposes of the example, you can only specify one).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    set_include_path('library' . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    class Zend_Form_Element_Person extends Zend_Form_Element_Xhtml {
        public function render(Zend_View_Interface $view = null) {
            $name = $this->getFullyQualifiedName();
            $name = str_replace('[]', '[0]', $name); // in reality would have to draw multiple sets in a loop, each with a different index, if $this->isArray()
            return $name .':<br></br>'                         
                 . ' - Name: <br></br>'
                 . ' - Age: <br></br>'
                 . ' - Favorite color: <br></br><br></br>';
        }
    }
    
    if ($_POST) {
        echo '


    '.htmlspecialchars(print_r($_POST,true)).'

    ';   
    }
    
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->setView(new Zend_View());
    $form->addElement('person', 'father');
    $form->addElement('person', 'mother');
    $form->addElement('person', 'siblings', array('isArray'=>true));                            
    $form->addElement('submit', 'submit');
    echo $form->render();
    

You can see it in action here: <http://jaka.kubje.org/temp/ZF-2728/>

Now if you enter details about your family, the $\_POST will look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [father] => Array
            (
                [name] => John Doe
                [age] => 50
                [favoriteColor] => blue
            )
    
        [mother] => Array
            (
                [name] => Jane Doe
                [age] => 48
                [favoriteColor] => red
            )
    
        [siblings] => Array
            (
                [0] => Array
                    (
                        [name] => Jackie Doe
                        [age] => 18
                        [favoriteColor] => pink
                    )
    
            )
    
        [submit] => submit
    )


Now you make My\_Filter\_Person, which works on a person as a whole.

The filtering code in Zend\_Form\_Element is the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
             if ($this->isArray() && is_array($valueFiltered)) {
                 array_walk_recursive($valueFiltered, array($this, '_filterValue'));
             } else {
                 $this->_filterValue($valueFiltered, $valueFiltered);
             }


When filtering the father and mother elements, which are not arrays, the validator will receive an "object" like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        [father] => Array
            (
                [name] => John Doe
                [age] => 50
                [favoriteColor] => blue
            )


This works as expected.

With siblings, which is an array, you'd expect the filter to be run multiple times, once for each value. And indeed, this is how it works for arrays of scalars.

However for arrays of objects, it's a different story. If array\_walk were used, the filter would run multiple times, once for each object, just like for father and mother element, and all would be fine and dandy. Unfortunately array\_walk\_recursive is used, which causes filters to run not only on first-level values, but also descends into children, which effectively runs them on object properties.

Hope this demonstrates it well enough.

Oh and btw, this is also how validators are run in isValid() - once per value. They do not recurse down the values.

 

 

Posted by Laurent Melmoux (laurent melmoux) on 2008-11-21T04:31:23.000+0000

Well there is some USE CASE where the recursive behaviour is nice to have and some where you like to avoid it.

Just to add anthor USE CASE, one is when your filter needs to work on an array of values as a whole and not value per value.

Lest take for example an articles module where you can publish articles and with an article associate an unlimited number of reference url.

In your form you have the elements for the article and a link "add url" which let you dynamically add urls element form. When sumited the urls appear like this:

$\_POST[links] => array('url1', 'url2', 'url3');

Lest say now that you have 2 filters:

• My\_Filter\_Url which format url and remove any 'http://' Here the recursive behaviour is pefect. • My\_Filter\_UrlBlackList which is removing url from the array if the are part of a blacklist. Then here we don't want the recursive behaviour but have the full array past to the filter.

I'm wandering if it will be possible to pass a isRecursiveFilter option to the Zend\_Form\_Element::addFilter() to switch off the behaviour on demand ? I'm not sure about this request I haven't look at the Zend\_Form code since several moths :)

 

 

Posted by Laurent Melmoux (laurent melmoux) on 2008-11-24T08:52:12.000+0000

Indeed it would be nice if Zend\_Form could support _dynamic arrays of elements_ :)

 

 

Posted by Laurent Melmoux (laurent melmoux) on 2008-11-26T08:23:22.000+0000

support dynamic arrays of elements could be usefull for multiple insert/update forms too.

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2008-11-26T08:37:57.000+0000

I'm closing this again. If you want such support, please create a proposal. It needs to specify the requirements succinctly, and layout a plan for how to keep backwards compatibility with how these elements currently work.

 

 

Posted by Jaka Jancar (jaka) on 2008-11-26T08:56:58.000+0000

Ehh...

You say you need a concrete use case. I give you one (as succinct as possible). Then you close it w/o an explanation why and tell me I should now create a proposal.

Proposal for fixing what is basically a bug. A piece of code which no-one even knows why it is there. Something that causes filters to behave inconsistently between arrays and non-arrays. And makes them behave inconsistently with validators.

Don't fix it as far as I'm concerned, I can keep patching ZF until you run into the same problem and fix it. But don't waste my time having me write stuff in vain.

 

 

Posted by Jaka Jancar (jaka) on 2008-11-26T09:00:07.000+0000

Oh, and to be clear, I "do not want such support". Laurent wants such support. I want to be able to implement it myself, using Zend\_Form as a base. I would only like Zend\_Form to work logically/consistently, so I can do so.
