### Description

Zend\_Form does not contain element for file upload. I cant figure out why. It is easy subclass of Zend\_Form\_Element\_Xhtml with $helper = 'formFile'

This was not an oversite; we are simply waiting for the Zend\_Upload component to be complete and in core before including an associated element within Zend\_Form. Once Zend\_Upload is complete, we will create the corresponding element.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
