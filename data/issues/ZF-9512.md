ZF-9512: Creating multiple connections to oracle database

### Description

The oci\_connect function returns the same connection handle for the same login credentials. You have to use oci\_new\_connect to create a second independent connection. This is - in my opinion - always the case, if you create a second connection object. A fix is to change the $connectionFuncName to 'oci\_new\_connect', if the persistent configuration value is not given.
