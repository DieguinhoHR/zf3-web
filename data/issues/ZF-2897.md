ZF-2897: Zend\_Filter $namespaces search order
----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-17T07:25:05.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-17T12:58:14.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When providing Zend\_Filter with a classBasename with the same name as a Zend\_Filter class but different namespaces Zend\_Filter becomes a higher priority in the include list.

e.g. Zend\_Filter::get('123asd', 'Int', null, array('MyWeb\_Filter'));

This would include the Zend\_Filter\_Int before it would include MyWeb\_Filter\_Int I think this should be changed to make the users filter be included first.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
