ZF-10405: Zend\_Uri::\_\_toString() doesn't handle Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2010-09-01T05:18:41.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-18T13:20:23.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Uri::\_\_toString() returns the value of getUri(), but getUri() may throw an Exception (as in Zend\_Uri\_Http). \_\_toString() methods which throw an Exception result in a fatal error. The \_\_toString() method should catch instances of Zend\_Uri\_Exception and return an empty string.

I disagree. There is no precedent anywhere in Zend Framework where an Exception is caught and an empty is returned. An empty string being returned is very difficult to debug in the case of Zend\_Uri\_Http, since the exception is thrown if the URI is not valid.

Your application should catch the exception and properly handle it, if this is a possible scenario.

On the contrary, no exception is thrown; if an exception is thrown within a \_\_toString() method, an E\_FATAL is triggered and the exception cannot be caught.

Example code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Test
    {
        public function __toString()
        {   
            throw new Exception('Argh');
        }   
    }
    
    $t = new Test();
    
    try {
        (string) $t; 
    } catch (Exception $ex) {
        echo 'caught';
    }


This results in "Fatal error: Method Test::\_\_toString() must not throw an exception," not "caught".

I found a bunch of instances within ZF that the \_\_toString() method could possibly throw an exception. Most of these instances, such as Zend\_Paginator, Zend\_Form, Zend\_Form\_Element, Zend\_Db\_Select, handled the Exception as such:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __toString()
    {
        try {
            $return = $this->render();
            return $return;
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            trigger_error($e->getMessage(), E_USER_WARNING);
        }
    
        return '';
    }


So, in addition to returning an empty string, a warning is also raised. This makes me feel better than just returning an empty string which could be very difficult to track down the cause of.

Also not, the following Zend class also have a \_\_toString() method that could possibly throw an exception and aren't handled:

- Zend\_Currency
- Zend\_Mail\_Part
- Zend\_Crypt\_Rsa\_Key
- Zend\_Uri

I will create a patch for the Zend\_Uri instance soon.

Attached patch with unit test. In this patch, I followed the precedent set by other \_\_toString() methods that can cause an Exception.

Assigning back to Shahar and changing type to patch so it can be applied.
