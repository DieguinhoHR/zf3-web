### Description

Given the following code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            require_once 'Zend/Filter/Input.php';
            
            require_once 'Zend/Validate/NotEmpty.php';
            
            
            $notEmpty = new Zend_Validate_NotEmpty();
            $notEmpty->setMessage("\"key\" may not be empty", Zend_Validate_NotEmpty::IS_EMPTY);
            
            $filter = New Zend_Filter_Input(array(), array(
                'key' => array($notEmpty)
            ), array('key' => ""));
        
            var_dump($filter->getInvalid());


I expect the following result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array
      'key' => 
        array
          'isEmpty' => string 'You must give a non-empty value for field 'key''


However, I'm getting the following result

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array
      'key' => 
        array
          'isEmpty' => string '"key" may not be empty'


which means that there is no way to actually use the NotEmpty Validator along with a custom error message, since some funny Zend\_Filter\_Input implementation preceeds my validator configuration.

uhm... what's wrong with the monospace wiki syntax?

Today I created a unit test that proves this error exists. I had previously discovered the error in a more informal way. The bad news is, that other validators are equally affected by this issue, not just the 'NotEmpty' validator.

I will try to fix this.

Added patches that resolve the issue.

I will leave the patches here for a few days for community review.

I will also assign it to Thomas hoping that he will find the time to evaluate them before I commit them.

Looks good on the first hand. Thanks for the fix. Please add the patch to ZF1 and keep the issue opened for integration into ZF2.
