This is pretty simple. Just setup apache with an ssl-certificate and make it proxy to jira. In jira you have to put the ssl host settings in the config xml and reconfigure the route in the admin interface. If you need further assistance, just ping me.

Not that simple, actually. ZF itself is behind a load-balancer, which makes SSL much more difficult -- particularly since our hosting provider controls setup of the load balancer. While I'd love to make this happen, it's not likely anytime soon.
