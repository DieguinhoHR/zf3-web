### Description

Copy operations are [supported by the S3 REST API](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/index.html?RESTObjectCOPY.html).

So, this patch adds moveObject() and copyObject() which exploits this capability.

Jon, I understand you are project lead for this component so I am assigning to you. Can you please review & apply patch if acceptable? This will then allow the SimpleCloud API to do "cheap" copy/move on S3 as well.
