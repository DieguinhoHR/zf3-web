ZF2-506: Zend\\Validator\\Db\\NoRecordExists throws PDOException when used with exclude option

### Description

When I use the Db\\NoRecordExists validator with an exclude option as array, I get an PDOException with "Invalid parameter number: mixed named and positional parameters". I tracked down the issue to the lines 314 to 317:

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/library/Zend/Validator/Db/AbstractDb.php#L314)

When I add this line

\\Zend\\Debug\\Debug::dump($select->getSqlString());

behind the $select->where() call, I get the following output, which shows that the ? is not filled with the value.

string(92) "SELECT "users"."nickname" AS "nickname" FROM "users" WHERE `nickname` = :value AND `id` != ?"

If I change the lines 314 to 317 to this single line, it works:

$select->where->notEqualTo($this->exclude['field'], $this->exclude['value']);
