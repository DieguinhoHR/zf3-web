### Description

I'm using Zend\_Translate and Zend\_Cache with memcached backend. If I activate logging like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$frontendOptions = array('lifetime' => $this->_applicationIni->cache->global->lifetime ,
         'automatic_serialization' => true,
         'automatic_cleaning_factor' => 0,    
         'write_control' => true,
         'logging'=> true,
         'logger' => $logger);
    ....
    Zend_Translate::setCache($cache);

Then I get a lot of messages like {quote}Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached::save() : tags are unsupported by the Memcached backend{quote}

This is because the memcached adapter does not support tags, and Zend\_Translate uses tags. Is it possible to make these tags optional so I can disable the use of tags in Zend\_Translate?

Closing as won't fix.

According to the manual Zend\_Cache must be used with tags to allow deletion of relevant cache entries (not the complete cache). The manual does not note that this works only with special frontends/backends.

Actually there is no way to change Zend\_Translate other than integrating a BC by disallowing cache handling.
