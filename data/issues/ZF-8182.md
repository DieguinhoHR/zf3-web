### Description

Method send() calls isExists() that calls getQueues() that in turn calls \_sendCommand() that opens new socket each time it's called. This is real performance killer and even leads to denial of service due to reaching sockets limit on heavy writes.

I would suggest either lazy opening single socket and holding it around, or completely remove isExists() call from send() because it's useless anyway - in Memcacheq, queues are created on-the-fly, so they always "exist".
