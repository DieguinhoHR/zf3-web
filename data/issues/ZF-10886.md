ZF-10886: parse error using zf.sh

### Description

I really wasn't sure if this is the place to address this but I didn't know where else to send this and couldn't find anything online about the problem.

I have ZF installed on my Mac running OS 10.4.11. I've adjusted my php.ini include\_path to point to all necessary folders.

Anyways, when I go to run zf.sh in the terminal all I get is the following error message:

Parse error: parse error, expecting `T_OLD_FUNCTION' or`T\_FUNCTION' or `T_VAR' or`'}'' in /Applications/MAMP/bin/zend/zf.php on line 38

Is this something to do with my setup or is this a bug?

Again, sorry if this is not the place to address this issue.

Paul

Can you please check your PHP version! I bet you're running a PHP version prior to PHP 5. Here the link to the requirements of ZF: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/requirements.introduction.html)

Please write a short comment, if this problem occured due to missing requirements.

(Note that the MAMP php version is not taken as PHP CLI by default. Find out with php -v on your terminal.)

I am using MAMP and the settings show that I am using PHP 5.3.3; however, in the terminal it shows php version 4.4.9.

So, I guess we have the answer.

Indeed! ;)

I'll close this issue.
