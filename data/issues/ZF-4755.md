ZF-4755: Implement Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar method to insert a new calendar
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-10-30T16:10:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:39.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Implement Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar::insertListEntry, or perhaps Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar::insertCalendar, so people can create new calendars.

For comparison, we have Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar::insertEvent to create new events from Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventEntry objects. However, if we followed this naming scheme, we'd have Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar::insertList, which makes no sense.
