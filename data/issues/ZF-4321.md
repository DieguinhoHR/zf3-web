### Description

Paginating Zend\_Search\_Lucene results is something that's in fact already supported through the Iterator (or perhaps even the Array) adapter. However, it might be worth investigating if a specialized Lucene adapter would provide some benefit when paginating search results. For example, result caching would be a welcome feature. Alexander's email about the workings of ZSL and the Zym\_Search\_Lucene implementation (which supports caching) could be used as reference.

After a (short ; ) discussion with Alexander the decision has been made to look at providing ZSL with a caching mechanism. Therefor a specialized adapter would be redundant. Instead, a section in the manual should be added on how to efficiently paginate search results.

The addition of an internal Zend\_Search\_Lucene caching mechanism appears to make any search result caching documentation for Zend\_Paginator unnecessary.

I should add that when such a feature is released, this issue can be reexamined in light of any new information.
