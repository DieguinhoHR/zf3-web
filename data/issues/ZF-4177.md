### Description

I have some code built with early version of Paginator when it was still in 1.6RC It stop working after recent upgrade, it can't handle a select query with a DISTINCT clause

Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception' with message 'Mysqli prepare error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\*) AS zend\_paginator\_row\_count FROM `foo` AS `a` WHERE (active = 1)' at line 1' in Zend/Db/Statement/Mysqli.php:84

Could you post the code you used for the select query?

Any query with distinct clause should do. I can replicate it with this code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $select = $db->select()->distinct()->from('foo');
            $adapter = new Zend_Paginator_Adapter_DbSelect($select);
            $paginator = new Zend_Paginator($adapter);
            $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(20);


Last line trigger the same exception.

Is that the actual query you were using at that time? I can see where it fails with that sample query.... Could you explain why you would want to execute a SELECT DISTINCT _? A possible solution for this would be to check wether or not the columns() are \* in case of a distinct query. In that case, it should just COUNT(_) instead of COUNT(DISTINCT \*).

It was part of a more complex query where I was reading columns from only one table but other were used for filtering. This was creating duplicate entries so I used distinct. My code changed since then and I don't need distinct clause at the moment, but it was still in the code and I noticed it stopped working after update.

The query would like this: select a.\* from foo a left join bar b on a.id = b.foo\_id where bar\_id IN(1,2,3,4,5)

Because each entity in foo can have more then one entry in bar some rows will appear more then once.
