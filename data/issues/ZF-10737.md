### Description

The file "Zend/Tool/Project/Context/Zf/HtaccessFile.php" contains following rules.

RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -s [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -l [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -d RewriteRule ^._$ - [NC,L] RewriteRule ^._$ index.php [NC,L]

This rules can be optimized by the following change

RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -s [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -l [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_FILENAME} -d RewriteRule ^ - [NC,L] RewriteRule ^ index.php [NC,L]

The only change is, that the RewriteRule not looks like: RewriteRule ^ This means, match every pattern that starts. Witch is the same as ^.\*$. The parsing of the regex rule might be some millisecond or nanosecond faster then the old method.
