### Description

When using ZendPlatform as the backend for Zend\_Cache, the tagging of records is not working as expected. Each unique tag will reference the first record that was tagged with it, only. This seems due to the fact that output\_cache\_put() does _not_ overwrite an existing record with the same key.

Preceding the call to output\_cache\_put() with a call to output\_cache\_remove\_key() seems to solve the issue:
