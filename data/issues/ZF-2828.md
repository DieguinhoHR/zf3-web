### Description

I'm just going to post a print\_r of my two arrays. First is the one used to build a simple form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [method] => post
        [elements] => Array
            (
                [100_1] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => multicheckbox
                        [1] => Array
                            (
                                [multioptions] => Array
                                    (
                                        [100_1_1] => Agriculture
                                        [100_1_2] => Automotive
                                        [100_1_12] => Chemical
                                        [100_1_13] => Communications
                                    )
    
                                [required] => 1
                                [label] => Select the industry or industries that you work in
                            )
    
                    )
                [Submit] => submit
            )
    
    )


The second is the post data with all 4 fields checked:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [100_1] => Array
            (
                [0] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 100_1_1
                    )
    
                [1] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 100_1_2
                    )
    
                [2] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 100_1_12
                    )
    
                [3] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => 100_1_13
                    )
    
            )
        [Submit] => Submit
    )


Populating the form with the post data will not refill the check boxes.

This is for the latest HEAD: 8634

I need: \* Minimum code needed to reproduce (use an array from a form submission, if need be) \* Expected outcome \* Actual outcome

The description you gave does not give me nearly enough to go on.

Additionally, please advise as to what version of ZF you are using \* Preview Release \* RC1 \* Current trunk (and whether you had updated just prior to submitting the report)

Downgrading issue and removing priority until submission can be clarified.

I've added a test for this in trunk and the 1.5 release branch, but this was resolved previously with fixes for ZF-2830.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.
