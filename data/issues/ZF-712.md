ZF-712: Gdata exception handling is confusing
---------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-04T08:36:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:38.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.7.0 (18/Jan/07)

### Description

Zend\_Gdata throws Zend\_Gdata\_Exception sometimes, and Zend\_Http\_Client\_Exception (or its subclasses) other times. This is confusing. Please make Zend\_Gdata throw only Zend\_Gdata\_Exception or subclasses.

Also there is only one Zend\_Gdata\_Exception, but the nature of the exceptions take multiple forms. Please make more exception subclasses to make the distinction more clear.

Created the following exceptions:

- Zend\_Gdata\_AuthException: the user's credentials were not accepted.
- Zend\_Gdata\_BadMethodCallException: a method was called for a service that does not accept it (e.g. post() for CodeSearch).
- Zend\_Gdata\_HttpException: Http-related issues, or re-thrown Zend\_Http\_Client\_Exception.
- Zend\_Gdata\_InvalidArgumentException: the application tried to set a parameter to an invalid value (e.g. a calendar projection value of "banana").

The new exceptions are all subclasses of Zend\_Gdata\_Exception.

The only backward-compatibility break is that Zend\_Http\_Client\_Exception was thrown before in certain cases, and now it is Zend\_Gdata\_HttpException.
