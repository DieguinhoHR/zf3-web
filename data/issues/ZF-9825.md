### Description

The manual's comments is gradually filling up with irrelevant comments.

If these comments are going to be useful, then all of the comments should be relevant to the component that it refers to in the manual.

<http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/> for example has not 1 relevant comment. It is simply a bunch of people saying well done, or complaining about the quality of the documentation, or asking for a downloadable version.

The complaints at best should be raised as documentation issues, and made specific to the points that people feel are poorly documented.

The other comments such as the well dones, and requests for downloadable versions etc. should be saved for the mailing list, IRC, or some other discussion forum.
