ZF-12076: Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::\_loadPluginResource() should not register plugin resource by itself

### Description

Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::\_loadPluginResource() currently do more then it is expected from method named "load" since it is not just load and return plugin resource, but also registers it into $\_pluginResources member variable. This behavior makes loading plugin resources without registering them impossible.

Correct behavior for this method would be simple loading of requested plugin resource.

While the name might be misleading, the point of loading plugin resources is also to register them so they are available.
