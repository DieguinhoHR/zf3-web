ZF-2630: addMultipleOption(s) squashes value
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-02-12T17:19:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-31T16:04:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Tested on both 1.5.0PR and latest from svn.

In Multi.php function addMultiOption line 103: the $value is being overwritten by the translated or passed through value of $option. $value is never utilized unless there is no translator in use, so this occurs only when a translator is specified.

If the line is changed to $option = $translator->translate($option); Then the dropdowns are populated correctly. If this causes something to be incorrect with line 106, I don't know.

Before I work on this, I need to verify that I understand the issue correctly. Please provide the following:

- Minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue
- Expected outcome
- Actual outcome

If you have a patch that fixes the issue, that will also be helpful.

As it stands right now, I'm not entirely sure what issue it is you're experiencing -- it may be intended behaviour, but I cannot tell until I have the above.

Code to reproduce: $form = new Zend\_Form; $select = $form->addElement(new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select('test')); $form->test->addMultiOption('foo','bar'); $translate = new Zend\_Translate('array',array('foo' => 'FOO'); $form->setDefaultTranslator($translate); $this->view->testForm = $form;

Expected Outcome: FOO

Actual Outcome: FOO

Format patch to avoid wrapping.

Fixed in trunk; please test.

The original overwriting of the value is fixed, however I've noticed something now occurring. The value and the label are being switched.

Given the following code: $form = new Zend\_Form; $select = $form->addElement(new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select('test')); $form->test->addMultiOption('foo','bar'); $translate = new Zend\_Translate('array',array('foo' => 'FOO','bar' => 'BAR')); $form->setDefaultTranslator($translate); $this->view->createForm = $form;

I would expect: FOO

However the actual outcome: BAR

Unless I'm mistaken the addMultipleOption args are $option,$value rather than the reverse.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.
