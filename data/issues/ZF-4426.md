### Description

According to the code of Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::addTranslation() if you pass it a directory, it does a recursive seek through the directory tree from the point given searching for files it can use as translation sources.

Unfortunately, it also picks up subdirs beginning with . (period / full stop) and traverses through them. Consequence of this is that it goes through things like Subversion (.svn) directories and adds OLD copies of files.

I couldn't figure out why when I had deleted some TMX tagnames they still kept getting used. The previous version was in the svn archive folder!!! which translate\_adaptor happily saw as being valid.

I understand that it may be an intended effect to give the root of a language file hierarchy, but perhaps consideration can be given to _excluding_ otherwise normally hidden directories from the directory span. (perhaps passing a flag that defaults to NOT traversing hidden directories)

Now all I got to do is figure out how to unravel it :-}

Simply use the 'ignore' option already available since several weeks in trunk. Per default it ignores files and directories beginning with '.'
