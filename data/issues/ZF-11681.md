### Description

Other regional languages from the British Isles already exist:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Welsh   cy
    Manx    gv
    Cornish  kw


But not Scottish Gaelic which is a lot more widely spoken than Manx and Cornish.

Closing as won't fix.

Please contact the CLDR project (unicode.org/cldr) for problems or missing informations on their library because even the actual CLDR release 2.01 does not include the language "gd".
