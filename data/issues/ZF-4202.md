ZF-4202: Cannot view FirePHP logs in FireBug from AJAX requests
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-05T07:46:46.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-08T11:15:46.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

I have used FirePHP for debugging AJAX Requests with the fb() function. With change to Version 1.6.0 I have removed all fb() function calls and use Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Firebug. But when the AJAX call finishes, I do not see any Log from FirePHP. Does it depend on different behaviour in the Front Controller between normal requests and AJAX requests? I use to send the result as JSON with Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Json.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->getHelper('Json')->sendJson($foo);


In FireBug I get the following error on the "Server" tab: "X-FirePHP-Data" response header not found in request response!

_Cause:_ See ZF-4134.

_Workaround:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $json = $this->getHelper('Json');
    $json->suppressExit = true;
    $json->sendJson($foo);
    Zend_Wildfire_Channel_HttpHeaders::getInstance()->flush();
    $json->getResponse()->sendResponse();
    exit;

It should work the same for AJAX and other requests.

Can you send me your bootstrap file for the ajax requests?

You may need to add ob\_start() before you print your AJAX response so the headers will still get set at the end of the request.

Setting "ob\_start()" does not change anything. Here is my Bootstrap file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    //error_reporting(E_ALL|E_STRICT);
    
    /**
     * classes.php sets the includepath for this application and loads Framework related classes
     *
     */
    include 'classes.php';
    
    // How to switch layout for registration? quite simple :-)
    $layout = Zend_Layout::startMvc(array(
        'layoutPath' => '../application/layouts/scripts',
        'layout' => 'standard',
        'mvcSuccessfulActionOnly' => false,
    ));
    $view = $layout->getView();
    $view->setEncoding('utf-8');
    $view->doctype('HTML4_STRICT');
    
    $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $frontController->throwExceptions(false);
    $frontController->addModuleDirectory('../application/modules');
    $frontController->registerPlugin(new PluginLoader());
    
    $frontController->dispatch();

If you are using the above bootstrap then it will not work as the Firebug log writer is not initialized.

I have tested it with the JSON Helper and it is working fine as long as you have the writer initialized.

I forgot to post my LoggingPlugin which creates the different Logwriter. Look at the following code. This Plugin gets loaded on every request from the PluginLoader Plugin

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class LoggingPlugin extends Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract
    {
        public function routeShutdown(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
        {
            $config = Zend_Registry::get('Zend_Config');
            $logger = new Zend_Log();
    
            // read config options for Log Writers
            foreach ($config['logging']['writer'] as $writer)
            {
                if((bool)$writer['active'] == true)
                {
                    switch ($writer['type'])
                    {
                        // different file writers are possible
                        case 'file':
                            {
                                $fileWriter = new Zend_Log_Writer_Stream($writer['logpath'].$writer['logfile'], 'a+');
                                $fileWriter->addFilter(new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority((int)$writer['level']));
                                $logger->addWriter($fileWriter);
    
                                break;
                            }
                        case 'firebug':
                            {
                                require_once 'Zend/Log/Writer/Firebug.php';
                                    
                                $firebugWriter = new Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug();
                                $firebugWriter->addFilter(new Zend_Log_Filter_Priority((int)$writer['level'])); // Don't know if this works
    
                                // use an own instance of Zend_Log for FirePHP because of different debugging
                                $firebugLogger = new Zend_Log($firebugWriter);
                                Zend_Registry::set('FirePHP', $firebugLogger);
    
                                break;
                            }
                    }
                }
            }
    
            Zend_Registry::set('Zend_Log', $logger);
        }
    }

I have tested it with a plugin like your setup and it is working. I think the only way for me to troubleshoot this for you is with a stripped down demo app.

The Zend\_Log\_Filter\_Priority should work as well.

I think your problem is related to: ZF-4134

I was using

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->view->json('Sample Json Data');


in my action controller but I guess that is not the same thing.

 

 

Posted by Christoph Dorn (cadorn) on 2008-09-08T11:03:33.000+0000

As a workaround you can do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->getHelper('Json')->suppressExit = true;
    $this->getHelper('Json')->sendJson($foo);
    Zend_Wildfire_Channel_HttpHeaders::getInstance()->flush();
    $this->getHelper('Json')->getResponse()->sendResponse();

Sorry, forgot "exit" at the end.

Duplicate of ZF-4134.
