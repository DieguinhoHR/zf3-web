### Description

The manual suggests adding a plugin loader cache as one means to improve performance. When I tried this on a Windows system where the first few lines in pluginLoaderCache.php used UNC paths, the site failed to load after the cache was created until I escaped all backslash characters in the file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    include_once '\\server\path\file.php';


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    include_once '\\\\server\\path\\file.php';
