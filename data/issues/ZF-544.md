### Description

Copy of a related email:

Hi all,

I've been trying to setup a simple web service using the REST server. The basic premise is that I have a single table holding a collection of notes. Each note row has id, user, tag and text fields. The idea of the webservice was to allow an API for the client to retrieve notes using a combination of field values (on the server class Zend\_Rest\_Server handles from the parameters would be used to build a WHERE string).

Because its so simple, and can be easily done with a single class method, I created the following allowed routes (using parameters rather than a query string).

1. <http://www.example.com/service/note/user/XXX> (Get notes by user id)
2. <http://www.example.com/service/note/tag/XXX> (Get notes by tag)
3. [http://example.com/service/note/…](http://www.example.com/service/note/user/XXX/tag/XXX) (get notes by tag, restricted to user id)
4. <http://www.example.com/service/note/id/XXX> (Get a single note by id)

No consideration given to limiting access. Params set when calling Zend\_Rest\_Server::handle().

I then implemented a simple handler method on the class passed to Zend\_Rest\_Server::setClass() which would accept a variable number of parameters. This is prevented however by;

[line 113, Zend/Rest/Server.php] if (sizeof($calling\_args) < sizeof($func\_args)) { throw new Zend\_Rest\_Server\_Exception('Invalid Method Call to ' .$method. '. Requires ' .sizeof($func\_args). ', ' .sizeof($calling\_args). ' given.', 400); }

Any plans to allow variable parameter counts in the future? Without that facility, it means adding a chunk of logic in the ServiceController::noteAction() method to determine the correct parameter count and order, and then adding multiple public methods on the handler class. Additionally, parameters on the handler class method _must_ be very specific with the parameter variable name being the key string on any request parameter prefixed with $, i.e. if the array passed to Zend\_Rest\_Server::handle() contains the param array('tag'=>'ajax'), the handler method must call it's parameter $tag (anything else fails).

All this seems fairly confusing unless you dig into the code to figure out the quirks. Otherwise I really like this component, I look forward to using it regardless :).

Regards, Pádraic

Assigning to Davey.

This isn't really feasible. However, I may look into it further just for fun, but for now, I don't think the restriction is too hard.

You can of course, write a simple wrapper class, where each method accepts specific args, or make the function accept the max number of args coming in, and pass in a $request array to the handle() method which defines the empty ones as null or false or some such :)

Another possiblity is to override the rest server to allow variable numbers of arguments.

Also, if there are a finite number of possible arguments, consider declaring and documenting your method differently:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Note handler
     *
     * @param string|int $user
     * @param string|int $tag
     * @param int $id
     * @return array|string
    public function note($user = null, $tag = null, $id = null)
    {
    }


Notice the use of the | operator in the docblock. By setting default values for each argument, you make them optional, effectively allowing between 0 and 3 arguments; by setting multiple types for each argument in the docblock, you allow different types of arguments. With some creative docblock/optional argument pairing, you can probably achieve what you need to accomplish.

The way I did it was simply to have a few public methods for each set of args proxy to the same private method which handled the querying. It wasn't difficult to set up, so once I got over the paramater restrictions it was plain sailing from there.

I'll keep the other suggestions on tap for the future. Thanks!
