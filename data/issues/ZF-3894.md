### Description

There seems to be a problem with joins generated by Zend\_Db\_Select.

According to my little reserach query is contructed in \_renderFrom it using all tables from $this->\_parts[self::FROM], with first table being the table which we're selecting "from" and others are being joined. However this array is ordered diffrently (maybe a problem in \_join() ?).

I fixed this by adding a code to \_renderFrom which searches for "main" table (joinCondition is empty) and moves it in front of array (yes, I realize this solution is really hacky). Something like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    @@ -897,6 +897,19 @@
                 $this->_parts[self::FROM] = $this->_getDummyTable();
             }
    
    +       // arrange array so first table is first in array. Note this changes state of class
    +       // which is not good. We're also not fixing problem but consequence.
    +       $first = reset($this->_parts[self::FROM]);
    +       if($first["joinCondition"]) {
    +               foreach($this->_parts[self::FROM] as $key => $part) {
    +                       if($part["joinCondition"]) continue;
    +
    +                       unset($this->_parts[self::FROM][$key]);
    +                       $this->_parts[self::FROM] = array_merge(array($key=>$part), $this->_parts[self::FROM]);
    +                       break;
    +               }
    +       }
    +
             $from = array();
    
             foreach ($this->_parts[self::FROM] as $correlationName => $table) {
    


this is code snippet demonstrating this behaviour (it's ripped from my project, so it's not really possible to run it by itself - you need so set up adapter and such).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Model_Runs extends Zend_Db_Table
        protected $_name = "runs";
        protected $_sequence = true;
        protected $_primary = array('id');
    
        public function blah()
        {
             $select = $this->select();
             $select->join('survey_runs', 'survey_runs.id_run = runs.id', array());
             echo $select->__toString(); die();
        }
    }


result: SELECT "runs".\* FROM "survey\_runs" INNER JOIN "runs"

expected result: SELECT "runs".\* FROM "runs" INNER JOIN "survey\_runs" ON survey\_runs.id\_run = runs.id

I ran into the same problem.

A workaround I found was to do

 
    <pre class="highlight">$select = $this->select();
    $select->__toString();
    $select->join('survey_runs', 'survey_runs.id_run = runs.id', array());


My guess is that when calling \_\_toString it seems that the table name is added to $this->\_parts[self::FROM] which means that it is now first in the array and everything works.

From Christian Grafe

I'd really like to see this bug fixed. If its any help, I think I might have located the cause for this issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // If no fields are specified we assume all fields from primary table
    if (!count($fields)) {
         $this->from($primary, self::SQL_WILDCARD, $schema);
         $fields = $this->getPart(Zend_Db_Table_Select::COLUMNS);
    }


These lines from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select::assemble() will add the primary table to our query, only if we have _not_ joined another table. I would think that for a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select query we always want all fields from the primary table. So, imho the above call to $this->from() should be made in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select::\_\_construct(), which fixes the problem for me.

This has been fixed with the solution in ZF-2546, use $table->select(true) to retrieve a select object with the from part pre-loaded.
