ZF-4894: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2 does not work with iSeries (AS/400)

### Description

The reason is the sql statement in the describeTable() method. If you change it to our version, it works. We have created a modified version of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2 called Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2iseries, that overloads this method, but I think, that some kind of option in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Db2 will be better. We are using ZF 1.5.3 now, so it is possible, that it will be necessary to adapt the code for 1.7.x

It seems, that this will not work for z/OS version of DB2, only for AS400

This is our sql code:

 
        $sql = "SELECT DISTINCT c.table_schema, c.table_name, c.column_name, c.ordinal_position,
              c.data_type, c.column_default, c.is_nullable, c.length, c.numeric_scale,
              c.is_identity, tc.type AS tabconsttype, k.colseq
            FROM qsys2.syscolumns c
              LEFT JOIN (qsys2.syskeys k JOIN qsys2.syscst tc
                ON (k.index_schema = tc.table_schema
                  AND k.index_name = tc.table_name
                  AND tc.type = 'PRIMARY KEY'))
              ON (c.table_schema = k.index_schema
                AND c.table_name = k.index_name
                AND c.column_name = k.column_name)
              WHERE "
            . $this->quoteInto('UPPER(c.table_name) = UPPER(?)', $tableName);
        if ($schemaName) {
            $sql .= $this->quoteInto(' AND UPPER(c.table_schema) = UPPER(?)', $schemaName);
        }
        $sql .= " ORDER BY c.ordinal_position";

Can't you close this with fix for 1.7.0, Ralph?

Satoru, the changes you applied broke unit tests on i5 for OS400 on my v5r4. I am gonna update, then can you test on your i5?

Will keep you posted.

I confirm this issue would not be shown in following test code. This seems to be resolved in 1.7.3 .

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Db2Controller extends Zend_Controller_Action {
        protected $_db;
        public function init() {
            $this->_db = Zend_Db::factory('Db2',
                array(
                'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                'username' => 'YOUR USER',
                'password' => 'YOUR PASS',
                'dbname'   => 'DSPRDBDIRE VALUE')
            );
            $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender(TRUE);
        }
    
        public function indexAction() {
            $this->_db->getConnection();
            $sql = 'SELECT * FROM ZTESTL.ZTESTF WHERE COLA = ?';
            $result = $this->_db->fetchAll($sql, 'T001');
            var_dump($result);
            $this->_db->closeConnection();
        }
    }
