### Description

I recently created new issues for ZF2. I must be overlooking something, but I can't find a way to create an issue for ZF2 anymore. Sorry for the inconvenience and please fix the bug so we can create issues for ZF2 again.

The issue: In the manual there is a reference to the [BaseUrl Helper](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.view.helpers.html#baseurl-helper), but this view helper does not exist in ZF2.

On the same page in the section [Navigation setup used in examples](http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.view.helpers.html#navigation-setup-used-in-examples) there is a reference to a method called _getHelper()_. This method also does not exist in ZF2.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Store the container in the proxy helper:
    $view->getHelper('navigation')->setContainer($container);
