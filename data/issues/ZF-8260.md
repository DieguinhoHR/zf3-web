ZF-8260: Interplay between Zend\_Ldap and Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap causes issues with anonymous bind (or unbound) ldap connections.

### Description

When using Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap->setLdap() the adapter automatically loads the options as set for the given Zend\_Ldap argument. However, this also returns username which may not have been explicitly set (and has thus defaulted to NULL), which then gets converted to the empty string ''. When the adapter then tries to authenticate, it passes a new options object with an empty string username, which Zend\_Ldap interprets as a real username.

There are a few problems here: - Zend\_Ldap->bind() checks whether $username === null, to my knowledge it would be more sane to replace this with empty($username), because an empty username (in whatever way specified) will always result in errors somewhere down the road, - Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap converts options to string (IIRC because it does trim() on them) even when not applicable, - Zend\_Ldap->getOptions() returns all implicit options too.

Can you please provide some sample use-case for what you want to do?

I currently cannot understand which options you would want the auth-adapter to retain when setting an explicit LDAP adapter if there are conflicting options in the auth-adapter and in the LDAP adapter respectively.

Here's some code to illustrate the issue:

$opts = Zend\_Registry::get('config')->ldap; $ldap = new Zend\_Ldap($opts); $adapter = new Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap(); $adapter->setLdap($ldap) ->setIdentity($user) ->setCredential($password);

This sets up Zend\_Ldap (without username / password) and sets up an auth adapter. The auth adapter meanwhile (in setLdap()) has asked options from Zend\_Ldap, and stored them internally. As soon as \_prepareOptions() is being called in the auth adapter, it will call setOptions on Zend\_Ldap with the just requested options.

This results in the following: - Zend\_Ldap is created, no username or password is specified (both are NULL internally) - Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap queries for the options on setLdap(), this now contains an array with NULL for both username and password. - Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap calls Zend\_Ldap->setOptions() with NULL for username and password, and Zend\_Ldap calls trim() on them, causing them to be converted to string values '' (happens in Zend\_Ldap->setOptions(), not in the auth adapter as I said in the report). Zend\_Ldap tries to bind, sees username !== null, tries to figure out what to make from it, will result in an error because it can't figure out what to make from the empty string.

So point 2 of the issue is invalid, but can be replaced by the fact that Zend\_Ldap->setOptions() calls trim on values that might not be strings.

I hope this is clear enough, else I can provide more information if needed.

Do you have the possibility to check out the most recent version from the SVN trunk? I just changed the detection of anonymous binds in Zend\_Ldap - that might solve your problem already. If not please leave a short notice here and I'll have a look into this once more.

Seems to work in trunk indeed, thanks for fixing.
