### Description

I was codding component using a Zend\_Http\_Client and stumbled across an issue with a URL containing the carret symbol (^)

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Uri\_Exception' with message 'Invalid URI supplied' in /server/var/zend\_1.6.0/Zend/Uri/Http.php:136 Stack trace:

0 /server/var/zend\_1.6.0/Zend/Uri.php(123): Zend\_Uri\_Http->\_\_construct('http', 'snip')
===========================================================================================

1 /server/var/zend\_1.6.0/Zend/Http/Client.php(251): Zend\_Uri::factory('snip')
===============================================================================

the URI Used looks something like this and is valid but zend chockes on it

[http://example.com/LoginAction.do?userid=^u](http://example.com/LoginAction.do?userid=%5Eu)

i tested in 1.6.0 and 1.5.3 and both have same issue

- - - - - -

EDIT: heres a quick patch i made and use successfully
-----------------------------------------------------

patch line 122 of Zend\\Uri\\Http.php with following

-- $this->\_regex['uric'] = '(?:' . $this->\_regex['reserved'] . '|' . $this->\_regex['unreserved'] . '|' ++ $this->\_regex['uric'] = '(?:' . $this->\_regex['reserved'] . '|' . $this->\_regex['unreserved'] . '|\\^|'

the above needs further testing and needs to pass zend unit tests but it did the job for me

According to the URI RFC (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>) the carrot (^) symbol is not a legitimate character in the query string. So Zend\_Uri is doing the right thing by not accepting it, and you should encode it before passing it in.

We might need to consider a non-strict mode for Zend\_Uri where "unwise" characters are accepted (see section 2.4.3 in RFC 2396).

Support for this is now implemented, see ZF-4649 for details.

It does require that you set a global configuration option before using Zend\_Uri or Zend\_Http\_Client:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Normally, this would return false:
    $valid = Zend_Uri::check('<a href="http://example.com/?q=this%7Cthat">http://example.com/?q=this|that</a>'); // Contains '|' symbol
    
    // However, you can allow "unwise" characters
    Zend_Uri::setConfig(array('allow_unwise' => true));
    $valid = Zend_Uri::check('<a href="http://example.com/?q=this%7Cthat">http://example.com/?q=this|that</a>'); // will return 'true'
    
    // Reset the 'allow_unwise' value to the default FALSE
    Zend_Uri::setConfig(array('allow_unwise' => false));
