Patch to prefix controllers created within modules with Module\_

I don't know if there is a better place to format (ucfirst()) the module name? (Related to fix for ZF-6853)

I just applied this patch to the 1.9.3 code and it works just fine. I hope to see this included in the trunk soon.

runnign 1.11.0

zf create module blog

creates application/modules/blog per the patch, but should it also create tests/application/modules/blog?

In the case of (see ZF-7121) zf create module admin zf create controller index index-action-included[=1] admin

tests/application/controllers/IndexControllerTest.php is overwritten, I would assume that it should create a tests/application/modules/admin/controllers/IndexControllerTest.php instead.
