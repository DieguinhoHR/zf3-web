### Description

There is a problem with zend form and subforms, the subform markup is made of

 < fieldset>......... , this causes problems when we have many subforms in a form , for example i had 7 of them that i wanted to show hide with JS, and i ended up with lots of empty spaces in the form that i could not correct any way with css. Maybe the empty element should not be created when we add subform to our main form ?

Need some reproduce code before I can proceed.

Reproduce code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $subForm = new Zend_Form_SubForm(array(
        'elements' => array(
            'foo' => 'text', 
            'bar' => 'text',
        ),  
    )); 
    $form = new Zend_Form(); 
    $form->addSubForm($subForm, 'foobar')
         ->setView(new Zend_View); 
    echo $form;

Test added to ensure that subform

 has no-break space. While we understand the issues presented, we do not plan to support the request as there are existing options to address it.

- The user can remove the DtDdWrapper decorator and instead use the HtmlTag wrapper to add a sole tag.
- CSS selectors can be used effectively to change the display settings
- JS libraries can be used to locate and decorate the appropriate DOM elements
