ZF-2981: Fieldset having method and action of form added to it
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-27T06:14:04.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-05-05T11:44:43.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.2 (15/May/08)

### Description

Using the following code to add a form:

//Setup the form. $form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->setAction($actionUrl) ->setMethod('post') ->setAttrib('id','addCompany') ->setLegend($title) ->addDecorator(new Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Fieldset()) //This puts our form in a fieldset. ->setView($this->view) ->addElement('hash', 'no\_csrf\_foo', array('salt' => 'unique', 'timeout' => 300));

It adds a method and form to the surrounding fieldset. This is obviously not correct and causes it to fail validation.

Apologies if my use of addDecorator is incorrect but it would seem that there should never be these attributes on a fieldset tag.

Thanks Tom
