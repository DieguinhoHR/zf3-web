[http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/InfoCard/Auth/Adapter.php)

... It's been there pretty much since the component was functional :)

Reopening the issue, until the components are promoted to core (available in the trunk for next release).

Looks like we just need a couple of things to get this to be acceptable for core:

- Documentation
- Passing unit tests with at least 80% code coverage

Did I miss anything?

I get a fatal error on running the tests:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'PHPUnit/Framework/TestSuite.php' (include_path='.;C:\wamp\php\PEAR

You might try using the TestHelper.php script in incubator/tests and/or PATH\_SEPARATOR instead of colons.

This was fixed and the test suite should run just fine now.

Reopening pending code, tests, and docs acceptance to core for release (i.e., moved to trunk).

Shouldn't the Zend\_Auth adapter be named Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_InfoCard like the others? Matthew informs me that the InfoCard component will have a separate release package, much like that for Zend\_Gdata, but the Zend\_Auth adapter is not to be included in this package.

Committed the changes for the Class name change (renamed Zend\_InfoCard\_Auth\_Adapter to Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_InfoCard and corrected, docs. etc

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-01-15T13:14:37.000+0000

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Infocard is now in core on trunk. All pending issues are tracked elsewhere.
