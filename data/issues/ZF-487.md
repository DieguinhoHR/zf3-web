ZF-487: [Coding Standard] TRUE, FALSE, NULL
-------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Filter and Zend\_Filter\_Input use TRUE, FALSE, and NULL instead of true, false, and null. It appears that the de facto standard in all other classes is lowercase for these.

It's not only standard, it's faster than UPPERCASE.

You can blame me for that. I always uppercase constants.

Is using lowercase really the standard we're going to be using? If so, this is a trivial change.

I don't know if it's the standard (last time I checked, there was nothing on it in the spec), but the vast majority of the other classes use lowercase, so it appears that that is the natural (i.e., de facto) standard. I've filed issues for the maybe 2 or 3 other classes that don't.
