### Description

_Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_File, Line 126 and 129_

The view helper "$view->formFile()" is typed and not used dynamic from the elements helper ($element->helper). So it's not possible to override / extend the formFile view helper.

(Using 1.11.0dev, source from [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend))

+Line 126:+ $markup[] = $view->formFile($name, $htmlAttribs);

+Line 129:+ $markup[] = $view->formFile($name, $attribs);

I made a patch but didn't find a way to upload it here.

_Index: library/Zend/Form/Decorator/File.php_
=============================================

_library/Zend/Form/Decorator/File.php (revision 23012)_

+ Line 120: $helper = $element->helper;

- Line 126: $markup[] = $view->formFile($name, $htmlAttribs); + Line 126: $markup[] = $view->$helper($name, $htmlAttribs);

- Line 129: $markup[] = $view->formFile($name, $attribs); + Line 129: $markup[] = $view->$helper($name, $attribs);

============================================ END

Best regards, Alex
