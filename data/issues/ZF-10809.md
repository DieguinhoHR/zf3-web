### Description

You seem to be creating an instance of Zend\_Cache\_Core on line 161 and 162 and assigning it to the optiontemplates array. This is completely unneccessary because all instances of Zend\_Cache should be within the \_caches array (I don't believe the \_optionTemplates array was meant to hold instances of Zend\_Cache).

This lines (161 and 162) only to create instance of Zend\_Cache\_Core to use of Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Static. See [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.cache.backends.html#zend.cache.backends.static)
