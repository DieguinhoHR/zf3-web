ZF-4143: Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_AutoCompleteScriptaculous produces empty list item when $data is empty

### Description

if $data passed to Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_AutoCompleteScriptaculous::prepareAutoCompletion() is empty, ie, empty string or empty array, it will return "

- 

" as the result.

The problem is that the autocomplete control will treat the empty "

" as an actual option. Not only it is ugly but when the user presses enter the value in the text input will be wiped out, which is very irritating. The fix would be very simple, check if $data is empty, if so return nothing or an empty "

" pair.
