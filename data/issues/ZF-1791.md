ZF-1791: Zend\_log attributes should be protected instead of private
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-07-30T11:03:13.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:28:47.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.2 (25/Sep/07)

### Description

I was able to extend several other Zend Framework classes as they provide their attributes as "protected" members.

For Zend\_Log the attributes are provided as "private" and are not accessible in child classes. Here are the attributes concerned

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_priorities = array();
    protected $_writers = array();
    protected $_filters = array();
    protected $_extras = array();


I had to manually edit the Zend Code which is not acceptable of course ;-) It would break my app if I upgrade to a next ZF release without manually patching the changes.

I set the type to "Bug" as I consider it being a design bug. Thanks for fixing it!
