ZF-10003: Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl and elementFormDefault

### Description

There's no way to set elementFormDefault currently in Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl. I have fixed this issue on my server by editing Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl to include elementFormDefault as hard coded attribute in function addSchemaTypeSection() as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_schema->setAttribute('elementFormDefault', 'qualified');


For a real fix on this one would of course need to parametrize this.

This issue might be related to: [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7049>]
