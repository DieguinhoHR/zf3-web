ZF-3032: when creating a feed with Zend\_Builder channel pubDate could be smatter

### Description

Imagine I create a feed (RSS) with Zend\_Builder from an array, I don't have to set 'lastUpdate' date as it isn't mandatory. Now if I set a 'lastUpdate' on each entry the main pubDate (=lastUpdate) must be the max timestamp of those used in the entries. But by default the Zend\_Feed\_Builder\_Header set the LastUpdate as now()...

Wouldn't be smarter, if not specified it take the max timestamp of the entries ?

The component already offers a parameter for setting this.
