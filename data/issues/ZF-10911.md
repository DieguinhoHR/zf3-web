### Description

Automatical handling of languages as described [here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.translate.additional.html#zend.translate.additional.languages.automatic) doesn't work. First because if the context option is a filename not as a directory, the scan option isn't even read, so the translation data will be added as the default local (de\_AT). And also because auto local detection does not work when adding a translation via the constructor.

When taking a look a the Adapter code, the last instruction of the Adapter constructor is to set the local, if the current local is different of the $options['locale']. But this is always true if $options['locale'] is set to 'auto'. This patch should fix the bug :

 
    <pre class="highlight">

So you want to use directory options for a single filename. The 'scan' option defines how a directory structure is scanned. It will not be processed when a single file is given.

This patch will not be added. Actually your code breaks translation in 40% of the cases. Please give an example what you want to archive and what the actual results are.

Well in fact the part with the scan option not being used when a single file is given is just an error in the documentation, the real problem is that auto local detection does not work when adding a translation via the constructor. For exemple : Create a file /tmp/locales/my\_fr.php :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    return array('MESSAGE_ID' => 'MESSAGE FR');


Then let's take the documentation exemple :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // 
    // Let's expect the browser returns these language settings:
    // HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE = "en-US,en;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6";
    // Example 2:
    // Best found fitting language is 'fr'
    $translate = new Zend_Translate(
        array(
            'adapter' => 'Array',
            'content' => '/tmp/locales/',
            'locale'  => 'auto',
            'scan' => Zend_Translate::LOCALE_FILENAME
        )
    );
    
    $local = $translate->getLocale();
    $translation = $translate->translate('MESSAGE_ID');
    var_dump($local, $translation);


Expected Result :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(2) 'fr'
    string(10) 'MESSAGE FR'


Actual Result :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: The language 'en_US' has to be added before it can be used. in /var/www/lib/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 429
    
    Notice: No translation for the language 'en' available. in /var/www/lib/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 442
    string(2) "en"
    string(10) "MESSAGE_ID"


In fact in Zend/Translate/Adapter.php the local is correctly setted to 'fr' at line 176 by $this->addTranslation($options); but it's overwritten at line 179. I don't think that the setLocale should be call when $options['locale'] == 'auto' and the local as been correctly detected.

With 'scan' you said that the directory /tmp/locales/ should be searched and the language of found translation files can be found within the filename.

So /tmp/locales/my\_fr degrades to the language my and the language fr and will be added to both locales. Maybe not in older releases of CLDR as my has been added about 8 months ago.

With 'locale' you said that the language 'auto' should be used. 'auto' degrades to the users browser. When the user sets 'ar' within his browser Zend\_Translate will use the language 'ar'.

As you don't have added a translation file for the language 'ar' (or in your case 'en\_US') an NOTICE is given. Note that notices are no exceptions and also no errors.

Yes I understand all that, what I say it's that according to the documentation if the user sets 'en' and 'fr' in his browser (for exemple by setting his HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE to "en-US,en;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6"), Zend\_Translate should use the best fitting language, so if there is no translation for 'en-US' or 'en', Zend\_Translate should fall back on the 'fr' language if there is a translation available in 'fr'.
