### Description

Class: Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps\_ServiceException Method: importFromString Line: 154

This is the same issue of using track\_errors that is described in [ZF-7305](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7305) (in fact the code seems identical - maybe a copy-paste from Zend\_Feed?):

{quote} I have noticed that when loading XML files the silencing ('@') operator + the track\_errors directive + the $php\_errormsg variable are used to suppress and detect XML parsing errors. This is probably a pretty bad practice for several reasons (performance, usage of a global variable which apparently sometimes xDebug suppresses, changing INI directives at runtime etc.).

For this specific reason, PHP supports a much more straightforward method to gracefully handle XML parsing errors - using the libxml\_use\_internal\_errors(), libxml\_use\_internal\_errors(), etc. functions. Those apply on both DOM and SimpleXML (and anything else using libxml) and are (at least IMHO) "cleaner" than using the track\_errors INI directive. {quote}
