### Description

Hi,

It looks like there is a small typo within "caution" part of section 37.4.2 (Zend\_Pdf): bq.Important! Cloned page shares some PDF resources with a template page, so it can be used only _withing_ the same document... It may be "within".

By the way, "caution" img does not load (cf. screenshot)

Regards, Remy

The caution tag is used only in the section.

I find the same problem with ``` tag also in following.

Zend\_Db\_Table.xml Zend\_Registry.xml Zend\_Rest\_Client.xml Zend\_Search\_Lucene-Charset.xml
