### Description

We should add a news archive for our mailing list. This is also the way the php internal mailing lists work.

A news archive would have the advantage that every subscriber will have the themes sorted and presented as expected, by theme and not by date, author or title. News archives are easier to handle by using a news client instead of an email client.

I think many people would preferr a news archive.

Certainly, the speed, convenience, efficiency, and searchability would better fit many users' preferences. News readers offer tremendous value in these areas.

Until we have a news archive, we can use: [http://nabble.com/Zend-Framework-Community-f16154.â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend-Framework-Community-f16154.html)

The mailing list archive at Nabble.com is sufficient for the foreseeable future.
