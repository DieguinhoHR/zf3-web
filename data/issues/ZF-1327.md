### Description

I have had trouble getting feeds from websites using the findFeeds() function. I have tracted the issue down to the way attributes are retrieved from the simplexml object.

On line 318 of the file Zend/Feed.php $feed = self::import($attributes['href']);

The attribute $attributes['href'] returns a simplexml attribute object. This complicates things further along when the uri is to be validated as seen here: On line 221 of the file Zend/Http/Client.php - the function setUri() if (is\_string($uri) && Zend\_Uri\_Http::check($uri)) {

Since is\_string($uri) only accepts strings - the $uri being a simplexml attribute object will not get validated and thus an exception is later on thrown.

I propose something along the lines of retrieving the href attribute by typecasting the value to string: $feed = self::import( (string) $attributes['href']);

I'm using php 5.2.1
