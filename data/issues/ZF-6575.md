### Description

By default it seems to search by all lower cased paths in the views/scripts/ but if a name is passed into zf create project that's upper cased (Fubar instead of fubar) it creates the path as views/scripts/Fubar which doesn't play nice: Message: script 'fubar/index.phtml' not found in path (/path/to/application/views/scripts/)
