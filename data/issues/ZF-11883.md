ZF-11883: Zend\_Cloud\_StorageService\_Adapter\_FileSystem::storeItem() should create intermediate folders

### Description

I am using the Zend\_Cloud\_StorageService as I am hoping to use the FileSystem adapter on internal servers and the S3 adapter on external servers.

I think it is therefore wrong that Zend\_Cloud\_StorageService\_Adapter\_FileSystem::storeItem() requires that the path provided in the first argument already exists within the path specified when instantiating the class.

I expect Zend\_Cloud\_StorageService\_Adapter\_FileSystem::storeItem() to behave the same as the S3 adapter, so that it automatically creates those intermediate folders. Therefore I can easily switch between implementations of Zend\_Cloud\_StorageService\_Adapter.
