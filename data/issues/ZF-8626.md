### Description

Hello,

??compareDate?? method doesn't return date as docs says:

@return Zend\_Date new date

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $valor1 = '28/03/2010 09:45:00';
    $valor2 = '03/04/2010 09:45:00';
    
    $fecha_inicio_compare = new Zend_Date($valor1,'es_ES');
    $fecha_fin_compare = new Zend_Date($valor2,'es_ES');
    
    $difference = $fecha_fin_compare->compareDate($fecha_inicio_compare); 
    
    echo $difference;


Also, there isn't a clear example on how to substract dates and obtain days or years for birthday date.

Closing as non-issue

The manual states: {quote} compares $part of $date to this object's timestamp, returning 0 if they are equal, 1 if this object's part was more recent than $date's part, otherwise -1. {quote}

As the manual describes Zend\_Date's compare() and all subsequent methods are returning integer 0, 1 or -1 like PHP's compare() method.

Hi,

I'm talking about API doc.

What about to add a clear example on how to obtain days or year for dates substraction?

Thank you so much.

if "Closing as non-issue", why did you commit the patch?.

This issue has been closed as "non-issue" because you stated that there is a problem within the documentation which was not the case. There was no patch attached to this issue which has been committed.

There may still be changes to a component when an issue is closed as "non-issue" and something different has been changed but it could be side-related to the issue.

Hi, are we reading the same?

There is not an "API doc" category in JIRA, only "Documentation" and is an obligatory field. Clearly I wrote "@return Zend\_Date new date", indicating this is a trivial issue in PHPDoc.

The "patch" (source changed to r19964) is in the "source" [tab](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8626?page=com.atlassian.jirafisheyeplugin:fisheye-issuepanel)
