ZF-6825: Query parser ignores 
------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-27T09:54:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:53.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Given the wildcard search term with only a single letter prefiex (such as "b\*, or with a field name such as "name:b\*") then the query parser ignores the prefix letter.

Given "name:b\*" Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse will return:

object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Boolean)[69] private '\_subqueries' => array 0 => object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Wildcard)[71] private '\_pattern' => object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term)[70] public 'field' => string 'name' (length=4) public 'text' => string '\*' (length=1)

Given two letters, such as name:be\*, then it works as expected:

(object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Boolean)[69] private '\_subqueries' => array 0 => object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Wildcard)[72] private '\_pattern' => object(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term)[70] public 'field' => string 'name' (length=4) public 'text' => string 'be\*' (length=3)

The letters are also ignored if there is one either side of the wildcard ("a\*a"), and only seem to be included if there are two together. I presume this is a bug in 1.7.3, but it could be down to a setting that I haven't seen in the documentation.
