### Description

Following Ryan's advice in ZF-10930 to cache the prepared statement returned by execute(), I did the following:

1) subclass Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli and Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql, and implement query() as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            private $cachePreparedStatement = array();
    
        public function query($sql, $bind = array())
        {
            if(isset($this->cachePreparedStatement[$sql]))
            {
                if (!is_array($bind)) {
                    $bind = array($bind);
                }
    
                $stmt = $this->cachePreparedStatement[$sql];
                $stmt->execute($bind);
                return $stmt;
            }
    
            $stmt = parent::query($sql, $bind);
            $this->cachePreparedStatement[$sql] = $stmt;
            return $stmt;
        }


I then do something like (pseudo-code):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $db->insert(QUERY1, BIND1);
        $db->select(...); // read back the values previously inserted (from BIND1)
        $db->insert(QUERY1, BIND2);
        $db->select(...); // read back the values previously inserted (from BIND2)


With Mysqli, the second insert() appears to not execute, because the select fails.

On the other hand, Pdo\_Mysql works as expected. (And both work if I revert this change.)

Sorry. Found a similar ticket. Looks like this is a dupe of ZF-2388.
