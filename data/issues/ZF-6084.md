Please do not commit this to incubator until Zend\_Navigation is approved. Feel free to put it in a user branch until then, however.

Committed with r14423 into /standard/branches/user/freak/Zend/Application/Resource/Navigation.php

Things that may be added are ACL injection, translater injection and role assignment.

Please review and move/copy file appropriately (after approval of Zend\_Nav).
