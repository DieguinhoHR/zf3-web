### Description

I'm not 100% sure that this is a bug, or whether or not I'm using locales inappropriately, however by relying on the en\_GB locale and allowing everything to hook into that, such as Zend\_Date, ZendX\_JQuery, etc. is yielding unexpected results when converting the date format.

The date format for en\_GB long and medium is "d MMM y", which when converted from the user input to ISO gets you an unexpected result.

For example - User input is "1 Jan 10", which is validated by ZF When converted to ISO format this yields 0010-01-01.. etc.

Whilst I totally understand why, it would seem more appropriate for the dateformat for long and short to be "d MMM yyyy" by default.

I'll add that if I'm using locales inappropriately what is the expected way for me to be able to override the various date formats? I'm aware of Zend\_Locale\_Format::setOptions(), but it doesn't appear to allow me to override the individual formats :)

The dateformat for long in en\_GB is: d MMMM y Whilst the medium format is d MMM y

These are not equal. What you are refering to is full which is: EEEE, d MMMM y

Note that you here directly within the internals. These are provided by unicode and not by Zend and they are worldwide agreed. When there is a problem with those data you should open a issue within unicode itself (<http://unicode.org/cldr>)

When you need to format/change/work with dates you should use Zend\_Date which allows you to change/define your own format.

Zend\_Locale itself does NOT provide date methematics. It is also not able to convert dates to ISO.
