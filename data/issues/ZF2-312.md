I've modified Module to be ModuleManager, and InputFilter is now available; can you provide a list of missing components, or components that need renames?

Zend\\Application (removed) Zend\\Controller -> Zend\\Mvc\\Controller Zend\\DocBook (new) Zend\\EventManager (new) Zend\\Layout (removed) Zend\\Math (new) Zend\\Rest (new) Zend\\Tool (removed)

and at least one generic component for Zend\\Service\*
