ZF-6346: The WSDL documentation element must be the first child of the documented node
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl, the addDocumentation() method _appends_ the documentation element to the documented node. This is invalid with regard to the [WSDL XML Schema ](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/) as well as the [WS-I Basic Profile 1.1](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1-2004-08-24.html#WSDL_documentation_Element), and can cause validation errors. The documentation element must be the _first child_ of the node.

This patch fixes the issue mentioned above, and updates the method's docblock to explain why the 'documentation' element is used instead of 'document'. Basically, the WSDL spec is wrong, the WSDL schema is right and confirmed by the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.

I had to made some changes to your patch since it did not lead to the correct result in all cases.

Committed to trunk and 1.8 release branch.
