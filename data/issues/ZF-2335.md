### Description

Once unit testing for each file of the component reaches 80% LOC coverage and there exists satisfactory DocBook documentation for the APIs, the Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable component needs to be promoted to core (i.e., moved to trunk with unit tests and documentation integrated).

What is the status on this? Will it be included in the preview release?

Unit tests are >90% code coverage by line counts and are located: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/incubator/tests/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/DbTableTest.php)

Some documentation is located here: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/incubator/documentation/manual/en/module_specs/Zend_Session_SaveHandler_DbTable.xml)

As you know the the savehandler: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Session/SaveHandler/DbTable.php)

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

I would like to get this in to 1.6. Jordan, I'm reassigning to you. If there is nothing left for you to do, please re-assign it to me and indicate that it is ready for promotion. Thanks.
