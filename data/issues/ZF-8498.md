### Description

The renderSubMenu() method in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu class seems to ignore the minDepth & maxDepth options which is quite annoying for the project I'm currently using Zend\_Navigation for.

Let's take the following hypothetical navigation structure:

- Home -- Item 1 -- Item 2 --- Subitem 1 --- Subitem 2 -- Item 3

Home is hierarchically the rootnode of my navigation whereas item 1, 2 & 3 are my main navigation items. Subitem 1 & subitem 2 are used in the subnavigation.

Rendering the main navigation goes as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    Rendering the subnavigation is impossible using the renderSubMenu() method because the minDepth & maxDepth options are completely ignored. This lack of depth filtering results in the main navigation being rendered in the subnavigation when "home" is the active page.
    
    The workaround I use is the following:
    


Via this workaround I'm sure the correct depth is shown and by setting renderParents to false and onlyActiveBranch to true I'm sure the \_renderDeepestMenu() method is triggered.

I'd like to know if it would be possible to allow an options array in the method argument list which only allows minDepth & maxDepth. This would make the rendering of subnavigations much more flexible.

{quote}The renderSubMenu() method in the Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu class seems to ignore the minDepth & maxDepth options…{quote} This is the documented behaviour:

 
    <pre class="highlight">/**

    public function renderSubMenu(Zend_Navigation_Container $container = null,
                                  $ulClass = null,
                                  $indent = null,
                                  $ulId   = null)

I have an idea to extend renderSubMenu, but I must check this with some unit tests.
