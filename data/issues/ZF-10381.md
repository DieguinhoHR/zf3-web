### Description

The method testOptionsPassedToResourceAreUsedToSetLocaleState1() fails without locale configured (or if your locale configured is the same as the default value tested).

I propose to add a test to skip this test if you can not succeed.

@Dolf: Forgot my patch. I don't see how the test can be completed without call the function setlocale().
