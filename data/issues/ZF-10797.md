### Description

say you changed is\_null() calls to use === in ZF-5413, why not improve array\_key\_exists -> isset?

here's bare test on linux:

$ time php -r '$a=array("a"=>1);for ($i=0; $i<100000000;$i++){ isset($a["a"]);}' real 0m10.655s user 0m10.626s sys 0m0.030s

$ time php -r '$a=array("a"=>1);for ($i=0; $i<100000000;$i++){ array\_key\_exists("a", $a);}' real 0m49.931s user 0m49.883s sys 0m0.043s

Because array\_key\_exists() behaves differently from isset() when null values come into play. Proposing to close as not an issue.

I suppose it could be changed out in a few components where doing so would not change behavior but I think in a lot of cases as Dolf says, it has been used intentionally instead of isset().

(EDIT) Is there a specific component or code fragment that you see where you propose to replace array\_key\_exists() with isset()?

40 seconds over 100 million calls!

Thats 0.0000004 of a second per call!

This only shows that the performance difference is negligible, and so the usage should be determined by the behaviour desired, and not the performance involved.

if this sort of difference were apparent over only 1000 or so calls I may have been convinced.

As noted by others, array\_key\_exists() and isset() will return different results for the same context in a variety of situations. In many instances, one is chosen over the other with those contexts in mind. Additionally, as also noted, the performance difference is negligible for most common operations; we simply will not be calling the operators often enough for this to be anything other than a micro-optimization.

Yes, in many cases, we use "null === $value" instead of "is\_null($value)" -- this, too, is really just a micro-optimization, and likely we should not introduce such changes unless there is a true semantic need.

Closing as "won't fix" -- I don't see any overwhelming evidence showing a benefit, and in fact see a number of cases where making the change would break code.
