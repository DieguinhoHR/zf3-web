### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Returns TRUE if the length of a string is within the specified range.
    * Range is inclusive by default.
    *
    * @param string $value
    * @param integer $min
    * @param integer $max
    * @param bool $inc
    * @return bool
    **/
    public static function isLengthBetween($value, $min, $max, $inc = TRUE)
    {
        $length = strlen($value);
    
        if ($inc)
            return (bool) ( $length >= $min && $length <= $max );
    
        return (bool) ( $length > $min && $length < $max );
    }


I find myself patching Filter.php with this function on each new release.

[Zend\_Validate\_StringLength](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/browse/Zend_Framework/trunk/incubator/library/Zend/Validate/StringLength.php) is now available in the incubator for providing this functionality.

I didn't catch Zend::Validate before. It looks very promising.

Shouldn't this functionality be part of Zend::Filter as well? As is alnum, alpha, etc. Or is Validate meant to replace Filter?

Good question. The Zend\_Validate component is meant for validation, and currently contains classes for the functions of the current Zend\_Filter class that perform validation (e.g., isAlpha()). The new Zend\_Filter component contains classes for the functions of the current Zend\_Filter class that perform filtering (e.g., noTags()). Though filtering and validation are very often used in conjunction, the concrete implementation of filters differs slightly from validators. Whereas a filter generally returns some transformation of its input (e.g., string), a validator returns a boolean of whether the input passed the validation criteria. A validator should also provide information about why the input failed validation, so the Zend\_Validate\_Interface provides a getMessages() method for this purpose when a particular validation should fail. For more information, you might see the [Zend\_Filter design proposal](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/Wi8).
