I just tested my dojo demo, which includes all form dijits supported by Zend\_Dojo, as well as TabContainer, with a 1.2.0 build, and all worked as expected. This should be a no-brainer for 1.7.0

Updated in trunk, and will release with 1.7.0

will dojo 1.1.1 stay the default for 1.x? or will 1.2.x become the default version setCdnVersion('1.2') is needed at the moment

Current trunk already has the CDN version set to default to 1.2.0.
