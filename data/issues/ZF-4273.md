ZF-4273: Exceptions thrown inside or after a call to Zend\_Rest\_Server::setClass() are swallowed

### Description

Exceptions thrown inside Zend\_Rest\_Server::setClass are effectively swallowed.

This is because inside Zend\_Rest\_Server::\_\_construct, on line 93, we have the following:

 
        set_exception_handler(array($this, "fault"));


This means that any uncaught exceptions are passed to Zend\_Rest\_Server::fault (even if it's thrown from somewhere else, outside the Zend\_Rest\_Server class instance.

This caused me some frustration when I inadvertently had a mismatch in the PHPDoc block for one the methods I was exposing via the Zend\_Rest\_Server interface. When I called Zend\_Rest\_Server::setClass('My\_Class'), eventually an exception was thrown on line 344 in the Zend\_Server\_Reflection\_Function class. Here's the excerpt:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (count($paramTypesTmp) != $paramCount) {
                throw new Zend_Server_Reflection_Exception(
                   'Variable number of arguments is not supported for services (except optional parameters). '
                 . 'Number of function arguments must currespond to actual number of arguments described in a docblock.');
            }


The problem was I had a PHPDoc block that was out of sync with the actual method signature. But the real problem was that instead of an exception explaining this, I got a blank page. I eventually tracked it down to the fact that Zend\_Rest\_Server::fault() was catching the exception and effectively swallowing it--actually, it was returning a DOMDocument, which if I had been inside Zend\_Rest\_Server::handle(), would have been printed on the screen. But uncaught exceptions thrown from anywhere else just result display a blank screen.

This same error is appearing in release 1.7.6, with a different scenario. ex. public function getusers(); // throws "Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Server\_Reflection\_Exception'"

public function getusers($userid); // does not throw error

private function getusers(); // does not throw error

Error is only thrown when function is declared public with no parameters.

Environment: Mac 10.5.6 XAMPP for Mac OS X 0.7.4
