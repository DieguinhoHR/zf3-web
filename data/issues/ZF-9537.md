I don't see how this is an issue. the layout isn't dependent on the view. Also, the Navigation resource plugin that is shipped with Zend Framework bootstraps Zend\_View, but only when it is dependent on it.

This is an issue if you use a custom view helper in the layout file and zend navigation.

The above fix of inserting $this->bootstrap('view') before the layout bootstrap fixes this issue, but not without a lot of searching trying to work out why the helper wasn't available when it's defined correctly in application.ini.
