### Description

Pages don't get cached if using default options of Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page.

Currently \_makeId() function returns false inside the foreach loop if $tmp2 === false. Instead it should continue; (it works, tested) as the start() function simply exits if the return value of $this->\_makeId() === false.

_CURRENT CODE_ {quote} $tmp2 = $this->_makePartialId($arrayName, $this->\_activeOptions['cache\_with_' . strtolower($arrayName) . '_variables'], $this->\_activeOptions['make\_id\_with_' . strtolower($arrayName) . '\_variables']);

 
            if ($tmp2 === false) \{
                *return false;*
            \} {quote}


_CORRECT CODE_ {quote} $tmp2 = $this->_makePartialId($arrayName, $this->\_activeOptions['cache\_with_' . strtolower($arrayName) . '_variables'], $this->\_activeOptions['make\_id\_with_' . strtolower($arrayName) . '\_variables']);

 
            if ($tmp2 === false) \{
                *continue;*
            \}{quote}


If you add the following line... bq. Zend\_Debug::dump($tmp2, '$tmp2 - ' . $arrayName);

...right after "$tmp2 = ..." (line 343) you get the following: {quote}$tmp2 - Get string(0) "" $tmp2 - Post string(0) "" $tmp2 - Session string(0) "" $tmp2 - Files string(0) "" $tmp2 - Cookie bool(false){quote}

As you can see Cookie fails and the whole caching fails...

I suppose it's duplicated with #ZF-5350 ?

Probably, but I think I disabled the cache\_with\_cookie\_variables setting and it still didn't work.

The issue is still not fixed in 1.9.7. Is anyone still working on Zend\_Cache?

The following options are configured by default: \* cache\_with\_XXX\_variables => false

This means if one of the super globals arrays ($\_GET, $\_POST, $\_SESSION, $\_FILES, $\_COOKIE) have one or more values the cache will not be cached. (For example: If you started a session before $\_COOKIE contains the session variable)

The enabling caching for this you have to enable the cache\_with\_XXX\_variables options.

If this functionality isn't working for you I need content of your super globals.
