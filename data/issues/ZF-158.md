I'm experiencing errors now that the rewriteBase stuff has been added. I think those need to be resolved first before this is moved into the core.

Could you be more specific, Matthew? Maybe create a new issue and describe your problems in greater detail.

Matthew, what is the status of the issues with rewriteBase? Any outstanding? If so, please add those as issues to the system.

RewriteRouter moved to core (see Fisheye tab for changsets), any further issues other than problems with the move itself should be reported as separate issues.
