ZF-11411: Passing DOMDocument to handle() does not work
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-05-26T09:39:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-28T19:43:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.11.7 (02/Jun/11)

### Description

Zend\_Soap\_Server::handle() accepts a request in the form of DOMDocument, DOMNode, SimpleXMLElement, stdClass and of course string. The XML is saved by Zend\_Soap\_Server::\_setRequest() in a protected member $this->\_request. Instead of the protected member $this->\_request, the function parameter $request is used with SoapServer::handle(), wich silently fails if the request wasnt a string in the first place.

The fix is simple, but i guess this _should_ be tested in the first place, regardless of how hard it may be.

Can you demonstrate the failing use case with some code?
