### Description

I followed the QuickStart guide with litle additions Assume i had 2 actionControllers, IndexController and NewsController in default module. The ErrorController worked fine with IndexController in term of action-not-found and controller-not-found (404), but not very correctly with NewsController. Its gave me below exception only when action-not-found, e.g /test.local/news/bogusaction

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Exception' with message 'Cannot send headers; headers already sent in F:\\projects\\test\\application\\controllers\\NewsController.php, line 2' in F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Response\\Abstract.php:281 Stack trace: #0 F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Response\\Abstract.php(196): Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract->canSendHeaders(true) #1 F:\\projects\\test\\application\\controllers\\ErrorController.php(39): Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract->setRawHeader('HTTP/1.1 404 No...') #2 F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Action.php(503): ErrorController->errorAction() #3 F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Dispatcher\\Standard.php(285): Zend\_Controller\_Action->dispatch('errorAction') #4 F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Front.php(934): Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard->dispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http), Object(Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http)) #5 F:\\projects\\test\\public\\index.php(41): Zend\_Controller\_Front->dispatch() #6 {main} throw in F:\\projects\\test\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Response\\Abstract.php on line 281

To verify the ErrorController worked correctly, i disable the line $this->getResponse()->setRawHeader('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found') and found it working fine, so the problem may be the Response tried to set the headers after the headers already sent. It sounds not right for me by 2 factors

1. When the ErrorController set the response headers, there is no output at this stage,
2. Why it not happends with the IndexController ?

I am now stuck, and file this issue. I hope this is just me.

Best Regards

Nam

Please, make sure that any of your PHP file does not send headers. This can be done by forgetting the PHP closing tag, preventing invisible header leaks. Review your code and look for blank lines out of PHP that could have been forgotten and proceeded throught Apache

"headers already sent in F:\\projects\\test\\application\\controllers\\NewsController.php, line 2..."

Look at the complete PHP error message, it should include "output started at line XXX, file XXX"

Actually, not by "forgetting thePHP closing tag," but by including it, and having whitespace of some sort following it. Looking at the error message, it's clear that the problem is in userland code: "headers already sent in F:\\projects\\test\\application\\controllers\\NewsController.php, line 2" -- most likely the problem is in a userland file included from the NewsController.php file.Check to see what class files are included, and verify that they do not unintentionally send headers due to inclusion of whitespace outside of PHP tags.

Thank you Julien and Mathew. I feel embarrassing. It is clear that the white space is included before the PHP tag. It is my bad habit of cut and paste. Thank you guys again for speedy reply.

And for someone may encouter this, please notice the white space before the PHP tag

----- begin code -------- <----- this is where the white space included before the php tag <?php

class ServicesController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action {

 
    public function indexAction() {
        $this->view->title = " | News ::index";
    }
    public function b1Action() {
        $this->view->title = " | News ::b1";
        $this->render('index');
    }
    public function b2Action() {
        $this->view->title = " | News ::b2";
        $this->render('index');
    }


} // end class

------ end code ----
