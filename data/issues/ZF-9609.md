### Description

It would be so nice if there would be any way of limiting the Locales considered by Zend\_Locale 'auto'-detection setting.

List of Ideas: - Introduce Zend\_Locale::$\_available as array containing locales supported by the application. - Find a way to communicate with Zend\_Translate (Zend\_Locale setting 'translated') and ask for available locals

Limiting Zend\_Locale based on a class which itself is based on Zend\_Locale is nothing which should be implemented.

Other classes like Zend\_Currency could be in need of informations which would then not be possible to provide when there are limitations based on a non Locale class.

When you need limitations then simply use the application resource or extend it to your own needs.
