### Description

Calling db2\_stmt\_error() or db2\_stmt\_errormsg() without a statement resource parameter will also return the error message from the last operation, if there is one. This message is cached so no matter how many times it is called and as long as another SQL operation doesn't occur, it will return the same message

If either function is called with a statement resource, it will return the message associated with that particular resource. A subsequent call with the same resource parameter attempts to retrieve further diagnostic data. If there is no more diagnostic data, nothing is returned.

In the ZF, a particular method, such as execute(), may throw an exception. The exception object is populated with specific diagnostic information using db2\_stmt\_error() and db2\_stmt\_erromsg(). For example, this is what \_execute() looks like for the DB2 adapter:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($retval === false) {
       /**
        * @see Zend_Db_Statement_Db2_Exception
        */
       require_once 'Zend/Db/Statement/Db2/Exception.php';
             throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Db2_Exception(
                    db2_stmt_errormsg($this->_stmt),
                    db2_stmt_error($this->_stmt));
    }


When an application detects an exception it may try to call errorCode() or errorInfo(). The problem is that both these methods call db2\_stmt\_error() with the $this->\_stmt instance variable again.  
 For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       public function errorCode()
        {
            if (!$this->_stmt) {
                return '0000';
            }
            
            return db2_stmt_error($this->_stmt);
        }


Since db2\_stmt\_error($this->\_stmt) has been previously called when the exception was generated, the driver attempts to obtain further diagnostic data. If there is none, nothing is returned giving the impression that there is no error message.

The patch removes the $this->\_stmt parameter from the errorCode() and errorInfo() methods so that repeated calls to db\_stmt\_error() and db2\_stmt\_errormsg() return the same message previously cached.

I will upload the patch as well as the modified DB2 unit test.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Solved in SVN r 13091. If no error occurs, errorCode() and errorInfo() method returns false like Oracle and MySqli.

Unit test not updated to reflect changes.

fixed in r13279, still needs merging - will do so close to next mini release.

I checked to be merged from trunk to branch/release-1.7.
