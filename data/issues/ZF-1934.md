### Description

I have code failing with exception like this: Stack trace:

0 /home/kgrecki/ZendFramework-1.0.1/library/Zend/Uri/Http.php(528): Zend\_Uri\_Http->\_parseQuery('source\_id=a&ur...')
=======================================================================================================================

1 /home/kgrecki/ZendFramework-1.0.1/library/Zend/Http/Client.php(800): Zend\_Uri\_Http->setQuery('source\_id=a&ur...')
======================================================================================================================

2 /home/tests/Case/Abstract.php(84): Zend\_Http\_Client->request()
==================================================================

I use http client for functional testing, grabbing requests from apache log and comparing responses. The problem is when a redirect happens and the destination url has malformed query string. It fails on validating the query string, probably because the url is not encoded. I think the client should behave the same as the browsers ale letting this url through. Currently I cannot test the response even when using 'maxredirects' => 0 because the exception is thrown before the request.

Can you paste here the URL that the client tries to redirect to? You can do that using such code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Set the first URI and all...
    
    $client->setConfig(array('maxredirects' => 0));
    $respons = $client->request(); 
    
    echo $response->getHeadersAsString();


and paste the output here.

This snippet will not work as it throws an exception on first ->request(), but it can be tested by commenting out this line //$this->uri->setQuery($query); in Http/Client.php The sample url would look like [http://localhost/redirect.php/â€¦](http://localhost/redirect.php?id=a&url=http://www.localhost/?id=foo) bar

It triggers 'Zend\_Uri\_Exception' with message 'Invalid URI supplied' if I try to connect to it directly using the client. I can understand why it's invalid, the thing is that it's being accepted by browsers. So I think the client should behave the same or at least have a configuration option that would allow this. Also the exception may be thrown prematurely as this url is never requested in my code if I use maxredirects' => 0 so maybe the url validation should be done later before the actual request to redirected url. Hope that helps.

Zend\_Uri\_Http was fixed to encode query parameters which are not valid.

Should be resolved by revision 6654. If you can verify that, it would help greatly.
