ZF-10439: Invalid phpdoc @param type: constant

### Description

In the phpdoc comments of Zend\_Db\_Select for functions where() and orWhere() there is a line @param constant $type

"constant" is not allowed here, it has to be "int". My IDE thinks an object of class "constant" is needed there and reports wrong parameter usage.
