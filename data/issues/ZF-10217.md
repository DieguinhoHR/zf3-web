### Description

Hai, I created form in zend framework like these class Form\_taxtip extends Zend\_Form { $rate=$this->createElement('text', 'rate')->addValidator('Float',true); $this->addElement($rate); }

when i am trying to submit this form , i got validation error ,If the value is less than 10

For Eg:- when i try to enter 9.6 ,the validation error is like these Array ( [rate] => Array ( [notFloat] => '9.6' does not appear to be a float ) ) This error appear only less than 10.but when i try to enter greater than 10 ,NO error display on my page.

Please try to explain this reason.If it is my mistake what is the actual use of Folat validater?

Thank you . jagadeesh

Can you please give additional informations?

Which values are entered? Which values fail the validation? Which locale is being used?

Possible reason is that you are using a different locale. Example: User enters "9.6" but is using german as locale. This will return false because "9,6" is a german float but "9.6" not.

(1)Which locale is being used? when i try to execute the code $locale = new Zend\_Locale(); echo "  
Language is : ".$locale->getLanguage(); echo "  
Location : ". $locale->findLocale();

THE OUTPUT IS : Language is : en Location : en\_IN So i think it is English.

(2)Which values are entered?(FAILED VALUES) (a) When i try to enter '1' => Error is like these : Array([rate] => Array ( [notFloat] => '1' does not appear to be a float ) ) (b) When i try to enter '1.5' => Error is like these : Array([rate] => Array ( [notFloat] => '1.5' does not appear to be a float ) ) (c) When i try to enter '1,5' => Error is like these : Array([rate] => Array ( [notFloat] => '1,5' does not appear to be a float ) ) (d) When i try to enter '9.5' => Error is like these : Array([rate] => Array ( [notFloat] => '9.5' does not appear to be a float ) ) (SUCCESS VALUES) (e) When i try to enter '10.0' => No error (f) When i try to enter '10.5' => No error That means IF THE VALUE IS LESS THAN 10 THE ERROR WILL DISPLAY IF THE VALUE IS GREATER THAN 10 ERROR DOES NOT DISPLAY.

According to your comment the following example should fail but does not:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $valid = new Zend_Validator_Float('en_IN');
    var_dump($valid->isValid(1.5));
    var_dump($valid->isValid(9.5));


Can you give additional informations? Because I can not see any failed behaviour within the component.

Closing as not reproduceable
