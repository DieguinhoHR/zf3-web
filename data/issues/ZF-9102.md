### Description

For example: <http://zftest> instead of <http://zftest/path> (or something more likely to be used from a proper domain). There is a dirname() call on line 515 which spots the lack of a path separator and assumes this is root-like on linux, this substituting in a single separator at the end of the domain. This is expected dirname() behaviour. Zend\_Http\_Client behaviour is NOT impacted, this is just a small test code issue.
