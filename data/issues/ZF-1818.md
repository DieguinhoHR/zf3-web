ZF-1818: Create utilities to construct Feed and Entry URLs
----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The feed and entry URLs in GData APIs are frequently composed from a template consisting of things like "user", "security", "projection". It might be helpful for users of services if there were a library distributed with each service's client lib that did the URL construction for you.

So from a user's point of view, a feed would be requested not by providing a URL, but by providing the parameters that instantiate the URL template. The user would not necessarily see the URL itself.

NOTE: These utilities exist for many of the PHP client lib services, but we need to verify that they exist for all before closing out this bug.

As far as I can tell, the PHP client lib already does this for all supported services.
