Attached a patch to allow use of File and Directory in ZF Profiles, plus the ability to change "filesystemName" attribute for each of the ZF context resources to allow for any custom profile layout using the existing resources.

Use-Cases: \* People have alternate names for certain resources, currently they can't use Zend\_Tool project at all. \* Already existing projects cannot easily be ported to a Zend\_Tool project if there is no support for alternate names.

For example: 1. Projects that use the folder application/config instead of application/configs 2. Projects that have a different location for the Bootstrap class/file that is used with Zend\_Application
