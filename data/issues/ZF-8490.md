### Description

In the German ZF-Docs is a little mistake on Zend\_View\_Helper: Wenn eine Seite vom ACL nicht akzeptiert ist, wird auch jede untergeordnete Seite von der Darstellung ausgenommen sein. {color:red} If a page is not accepted by ACL, any descendant page will also be excluded from rendering.{color}

This sentence is to much/the same sentence in English.

Please write how it should be corrected instead of writing that it's "too equal to the english version".

A sentence does not need to be different in other languages when it's translated.

"This is my house" "Das ist mein Haus"

Could also be noted as "too equal", but it's a correct translation ;-)

Yes, it a correct translation, just the red text is a remnant you could delete :) !

Closing as non-issue.

The marked sentence is not available within the german translation.

Maybe it has already been fixed in past.
