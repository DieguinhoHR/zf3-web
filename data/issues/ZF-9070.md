ZF-9070: Zend\_Mail::\_filterEmail() invalidates some addresses 
----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-03T02:46:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-03T11:05:53.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Mail::\_filterEmail() strips out double quotes from e-mail addresses, but this invalidates certain addresses (i.e. ones where the local part contains control characters) causing errors further down the line.

<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#page-6>

So (for instance) if a recipient "abc@def"@example.com is added, the quotes are stripped but the @ in the local part is not escaped with a backslash and so the address becomes invalid. I imagine the same would happen with a number of other control characters.

For further reading: [http://groups.google.com/group/eaut/â€¦](http://groups.google.com/group/eaut/web/rules-for-valid-email-addresses?pli=1) and <http://www.remote.org/jochen/mail/info/chars.html>

My problem is an email address like "Mr.O'Reilley@example.com". The problem is the single quote. This address gives the following error: "511 sorry, recipient address has invalid format (#5.1.1 - chkuser)" - which is incorrect, becaue it is a valid email address.

We've already quite a few of those addresses signed up now - and that's just the closed-beta phase without being live. I hope for a fix rather soon.

Any suggestions on how I can do a hot-fix/hack until it's officially fixed?

After further investigation, it probably is more likely to be an issue in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp->rcpt();

Apologies guys! Turns out that the SMTP Server doesn't accept the message! FZ seems not to be at fault. :-)

I can't speak for Chris and his initial issue, since I didn't test that. The issue I was having turned out to be not related to this. Sorry for any confusion caused.

Yep, the issue is still active.

Ideally \_filterEmail() shouldn't remove content; it should quote or backslash escape if it finds special characters. For instance, a comma is perfectly valid in "foo,bar"@example.com or foo\\,bar@example.com.

I guess one difficulty is detecting whether a valid (pre-filtered) e-mail address has been provided, or whether it needs to be filtered.

Oleg, Sorry to say that I am in inactive for component fixes.

Because sadly, document modifications eat up my time. There are too many modifications in document since last winter.
