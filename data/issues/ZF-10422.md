### Description

If a Form element decorated with a viewHelper is of Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewHelper::\_buttonTypes, it takes it's value from it's label. However, if you have a Element that doesn't extend any of these buttonTypes, but still renders out a form button, it ends up with no value.

Came across then when implementing the JQuery's button() for submit buttons.

class My\_ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_SubmitButton extends ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_UiWidget { public function submitButton($id, $value = "", array $params = array(), array $attribs = array()) { $attribs = $this->\_prepareAttributes($id, $value, $attribs);

 
        if(!isset($params['start']) && is_numeric($value)) {
            $params['start'] = $value;
        }
    
        if(count($params)) {
            $params = ZendX_JQuery::encodeJson($params);
        } else {
            $params = '{}';
        }
    
        $js = sprintf('%s("#%s").button(%s);',
            ZendX_JQuery_View_Helper_JQuery::getJQueryHandler(),
            $attribs['id'],
            $params
        );
    
        $this->jquery->addOnLoad($js);
    
        return $this->view->formSubmit($id, $value, $attribs);
    }


}

The class delegates the rendering to formSubmit, but because My\_ZendX\_JQuery\_View\_Helper\_Button doesn't extend any class named in \_buttonTypes, $value is null, as the code in getValue doesn't call getLabel as it doesn't identify it as a buttonType.
