ZF-970: Small bug in logic of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::assemble() with $reset = true

### Description

I think that Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route::assemble() must use default values for all parameters if $reset = true. For now it doesn't use defaults. For example, I have route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$router->addRoute('releases', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route('press/releases/:id', 
        array('controller' => 'releases', 'action' => 'release', 'module' => 'default')));

and url

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    in some plugin for front controller I want to assemble default uri for route with name 'releases'. I'm doing like this


$route = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance()->getRouter()->getCurrentRoute(); $path = $route->assemble(array(), true);

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    and recieve in path


but I want to recieve

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    That is a quick fix:


elseif (isset($this->\_values[$part['name']])) { + } elseif (! $reset && isset($this->\_values[$part['name']])) {```

And small additional question. Why assemble() adds default param values to assembled uri? These values are the dafaults for params. And params will have them btw.

Fixed.

And to answer your comment question, Sergey - I'm not sure if I get your meaning correctly but let me guess. You have to check the defaults because you may be executing assemble on a route that wasn't previously matched. So these routes won't have any initialized values but the defaults.
