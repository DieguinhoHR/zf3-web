### Description

Hello.

I'm trying to use the forward function in the \_\_construct in my controller abstract.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_forward( 'denied', 'errors' );


I got this respons:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    An error occurred
    Page not found
    Exception information:
    
    Message: Action "denied" does not exist and was not trapped in __call()
    Stack trace:
    
    #0 library\Zend\Controller\Action.php(518): Zend_Controller_Action->__call('deniedAction', Array)
    #1 library\Zend\Controller\Dispatcher\Standard.php(295): Zend_Controller_Action->dispatch('deniedAction')
    #2 library\Zend\Controller\Front.php(954): Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard->dispatch(Object(Zend_Controller_Request_Http), Object(Zend_Controller_Response_Http))
    #3 library\Zend\Application\Bootstrap\Bootstrap.php(97): Zend_Controller_Front->dispatch()
    #4 library\Zend\Application.php(366): Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap->run()
    #5 Zend\public\index.php(27): Zend_Application->run()
    #6 {main}  
    
    Request Parameters:
    
    array (
      'controller' => 'contact',
      'action' => 'index',
      'module' => 'default',
    )  


if i go to: errors/denied it works.

The forward stays in the same contoller, if i create the function in the active controller it works. But thats is not how it sould work.

Can somebody help me?

Hi,

In Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard, line 285, there is "$request->setDispatched(true);", and this line is AFTER \_\_construct() and init() of the current controller. So, if you want use \_forward, you must use preDispatch(), else, the condition "} while (!$this->\_request->isDispatched());" line 966 in Zend\_Controller\_Front will be true, and controller name wille the same but not the Action ! It the reason ZF search an action in the current controller ! (number line is used for ZF 1.11.7) ;)

It's not a bug ;)
