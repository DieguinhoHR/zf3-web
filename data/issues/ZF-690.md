### Description

The engine can't index my large text file(it's size is 2.852.000 bytes, overall words count is about 460 thousands words, no special conents, just text only). It takes all memory(about 1 Gb memory and swap) and hangs my PC. I'm using Win2k3 server, IIS6, PHP-5.1.6 CGI module and Zend Framework 0.6.0 version.

Do you index one document per script execution?

If no, please try to use $index->commit(); after each documentAdd() call. (Or set _MaxBufferedDocs_ to 1 - $index->setMaxBufferedDocs(1))

What is _memory\_limit_ value in php.ini?

That would be also good, if you can attach this file to the issue (or send it to me).

The $index->setMaxBufferedDocs(1) is already set in my code. The $index->commit(); is used after each documentAdd() call. But the problem is the all memory used within the documentAdd() call. The script hangs up before commit() is executed. The memory\_limit is set to 128M but actually I'm using now the command line php interpreter which has no memory limits. The file is attached to the report.

I got the same result.

So attached file is helpful. I'll check, how it can be managed.

Fixed. Take an SVN version. Stream mode tokenization API is added to analyzer.

It still need a lot of memory for indexing, but much smaller. It took ~35Mb with PHP V5.1.4 and ~70Mb with PHP V5.2

PS Command line php also uses memory limit option from php.ini

Thanks. The SVN version solved my problem.

P.S. Thanks in advance.
