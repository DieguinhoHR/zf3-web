### Description

When trying to set the hidden property of a calendar event

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $event = $this->_gdata->newEventEntry();
    $event->title = $this->_gdata->newTitle($title);
    $event->where = array($this->_gdata->newWhere($address));
    $event->timezone = $this->_gdata->newTimezone($timezone);
    $event->visibility = $this->_gdata->newVisibility(true);
    $event->hidden = $this->_gdata->newHidden(false);
    
    $cal = $this->_gdata->insertEvent($event, '<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/default/owncalendars/full">http://google.com/calendar/feeds/…</a>');


I get a "Property \_hidden does not exist" error message because there is no \_hidden property defined in Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventEntry or Zend\_Gdata\_Kind\_EventEntry. Can we add the following to either one of those classes?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_hidden = null;

Is this still an issue? Is there a suggested fix?

Wow, I don't even remember submitting this issue, especially considering I haven't played around with Zend\_Gdata yet. I'm not sure if it's still an issue or not. I'd think this would have been caught awhile ago if it was still an issue though.

This is not implemented in _Zend\_Gdata_. However, as far as I understand Google Calendar API, the Hidden attribute does not have anything to do with the calendar +events+. There is only [gCal:hidden](http://code.google.com/intl/fi-FI/apis/calendar/data/2.0/reference.html#gCalhidden) element, which indicates whether a +calendar+ is visible or not. This is more like a documentation issue, where [ZF's Reference Guide](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.calendar.html#zend.gdata.calendar.creating_events.single) is misleadingly telling that Hidden (which is not even provided) removes the +event+ from the Google Calendar UI.

To implement a delete feature for calendar events, _Zend\_Gdata\_Kind\_EventEntry_ should have $\_deleted property which maps to [gd:Deleted](http://code.google.com/intl/fi-FI/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/elements.html#gdDeleted).

This was resolved in ZF-11101

I guess this was left open if someone would like to implement that $\_delete property ...

bq. To implement a delete feature for calendar events, Zend\_Gdata\_Kind\_EventEntry should have $\_deleted property which maps to gd:Deleted.

According to the docs for EventKind ([http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/…](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/elements.html#gdEventKind)) it doesn't explicitly have gd:Deleted. Do you know if it actually does (ie: inherited from parent namespace or something?)

Ah, that's true. But it is used by the kinds. [http://code.google.com/intl/fi-FI/…](http://code.google.com/intl/fi-FI/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/elements.html#gdReference)
