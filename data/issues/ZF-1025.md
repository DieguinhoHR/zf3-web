ZF-1025: Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request should not cast incoming XML encoding

### Description

line 256 of Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request reads:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $request = iconv('', $this->getEncoding(), $request);


For incoming XML, this can mangle the text so that it's unreadable by SimpleXMLElement. Removing the line fixes it in all instances.

Encoding should still be honored when _creating_ XML, just not for parsing it.

This is actually true for the loadXml() methods of each of the Fault, Request, and Response objects.
