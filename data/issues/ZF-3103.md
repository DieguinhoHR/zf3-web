ZF-3103: Pipe in URI Throws Exception

### Description

Pipes in URIs do not validate. The culprit is validateQuery() in Zend\_Uri\_Http.

The URI I was dealing with:

[http://images.google.com/images/â€¦](http://images.google.com/images?q=something&gbv=2&hl=en&sa=G&imgsz=small%7Cmedium%7Clarge%7Cxlarge)

I do understand that RFC 2396 does not include the pipe in the list of unreserved characters. That said, the above is a Google URI!

The question, which I leave up to you guys, is if the code should accommodate this infraction of sorts.

Cheers, Hakan
