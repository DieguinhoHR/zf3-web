Why should this be unexpected ?

You defined no input format but only a locale. The default date for en\_US is M/d/y/.

So the first input would result in year 12, month 2008 and day 11. Zend\_Date does autmatically correct this as strict is not set so what you get as output is the fixed date.

You second input on the other hand would result in year 30, month 2008 and day 11. Also here you did not set strict so Zend\_Date automatically corrects false input and switches values.

The result for you is that the output is sometimes correct even if the input was not.

So the solution is to check a date before using it as input when you do not give a defined format. Use isDate with strict setting to see if a date is in the format you expect, or give the appropiate format at creation of the instance because your output is not the default date format for the given locale.

This will be a big problem when using Zend\_Date to input a datetime field from the database.

Example: $a = new Zend\_Date($table->myDatetime);

A default datetime format of the database is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss. And the default locale is 'en'.

So, if we do not assign the locale, the date '2008-12-10 20:00:00' in database will be converted to year:2008, month:10, day:12 by Zend\_Date.

Don't you think this is a serious problem ?

Test Result: 2008-12-10 18:50:00 (In DB) Oct 12, 2008 6:50:00 PM (Export from Zend\_Date) en (Zend\_Date locale)

No this is not a big problem.

Because when you know the format you should also define it. The format you are using is different from the default format of the locale you set.
