ZF-11170: Issues with open\_basedir
-----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-03-14T00:01:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2013-01-22T14:39:36.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Getting the following open\_basedir error: {quote} Warning: is\_readable() [function.is-readable]: open\_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/share/pear/ZendX/Application/Resource/Frontcontroller.php) is not within the allowed path(s): {quote}

The weird thing is that there is no /usr/share/pear directory on my server, and if I add '/usr/share/pear' to the open\_basedir directive there is no change, the error is still there.

However, when I append the '/', '/usr' or '/usr/share' directories to the open\_basedir directive, the error goes away.

So, to summarize, it's looking for '/usr/share/pear' which does not exist, but is satisfied when I enter '/', '/usr', or '/usr/share'.

Seems like a bug to me

I changed the following code from ZendLoader::isReadable() :

$file = $path . '/' . $filename;

by :

$file = realpath($path . '/' . $filename);

imho this fix keeps the original purpose of the class methods.

It and works in this cases :

- $file contains some '/../', '//', or '/./' substring
- one of the open\_basedir PHP option paths doesn't exist, but this path contains the searched $file
