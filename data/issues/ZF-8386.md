### Description

The Zend\_Translate\_Adapter abstract class currently does its own (un-)serialization when a cache is set. The Zend\_Cache currently provides its own options for serializing data or not. I know that caching of the translate data won't work, unless it is serialized. However, this is a problem that concerns Zend\_Cache. Zend\_Translate\_Adapter should not have to care about serialization when utilizing a cache.
