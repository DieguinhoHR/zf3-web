ZF-8147: Database row does not update, Oracle, save

### Description

When Zend\_Db\_Row::save() is called using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle, the row in database does not update. This works fine in 1.9.3PL1.

The row does not get updated even though the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::update() statement returns a positive number of affected rows.

I found out that my extended framework overwrites the \_connect method to execute ALTER SESSSION queries. The \_connect function in 1.9.4 calls \_setExecuteMode(OCI\_COMMIT\_ON\_SUCCESS) while in 1.9.3PL1 the $\_execute\_mode parameter is set to OCI\_COMMIT\_ON\_SUCCESS by default.
