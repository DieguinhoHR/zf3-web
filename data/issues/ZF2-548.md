### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $object = new SomeObject();
    $object->setChildren( array(new SomeChild, new SomeChild));


If making $form->bind( $object ) then Collection element objects are not automatically set, but they have to be set manually. In MyForm extends Form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function bind( $object, $flags = 17 ) {
        parent::bind( $object );
        foreach( $object->getRows() as $i => $row ) {
            $this->get('Collection')->get($i)->setObject( $row );
        }
    }


This probably should work automatically. In current architecture it is hard to propose a good solution, as bind method only exists in Form. I would probably recommend adding bind method also to fieldsets. (logically objects are kept in Fieldset, so why there can't be bind method?
