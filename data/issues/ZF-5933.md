ZF-5933: Implement consistent use of \_\_toString() in all extension and data model classes.

### Description

All of our extension inherit on one way or another from Base.php which has a single \_\_toString() method defined as:

 
    public function __toString()
    {
        return $this->getText();
    }


It would be nice if all of the extensions implemented this better so that you can do what you can currently do with YouTube/Extension/Statistics.php:

$s = new Zend\_Gdata\_YouTube\_Extension\_Statistics(1, 2,3, 4,5); echo $s . "\\n";

outputs:
========

View Count=1 VideoWatchCount=2 SubscriberCount=3 LastWebAccess=4 FavoriteCount=5

Definition:

 
    public function __toString()
    {
        return 'View Count=' . $this->_viewCount .
            ' VideoWatchCount=' . $this->_videoWatchCount .
            ' SubscriberCount=' . $this->_subscriberCount .
            ' LastWebAccess=' . $this->_lastWebAccess .
            ' FavoriteCount=' . $this->_favoriteCount;
    }
