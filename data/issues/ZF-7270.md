ZF-7270: Changing the name property of an Zend\_Form\_Element does not change the index in the elements array in the container Zend\_Form

### Description

When needing to replace one element in an existing Zend\_Form container, the setName method does not change the key of this element.  
 This is crucial if you populate your form from an array of values.

(Use case: I have a form with variants where only the field names are changed, to be the same as in the DB).
