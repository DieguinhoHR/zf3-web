ZF-11553: Extending Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select static constants not functioning as expected

### Description

While trying to modify the select to work with oracle 8 I discovered overriding the join types does not work as expected. This is due to the use of the self keyword instead of the static keyword. This bug makes it impossible to add custom join types or override existing ones.

static $\_partsInit, $\_joinTypes, and $\_unionTypes, should be referenced with the static keyword instead of self. This will insure that the calling class is referenced, rather than always referencing Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select as self does.

Even better than having static arrays filled with compile-time constants, it would be better to have static methods which return arrays for $\_partsInit, $\_joinTypes, and $\_unionTypes.

Late static binding was introduced in php 5.3.0 while Zend Framework supports PHP 5.2.4 or later.
