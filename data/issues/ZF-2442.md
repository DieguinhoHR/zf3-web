ZF-2442: Zend\_Cache needs a "dummy" backend for non-production environments

### Description

I propose that a Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Dummy or Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Null be created. The class would implement Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface, but simply do nothing. This would help greatly when dealing with code that resides in multiple environments, for example a Sandbox and Production setup.

All application code would use the Cache object without issue.

This can already be accomplished using the "caching" frontend option.
