ZF-8031: Provide a static method for setting default filter that are always applied when Zend\_Form is used

### Description

Sometimes you may want to use certain filters as defaults in each instantiated Zend\_Form object. One example could be the StringTrim filter that helps you get rid of any accidental white spaces submitted by the user.

You could accomplish this by creating your own form class (that extends Zend\_Form) and adding some default filters in the constructor. This approach forces you to use your custom class, which may not be waht you really want.

Zend\_Form::setDefaultFilters(array) Zend\_Form::addDefaulFilter(..) etc...

I like the idea, but I wouldn't like to see it as a static method, but instead a method which can be called prior to adding elements to a form, so it will automagically add these filters when addElement is subsiquently called.

But the you would still have to call that method manually, each time you are using Zend\_Form, right?
