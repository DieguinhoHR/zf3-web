ZF-3533: Wrong initialisation of DOMDocument
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2008-06-28T04:02:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-06-30T01:01:03.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Search for line 113 in /Zend\_Feed/Abstract.php and replace it with:

 
        $doc = new DOMDocument();
        $doc->loadXML(&$this->_element);


Otherwise a php-notice will occur, saying, that a loadXml() should not be called statically.

Please only select "Patch" type if you really provide an SVN patch either as a diff view or as an attachment. The resolution itself can't be applied because:

- passing a variable as reference is deprecated
- the issue involves other parts of the same library

I'm closing this as duplicate of ZF-3124.
