### Description

Currently when a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object is created, its data is set by assigning explicit PHP values and then calling the save() method to INSERT/UPDATE the database record.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $table->fetchNew();
    $row->createDate = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
    $row->title = 'Awesome';
    $row->save();


My problem with this is that you are restricted to storing, for example, the time as reported by the web server. If I wanted to store the time as reported by the DB server, I can no longer use Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row.

A possible solution would be to reuse the Zend\_Db\_Expr object. Then the code would be written as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = $table->fetchNew();
    $row->createDate = new Zend_Db_Expr('NOW()');
    $row->title = 'Awesome';
    $row->save();
