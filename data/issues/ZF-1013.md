### Description

The ability to specify column aliases in a similar manner to table names.

_(This summarises the discussion from the mailing list with Bill Karwin)_

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter->select()->from('mytable', array(
        'alias1' => 'colA',
        'alias2' => new Zend_Db_Expr('fn(colB)'),
        'colC',
        'colD AS alias3',
        'alias4' => 'fncall2()',
        'fncall3() AS alias5'
    ));


It will work by checking the keys of the columns array, any key that is\_string() will be taken to be a column alias.

If a string matches the regular expression:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Then the string should be converted into the alias => column form.  It
    should be very rare that a column name matches that pattern.  This will
    make it easier for people to use "column AS alias" syntax in a simple
    string.
    
    Also if a column string matches the regular expression: 

Then the string should be converted into a Zend\_Db\_Expr. It should be very rare that a column name matches that pattern. This will make it easier for people to use common cases like "COUNT(\*)".

That last line should read:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    COUNT(*)


(just discovered the preview button!)

Fixed markup.

We discussed and implemented a small change to the regular expression for matching function calls in column strings.

Now the regular expression is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /\(.*\)/


This supports expressions such as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SQR(x)+1


It also means that any expression can be implicitly designated as a Zend\_Db\_Expr, simply by enclosing it in quotes. So a string like the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'x+10'


can be made into a Zend\_Db\_Expr in either of the following two ways:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new Zend_Db_Expr( 'x+10' )
    '(x+10)'


This change was made in revision 3881.

All the changes planned for this enhancement have been implemented as of revision 3881. Documentation has been updated.
