### Description

We can't change the charset of the connection between ZF and oracle.

the oci\_connect() function gets a $charset param but we can't define it with Zend\_Db::factory. The problem is located in the method \_connect() in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle

(from the php doc : resource oci\_connect ( string $username, string $password [, string $db [, string $charset [, int $session\_mode]]] ) )

I can't to set the charset to "AL32UTF8" (all my OracleXE uses this charset and my website is in UTF-8).

Best regards, Philippe
