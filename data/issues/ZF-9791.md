### Description

Hello,

It would be nice to be able to access to the current Zend\_Form object from any Zend\_Form\_Element or Zend\_Form\_Decorator (a getForm method...) I'm made some change into Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Description class to handle variables in a "sprintf style". Unfortunately I can get only the current element value and can't access to all form context :( ...

Sébastian, thought about implementing this too, because of the Notation handling when rendering names, i thought about setting the member $\_form when attaching an element or form to a existing form, \*but\* there is a drawback - s/o will try setting the $\_form member on an already attached element which then requires many actions to be proxied - resetting belongsTo, assurance that the name is not token within the new parent form, removing the element and all settings from the previous form, and so on ... I mean there is much to take care about, so that i am not willing at the moment to implement this, and i have something cooking, at that... ZF-9516 (be warned it is chaotic)
