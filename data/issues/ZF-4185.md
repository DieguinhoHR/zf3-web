ZF-4185: Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action ignores forwarded requests
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-04T03:42:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-04T04:47:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Action explicitly returns an empty string when the request has been forwarded or redirected. I can understand why a redierct would result in empty output, but I cannot understand why a forwarded request is also ignored.

In Zend/View/Helper/Action.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$this->request->isDispatched() || $this->response->isRedirect())  { 
      // forwards and redirects render nothing 
      return ''; 
    } 


I use the action helper to build componentized pages, and the issue I have now is that the component I'm wanting takes into account the status of Zend\_Auth. If the user is authenticated, then a form is rendered, otherwise a notice is rendered. Each outcome is handled by a different action in the controller, with another action to determine which should actually be called.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
      public function indexAction()
      {
        if (Zend_Auth::getInstance()->hasIdentity()) {
          $this->_forward('authenticated');
        } else {
          $this->_forward('not-authenticated');
        }
      }
      public function authenticatedAction()
      { /* render form */ }
      public function notAuthenticatedAction()
      { /* render notice */ }
    }


It's entirely possible there's a reason I can't see why forwarded requests should be ignored. This may be a FE rather than a Bug.

Besides writing another action helper, I can't see a workaround, so classed as major.

The assumption is that if your action forwards to another action, the content is incomplete. However, I can see your point as well, and am scheduling this change for the next mini release.

Actually, given your example, changing this would have no effect. The action() helper does not follow \_forward() requests, and this is by design. As a result, this means that what you are wanting to achieve simply wouldn't work anyways.

Additionally, the ViewRenderer does not render a view when a \_forward() request is detected -- which means you would need to manually inject your generated content into the response object.
