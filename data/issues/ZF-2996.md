### Description

I have an application which relies heavily on generating PDF reports. I have chosen domPDF for the task (which is excellent BTW). Since upgrading to 1.5.0 the changes to Zend\_Loader now seem to prevent use.

Example code to replicate issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    require_once 'DomPDF/dompdf_config.inc.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    spl_autoload_register('DOMPDF_autoload');
    
    $pdf = new DOMPDF();


With 1.0.4 this works without any issues. The domPDF gets loads and the class is usable from within my application. Since upgrading to 1.5.0 I now get the following errors:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Warning: Zend_Loader::include_once(DOMPDF.php) [function.Zend-Loader-include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\htdocs\ZendFramework\library\Zend\Loader.php on line 83

I use domPDF because I need to convert HTML to PDF. I accept the Zend\_Loader has changed but is there a way to switch off the new behavior to allow the use of external libs that do not necessarily conform to the strict guidelines in ZF?

Cheers,

- Robert

Hi,

How did you apply the patch? I am also receiving a similar error, which I think can be solved using this patch. Please help, regards, Current

@ current,

I think you issue is more with not have the Zend Framework specified in your PHP path.

e.g.

set\_include\_path(PS . '..' . DS . 'ZendFramework' . DS . 'library' . PS . '.' .DS . 'library' . PS . '.' .DS . 'application' . DS . 'models' . PS . get\_include\_path());

Hi,

Is there any chance that this tiny ickle patch could make it into 1.6.0? Pretty please :-)

Cheers, - Robert

Same problem here (ZF 1.6.2), this is my config:

bootstrap:

// Include path set\_include\_path( '.' . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '../library' . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '../library/classes'  
 . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '../library/functions'  
 . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '../library/plugins'  
 . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '/usr/local/lib/fw/php/phpzend-1.6.2/library' . PATH\_SEPARATOR . '/usr/local/lib/dompdf/dompdf-0.5.1'  
 . PATH\_SEPARATOR . get\_include\_path()  
 );

controller/action:

public function pdfAction() { // Include dompdf config file. require\_once( "dompdf\_config.inc.php" );

 
        // SPL register the DOMPDF loader so we can instantiate a new DOMPDF object.
        spl_autoload_register( "DOMPDF_autoload" );
    
       $objDomPdf = new DOMPDF();
    
       $objDomPdf->load_html( $strHtml );
    
       $objDomPdf->render();
    
       $objDomPdf->stream( "blah.pdf" );


}

And I got this warnings:

Warning: Zend\_Loader::include\_once(DOMPDF.php) [function.Zend-Loader-include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /usr/local/lib/fw/php/phpzend-1.6.2/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83
