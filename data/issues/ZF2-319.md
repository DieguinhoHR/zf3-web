### Description

In a multi index search, id are change with :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ($indexShift != 0) {
          foreach ($hits as $hit) {
                $hit->id += $indexShift;
          }
    }

but id must be document id, so when i use

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach($hits as $hit) {
            $document = $hit->getDocument();
    }


there are an error.

So, to fix that, i have submitted a PR with update unit test to cover this case. In Query\\Hit, id is a unique hit (no based on id document) and document\_id is the doc id. So, no confusion and multi search run good.
