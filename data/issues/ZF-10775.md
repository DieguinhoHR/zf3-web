I can't reproduce this with the official ZF 1.11.1 packages. My guess is that you have 1.11.0 on your include\_path, and it's being selected in precedence to the 1.11.1 library.

hmm... even when launching the script directly? \* udos@<a>X100e:/usr/local/lib/ZF/stable/1.11.1/bin</a>$ _./zf.sh show version_ Zend Framework Version: 1.11.0

Yes. In fact, I altered the script's last line to add the following the the PHP commandline to ensure I was only getting the ZF from the install:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    "$PHP_BIN" -d safe_mode=Off -d include_path=".:../library" -f "$PHP_DIR/zf.php" -- "$@"


which I then tested by "./zf.sh show phpinfo | less" to ensure the include\_path was as I set it. "./zf.sh show version" reports "Zend Framework Version: 1.11.1".

zf.sh does not explicitly set the include\_path, so if another version appears earlier on the include\_path, or the install is not on the include\_path at all, you will not see the appropriate version.

I'm embarrassed. the problem was indeed the include\_path in _.zf.ini_:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    php.include_path = "/usr/local/lib/ZF/stable/1.11.0/library:.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear:/usr/local/lib/zf-doctrine/library"


sorry about this...
