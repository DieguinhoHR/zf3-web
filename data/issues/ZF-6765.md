ZF-6765: Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_validateRule() iterates through provided fields when it's not necessary

### Description

Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_validateRule() has the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Evaluate the inputs against the validator chain.
     */
    if (count((array) $validatorRule[self::FIELDS]) > 1) {
        ....
    } else {
        $failed = false;
        foreach ($data as $fieldKey => $field) {
            ....
        }
        ....
    }


But $data cardinality is always less than (array) $validatorRule[self::FIELDS] cardinality since $data elements are collected by iterating through it.

It's not a bug, but it reduces code readability ($data is always one element array).
