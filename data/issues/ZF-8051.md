ZF-8051: Add toArray() to Zend\_View\_Abstract
----------------------------------------------

### Description

I think it'd be a good idea to add a method toArray() to Zend\_View\_Abstract basically duplicating the current getVars(), have getVars() proxy to toArray() and deprecate getVars(), so that getVars() can be removed as of ZF2.0.

This all to be more in line with other components.
