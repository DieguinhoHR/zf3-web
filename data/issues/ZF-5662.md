### Description

I'm using this adapter with MSSQL 2005. I use listTables() to make sure all the tables I need are in the database but I also have some views I need to check. There are quite of few things in sysobjects that may be needed by others. Adding a listDbobjects() method with a parameter to restrict by type would keep the code compact or adding a listViews() for just a list of views would be nice.

It seems like listing all the views would be almost as common as listing tables.

At this point this is not something that could easily be applied to all adapters.

If you'd like add the idea to the ZF 2.0 page on Zend\_Db
