### Description

I dont know how many rdbms allows NULL as a value for columns of composite keys, but in SQLite its allowed.

So, if I try to find a row with one column NULL it founds nothing.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    As I can see it looks for


but (at least in SQLite) it must be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    So I had a look at the source (lines 1174 to 1178):


 
                    $type = $this->_metadata[$keyNames[$keyPosition]]['DATA_TYPE'];
                    $columnName = $this->_db->quoteIdentifier($keyNames[$keyPosition], true);
                    $whereAndTerms[] = $this->_db->quoteInto(
                        $tableName . '.' . $columnName . ' = ?',
                        $keyValue, $type);```


The type is only retrieved from the DATA\_TYPE-metadata, but ignores the special situation, that the column allows NULL and the value is null.

Version is trunk Rev 16140

Do you have a nullable primary key here? What is the use case for SQL NULL in find?

Thats now a really long time ago and today I cant remember what I tried at that time. I cant imagine really useful use-cases nowadays. However, its possible at least in SQLite and I also can imagine, that there are use cases ;)

So, for me its not significant anymore.

Hello,

The bug still remains. A NULL field in a PK is possible on most databases but the method find() can't retrieve it for the reasons Sebastian gave.

The case we're having is a NULLable datetime field that is part of the composite PK.
