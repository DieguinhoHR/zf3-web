### Description

The Zend\_Rest\_Client (version 1.5.2) doesn't support CDATA in it's result, I just made a small change in the code so it works but was wondering if this might be fixed already or will be in the future?

The change: Add the LIBXML\_NOCDATA param to the simplexml\_load\_string() function in \\Rest\\Client\\Result.php.
