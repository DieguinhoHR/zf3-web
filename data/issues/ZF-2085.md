### Description

Using getName(), getShortName() or getSymbol() without a parameter throws an exception.

Reproduce Code:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    require_once 'Zend/Currency.php';
    $currency = new Zend_Currency('USD','Latn','de_AT');
    echo $currency->getShortName();


Output

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Currency_Exception' with message 'Locale 'de' is no valid locale' in 
    /Users/carsten/Sites/Zend/Currency.php:430 Stack trace: #0 /Users/carsten/Sites/Currency/3.php(5): 
    Zend_Currency::getShortName() #1 {main} thrown in /Users/carsten/Sites/Zend/Currency.php on line 430

Within Release 1.0.2 the mentioned methods are static.

You called the methods without giving a locale. Therefor the locale has been evaluated with automatical detection.

Your default locale is "de", which is a regionless locale and not useable for Zend\_Currency, as currencies are related to regions and not languages.

This is why you are getting this failure.

The mentioned API and behaviour has been changed after 1.0.2. You can download the latest trunk where the behaviour is like you expected it. Or you are using 1.0.2 and change your code to deliver a locale with region. But this API will be changed in the future.

If this get's integrated within 1.0.3 or 1.1 is actualy discussed within the dev-team.
