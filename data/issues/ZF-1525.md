ZF-1525: Header set in Zend\_Http\_Client indicating x-http-method-override is not removed for subsequent requests

### Description

When a PUT or DELETE operation is performed and Zend\_Gdata\_App::\_httpMethodOverride is set to 'true', a header called x-http-method-override is added to the Zend\_Http\_Client object being used to indicate that, even though a POST operation is being performed, a PUT or DELETE should be performed instead.

However, for subsequent requests, the header remains set in the client. Thus, performing a POST to insert a new entry will also include a x-http-method-override header based upon the last set value.

Along with calling Zend\_Http\_Client::resetParameters() with each HTTP operation, any x-http-method-override headers set int he client should be removed.

Removed x-http-method-override header along with each call to resetParameters, to prevent it from being improperly included in requests which shouldn't have it
