ZF-4367: Controller Dispatcher - Standard and Interface dispatch() @return
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-24T05:21:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-11-07T20:47:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Controller Dispatcher Interface states that @return should be @return Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract|boolean, but the Standard implementation returns nothing of both. Since the Front controller does not check for the dispatch() response it should be changed to @return void in both classes to stop confusion.
