### Description

I have noticed in your documentation that all code does not tell the user where to put it, If you could setup a default MVC layout and a regular layout and then have a little div in the top that says where the code should be put if the layouts differ, kind of like a little red box and description next to it pointing to where the code should be placed. I'm tired of telling people.
