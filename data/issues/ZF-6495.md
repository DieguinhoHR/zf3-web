ZF-6495: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract does not load rowClass with respect to namespaces

### Description

The following uses [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader-resource.html#zend.loader.autoloader-resource.reference)

There is no specific instructions on where custom Row/Rowset classes belong, perhaps concrete autoloader resouces could define DbTableRow/DbTableRowset folders parallel to the current DbTable folder.

Regardless of that, considering a custom rowset file is placed in the DbTable folder and the Class is named as such: Default\_Model\_DbTable\_FooRow This will not load correctly since Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract just uses a loadClass call to include the custom class.

Removing Zend\_Loader::loadClass($this->\_rowClass); at line 119 in file Zend/Db/Table/Rowset/Abstract.php correctly loads the file

There doesn't seem to be a way to work around this without manually editing the include\_path
