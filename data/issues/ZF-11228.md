@Matthijn, What do you like better about Zend\_Db\_Table::find()?

The earlier versions did not always gave a rowset back when it was not needed, now it always does. Added a screenshot of code to help clarify what I mean. (Somehow the code in my message is all messed up).

When you pass an array in the find method find(array(1,2,3)) it should return a rowset, not when you just put one value find(1) in it, it should return a row instead. Since it is a primary key in the database find does it search on. So with a single value it will give just one result back. - It always returns a rowset however.
