### Description

Not sure if this is a bug, new feature or improvement...

I have come across an incompatibility that the Soap Server has with the .NET Soap Client. When loading a WSDL generated by Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscover as a Web Reference in Visual Studio, if there are no objects/complex types in the WSDL signature, then that WSDL is not loaded successfully. I found that the problem is when "types" tag and "xsd:schema" tag, inside that, is missing from the WSDL. It must be there and empty at the least:

I found that putting a call to $this->addSchemaTypeSection(); in the Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl::\_\_construct() fixed this.

Is this seen as a bug in Visual Studio or is it a shortcoming of Zend\_Soap\_Autodiscover and Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl? And either way should there not be a work around to ensure compatibility with .NET?

In our company we have to be sure that our web services are consumable (and easy to use) by .NET clients. For now my work around will be to have a dummy method that has an object as a parameter, though this is not optimal.
