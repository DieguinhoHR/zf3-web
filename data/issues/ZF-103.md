### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/103>

Not all PHP installations have PDO support.

However, if available, the PDO adapter for MySQL should be used, since it offers better performance, the benefits of true prepared queries (no emulation required), and has more stable code than the MySQLi adapter.

I think the MySQLi adapter should be moved to the incubator. Significant work needs to be done on it, before it is ready for use.

All agreed. MySQLi adapter moves to incubator for 0.1.5 release.

PHP PDO code has proven to be no more reliable than mysqli driver in practice.

Note that "mysqli driver" is the not the same thing as ZF's mysqli adapter.
