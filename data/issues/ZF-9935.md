ZF-9935: Same cache in Zend\_Paginator for different items
----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In release 1.10.5 the following code in Zend\_Paginator was changed:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return md5(serialize($this->getAdapter()) . $this->getItemCountPerPage());


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return md5(serialize(array(
           get_class($this->getAdapter()),
           $this->getItemCountPerPage()
    )));


This assumes that a Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter class is used only once in the whole application. I'm using a modified version of the DbSelect adapter so that the adapter is loaded with different Zend\_Db\_Select objects. But with the current caching implementation, this always leads to the same cache id because only the class name and the item counter are serialized which are the same for all objects.

Ok, I didn't check the actual source code. Thanks for the fix.
