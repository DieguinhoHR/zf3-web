### Description

Possible be better to mark started application resources before it initialization.

Because happens situation when used "modules" resource and one of bootstrap try to load resource "modules" and broker try to init it once more with current bootstrap as application instance, before resource "modules" would marked like already is run.

My suggestions to move marking like before resource initialization: Zend\\Application\\AbstractBootstrap method \_executeResource()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $broker->markRun($resourceName);
    $return = $plugin->init();
