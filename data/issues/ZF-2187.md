### Description

This error occurs only on i5/OS (both OS version v5R3 and v5R4) and didn't occur on Windows or Linux.

I ran AllTests.php on i5 with ZendCore 2.5.0 and bundled ZendFramework 1.02. When it got to the "Zend\_Mail\_InterfaceTest" I got segmentation fault crash. I guess it's on the test that wasn't in the report (I ran the tests with --log-tap), which is "testIterationWithSeek". Below you can find the report on the last test suite.

Plz check the mail function on the i5 machine. It's probably the mail() function that raise this error (as far as i checked, the mail function doesn't work properly on the i5 machine).

I don't have i5/OS, so I need a little help. The test you mentioned uses the LimitIterator. Does this crash? What's the output?

 <?php var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_); $array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_); $a = new ArrayIterator($array); var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_); $l = new LimitIterator($a, 2, 2); var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_); foreach ($l as $k => $v) { var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_, $k, $v); } var\_dump(\_\_LINE\_\_); ?>

Note: it should be ```` with two underscores before and after LINE
