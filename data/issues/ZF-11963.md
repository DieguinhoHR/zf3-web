### Description

Just found this in ZF 1.11.1 Zend\_Translation\_Adapter::addTranslation() supposed to scan directories for translation files amongst other things, Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 248:

 
             $iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
                new RecursiveRegexIterator(
                    new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($options['content'], RecursiveDirectoryIterator::KEY_AS_PATHNAME),
                    '/^(?!.*(\.svn|\.cvs)).*$/', RecursiveRegexIterator::MATCH
                ),
                RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST
            );


The regex excludes any directories with .svn or .cvs in it's path like /home/user/dev/project.svn/translations, not just .../.svn/... (and .cvs doesn't even exist, CVS' directories are named CVS)...

The mentioned BC was introduced by ZF-11546.

A revert of this BC was not accepted by the person who worked on ZF-11546. A working solution can be found within [ZF2-259](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/259) and was denied to be backported.

Therefor reassigning.

Is there still an issue with the code introduced in ZF-11546? If so, is it something that should be reverted for 1.12?
