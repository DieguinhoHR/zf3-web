ZF-8955: Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader::setIncludeFileCache() does unnecessary disk stats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Performance Improvement Created: 2010-01-27T09:23:32.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:31.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

In the setIncludeFileCache() method, the dirname() and file\_exists() calls are done multiple times on the same targets. This raises the number of actually required disk stats and can be simply optimized.
