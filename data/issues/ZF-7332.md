### Description

in Zend/Locale/Format.php line 337 an iconv function is used but it's never checked if the extension is loaded (like many other parts of the framework do), you should the "extension\_loaded" check like in Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php line 96

iconv is a default extension for all php versions. This means it is always available as long as it is not erased manually.

The whole I18n core does not work when iconv is not available. This is noted in the manual and also the requirements.

Personally I am against such a change because of performance. I will check with the dev-team.

iconv is available in a vanilla PHP installation; you have to pass a switch at compile time to _disable_ it. As such, it was decided some time ago that we would do no checks for this particular extension.

(The DB adapters are different in this regard as most of the DB adapters must be explicitly enabled at compile time, and will availability will differ between installations.)
