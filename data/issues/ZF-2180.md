I concur with this report.

"If a class name is comprised of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be capitalized. Successive capitalized letters are not allowed, e.g. a class "Zend\_PDF" is not allowed while "Zend\_Pdf" is acceptable."

Because method names in PHP are not case sensitive I assume it's safe to fix this issue for next minor release without compromising BC compatibility.
