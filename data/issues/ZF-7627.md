### Description

The localized format for Zend\_Date in pl\_PL has changed from yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss to dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss. Altought it is a correct format for the localization it's not compatible with MySQL datetime field witch now doesn't accept the velues generated by Zend\_Date.

When you want to store a date in a database then use the correct date format.

Localized formats are "localized" and not intended to be stored into a DB datefield. Look into Zend\_Filter\_LocalizedToNormalized or into your DB how to handle localized dates.

Closing as non issue.
