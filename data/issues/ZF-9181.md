ZF-9181: Wrong condition in Zend\_Currency constructor makes the whole component unusable

### Description

In our project, we're using Zend\_Currency to handle prices, but so far, we've been unable to make it work. Even the simplest example from the documentation throws an error:

This one works: {quote} new Zend\_Currency( array('value' => 100) ); {quote}

This one fails: {quote} new Zend\_Currency( array('value' => 100.50) ); {quote}

Type: Zend\_Cache\_Exception Message: Invalid id or tag 'Zend\_LocaleC\_fr\_FR\_currencytoname\_100.5' : must use only [a-zA-Z0-9\_]

As soon as we're using anything else than an integer, it fails. Zend\_Currency tries to cache something under a wrong cache identifier because of a single malformed condition in the Zend\_Currency constructor:

The line 103: if (!isset($options['currency']) || !is\_array($options)) {

Should read: if (!isset($this->\_options['currency']) || !is\_array($options)) {

In Zend\_Currency::setLocale() just above (line 101), the 'currency' option is set by default if missing, this makes the whole following condition pass although it should not. Moreover, this does not seem correct that Zend\_Currency puts the value of the currency (100.50) in the 'currency' option, there could be another problem somewhere.
