### Description

These methods may be simple, but would be helpful:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function earlierThan(Zend_Date $date)
    {
        return $date->getTimestamp() > $this->getTimestamp();
    }
    
    public function laterThan(Zend_Date $date)
    {
        return $this->getTimestamp() > $date->getTimestamp();
    }

You could just do

// $newdate earlier if ($date->compare($newdate) < 0) then { }

// $newdate later if ($date->compare($newdate) > 0) then { }

Is it really nessecary to have another function for this ??

Well, currently I can't because of [ZF-653] IIRC, but these methods are just more readable (self-documenting) ways of saying the same thing.
