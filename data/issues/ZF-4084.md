### Description

When using Zend\_Translate to parse xliff files (generated through translate-toolkit: po2xliff), I end up with the following notice error: **Notice**: Undefined index: target-language in **/home/remy/my\_php/ZendFramework-1.5.3/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter/Xliff.php** on line **119**

I've looked at Oasis xliff 1.2 specification to check if "target-language" attribute of "file" node is mandatory, but it appears it's optional (cf. [http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/â€¦](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#file)) Line 119 in Zend/Translate/Adapter/Xliff.php "$this->\_target = $attrib['target-language'];" could be replaced by "$this->\_target = array\_key\_exists('target-language', $attrib) ? $attrib['target-language'] : null;"

Regards, Remy

Sorry, but the actual implementation of Xliff for Zend\_Translate

\*) is based on Xliff 1.1 \*) must have a target-language even if it's optional

This is not a bug but a feature request.
