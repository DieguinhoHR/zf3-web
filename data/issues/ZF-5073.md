You can mark individual elements to ignore already by setting their "ignore" flag to true. This is not quite the same behavior, but is the preferred way to indicate that a value should not be returned.

I'm reluctant to honor this request as the idea behind Zend\_Form is to return a set of values; if some values are empty, this is perfectly valid. I would recommend instead that you extend Zend\_Form locally and add a getPopulatedValues() method or override the getValues() method to get the behavior you desire.

**_as the idea behind Zend\_Form is to return a set of values; if some values are empty, this is perfectly valid_** is ok but if use this code(with optionally fields on form): $table->insert(($form->getValues()); work partially: if the Db coloum is a text data-type no problem (save a empty string) but is a date data-type not work because don't accept to save an empty string to this data-type (with mysql). i'm have resolved using array\_filter() function but I think it would be useful an automatic filter or using a null value for empty result.

I'd recommend adding a filter to such elements that provide a default, correct value when the value is empty.
