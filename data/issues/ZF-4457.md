ZF-4457: "Specialized" misspellings in RecurrenceException
----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-02T15:04:41.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-16T06:56:02.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.2 (13/Oct/08)

### Description

In Zend\_Gdata\_Extension\_RecurrenceException

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    RecurrenceException.php Line 140:
        public function getSpecialzied()
        {
            return $this->_specizlied;
        }


Here the function name is misspelled, and it returns a further misspelled protected var. The actual protected var is $\_specialized (spelled correctly), so this function will always fail.

further down...

RecurrenceException.php Line 151:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setSpecizlied($value)
        {
            $this->_specialized = $value;
            return $this;
        }


This function name is spelled incorrectly (but returns the correct protected variable). This function works, but correcting this error may break existing clients that are using the incorrect spelling.

Not merged into release-1.6 branch. So it should be marked as "fixed for 1.7 Preview release" or to be merged into release-1.6
