### Description

Hi,

The Api documentation:

Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle headTitle ([string $title = null], [string $setType = Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract::APPEND], string $separator)

The comments above the function: /\*\* \* Retrieve placeholder for title element and optionally set state \* \* @param string $title \* @param string $setType \* @param string $separator \* @return Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadTitle \*/

The function:

public function headTitle($title = null, $setType = Zend\_View\_Helper\_Placeholder\_Container\_Abstract::APPEND)

So, as you can see the function params doesn't match with documentation and comments params.

As far as i checked there are no ways to actually set the separator...

For the later part, about setting the separator i was wrong, this can be done by setSeparator...

I've uploaded a patch which removes "@param string $separator" from the docblock.

This should bring the API documentation for the headTitle() method inline with the method's current signature.
