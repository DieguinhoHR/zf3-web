ZF-1446: invalid controller name used to determine view path when using special characters in URL

### Description

When trying to reach controller "TwoWords" controller, index action and let ViewRenderer choose the view there could be a problem.

let's me explain by example :

/twowords/index => OK (controller reached, twowords/index.phtml view found) /two-words/index => problem (controller found =>twowords, but trying to get two-words/index.phtml view script which does not exists)

As for controllers there is the ability to reserve some keywords like (+ or - or whatever you have set) to compute better url, and preserve correct controller name (without any + or -), this behaviour should be the same for views as there is no sense to have duplicate views to render same things.

Assign to Matthew.

The current functionality is such that any word or path delimiter found in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Standard will be substituted with a dash ('-') by the ViewRenderer. Thus, the URI /two-words/index will call TwoWordsController::indexAction() and render the view script two-words/index.phtml. This is to be internally consistent with how the controller and action names are passed via the request object.

At most, a documentation issue, though the documentation notes as I have in the comment to this issue.

I've updated the documentation in r5304 to better indicate the process.
