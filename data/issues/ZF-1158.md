### Description

Section 9.2 of the Zend\_Framework manual, in the example code underneath subsection heading, "Examples of specifying no columns", the code sample reads:

 <?php // Build this query: // SELECT p."product\_id", p."product\_name" // FROM "products" AS p JOIN "line\_items" AS l // ON p.product\_id = l.product\_id $select = $db->select() ->from(array('p' => 'products'), array('product\_id', 'product\_name')) ->join(array('l' => 'line\_items'), 'p.product\_id = l.product\_id' array() ); // empty list of columns ?> It should have a comma after the 'p.product\_id = l.product\_id' stanza. Perhaps, also trivial, bolding the 'array()' notation would also facilitate understanding of this 'empty array' concept to new users.

Thank you.

Fixed in revision 4258.

Unfortunately, DocBook XML does not permit words inside code samples to be bold. So I have written a brief paragraph following the code sample, calling attention to the usage of an empty array().

Add Zend\_Db\_Select to components.
