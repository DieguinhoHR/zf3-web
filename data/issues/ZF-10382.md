### Description

Currently using ZF 10.0, I came across a problem while using Zend\_Validate\_Dd: I work with utf8 values in form and in databases. During the validation with NoRecordExist including accents(é, ê, ...), this generates an error. Maybe addind an option to constructor for utf8 values would be a good idea ? Meanwhile i've added this line in \_query methode.

Do you have set your DB connection to use UTF-8?
