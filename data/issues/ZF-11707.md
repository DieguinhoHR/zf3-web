ZF-11707: Disabling input type="file" in a form causes zend\_file\_transfer\_adapter\_http::isValid to enter workaround block of code and returning false (not validating)

### Description

In Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::isValid() there is a block with comment: "// Workaround for a PHP error returning empty $\_FILES when form data exceeds php settings" This workaround is executed not only when form data exceeds php settings, but also when you submit a form with 1 disabled file element and other non file element.

The condition for entering workarund should also check if sttings were exceeded.

This bug is somewhat connected to: #ZF-10279.

After submitting a form with a single file element which is not required and disabled, and other, non file elements, $\_FILES is an empty array. Having empty array in $\_FILES, Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::\_prepareFiles() produces empty array in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::\_files.

Since $\_POST is not empty (because of other, non file form elements), condition: "if (empty($this->\_files) && ($content > 0)) {" is true in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::isValid(), and isValid returns false.

Zend\_File does not know about Zend\_Form\_Element. When Zend\_Form says that there is an file element which has to be validated Zend\_File tries to validate it (as it is called by Zend\_Form).

My expectation is that validations should NOT BE PROCESSED/DONE for disabled elements. Therefor I don't see this as failure from Zend\_File but from Zend\_Form which should not try to validate an disabled element.

Please give an example of your problem. How do you disable a special input type?

Fixed with [GH-388](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/388)

Is this problem really solved in 1.x version?

I'm trying to submit form with disabled file field & still get errors using latest (1.11.11) ZF version.

My Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
            
    $form->setMethod('POST')
      ->setEnctype(Zend_Form::ENCTYPE_MULTIPART);
            
    $title = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('title');
    $title->setLabel('Title')
      ->setRequired();
    $form->addElement($title);
            
    $file = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
    $file->setLabel('File')
      ->setAttrib('disabled', true)
      ->setValueDisabled(true);
    $form->addElement($file);
            
    $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
    $submit->setLabel('Submit');
    $form->addElement($submit);


When trying to validate form I get error: 'fileUploadErrorIniSize' => string 'File 'file' exceeds the defined ini size'

Fix needs to be backported from ZF2

You can use this simple workaround before calling isValid():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(!isset($_FILES[$form_element_name])) {
        $_FILES[$form_element_name] = array(
                      'name' => '',
                      'type' => '',
                      'tmp_name' => '',
                      'error' => 4,
                      'size' => 0);
    }

this is not work for me the post data $this->getRequest()->getPost() return: array 'exam' => array 'exam\_id' => string '' (length=0) 'exam\_dates\_id' => string '' (length=0) 'disability' => string '0' (length=1) 'save' => string 'Save and continue' (length=17) 'MAX\_FILE\_SIZE' => string '8388608' (length=7) but var\_dump($\_FILES); return empty !
