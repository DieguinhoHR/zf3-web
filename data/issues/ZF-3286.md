### Description

Actualy I'm not sure if this is bug or feature, but I'd expect all elements extending Zend\_Form\_Element\_Multi to work as enums.

Having this element:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = new Zend_Form_Element_Select('name');
    $element->addMultiOption('foo', "FOO");
    $element->addMultiOption('bar', "BAR");


Expected behaviour:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->isValid('foo'); // returns true
    $element->getValue();     // returns "foo"


But I was a bit surprised that a value which is unlisted can be accepted and returned:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->isValid('unlisted-value'); // returns true
    $element->getValue(); // returns "unlisted-value"


I know this can be solved by adding InArray validator. But I would expect it's (probably the main) purpose and default behaviour of these elements not to let through _unavailable options_. If this behaviour is realy so intended, I think there should be at least warning in manual that it's upon to developer to provide the check manually. This relates to Select, MultiSelect, MultiCheckbox and Radio elements.

Behavior added to trunk and 1.6 release branch. New flag, 'registerInArrayValidator' allows you to disable the functionality as desired.

Also did the same for the Dojo form elements.
