ZF-1177: Multiple requests produce unexpected results due to persistent HTTP client GET parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-03-30T14:57:18.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.2 (06/Apr/07)

### Description

Zend\_Service\_Flickr uses Zend\_Rest\_Client, which, in turn, uses Zend\_Http\_Client. Zend\_Http\_Client maintains GET parameters assigned to it by design. This design decision propagates to Zend\_Rest\_Client, which also defers resetting HTTP client GET data to userland. By reason of these facts and because Zend\_Service\_Flickr does not reset the HTTP client parameters, Zend\_Service\_Flickr may produce unexpected results when calling multiple methods that utilize Flickr REST web services.

By resetting the HTTP client parameters before a restGet() invocation, such unexpected results are avoided:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $restClient = $this->getRestClient();
    $restClient->getHttpClient()->resetParameters();
    $response = $restClient->restGet('/services/rest/', $options);
