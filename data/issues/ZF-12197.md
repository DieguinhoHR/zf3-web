ZF-12197: Zend\_Locale\_FormatTest::testIsFloat fails in localized environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Unit Tests: Problem Created: 2012-05-10T19:26:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-10T19:27:46.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

My locale is set to cs\_CZ. This is causing Zend\_Locale\_FormatTest::testIsFloat to fail on:

$this->assertTrue(Zend\_Locale\_Format::isFloat('123.345'));

because in cz\_CZ the decimal separator is ",".

Tests pass when setlocale(LC\_ALL, 'en\_US') is preceded before this assert call.
