### Description

I just updated from the svn and the application stopped working.

The method getFieldInfos() was removed in r6314 from Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php, but the method is called from Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentMerger.php (line 146).

I can't assume it's a bug, but as far as my application is concerned, restoring the method solved part of the problem.

Don't need to be merged anywhere. The problem appears in trunk branch of SVN and fixed there.
