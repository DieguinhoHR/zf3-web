ZF-9548: Locale exists but is not in list
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-26T13:38:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-03-26T15:23:44.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.3 (01/Apr/10)

### Description

The Zend/Locale/Data/ directory contains a number of codeset variants, such as sr\_Latn.xml. (Serbian is by default cyrillic).

(1) These variants cannot be used as they are not listed in Zend\_Locale::$\_localeData[]

(2) I am reliably informed ([http://openi18n.org/docs/text/â€¦](http://www.openi18n.org/docs/text/LocNameGuide-V10.txt)) that the correct naming convention for these locales is "sr@latin"

To fix this, I propose

(a) these codeset variants are added to the array

(b) Zend\_Locale accepts @latin, @cyrillic, etc. as synonyms for \_Latn, \_Cyrl, etc.

When you add a issue then you should also provide a reproducable usecase.

Actually all informations are degraded when they can not be detected. In this case it means that "sr\_Latn" would be degraded to "sr".

You should also note that "codesets" are not part of the "language-region" definition which is needed for Zend\_Locale.

There is no component within ZF which would accept codesets until now.

Sorry - I thought the reproduce case was sufficiently trivial.

$x=new Zend\_Locale('sr'); // gives 'sr' - serbian in cyrillic

$x=new Zend\_Locale('sr\_Latn'); // also gives the cyrillic 'sr' - it should give the latin variant.

The locale sr\_Latn.xml exists in the CLDR, and has been imported into /Zend/Locale/Data.

Once again: Codesets are not supported by ZF.

There are several other informations available within CLDR which are NOT integrated within ZF. Codesets are just one of this informations.

Closing as non-issue
