### Description

Now that Zend\_Controller has an AutoComplete helper with several flavors, form elements should be created to facilitate adding autocompletion at the form level. For example, with a dojo autocompleter, it might:

- allow specifying the name of the dojo.data store to use with the element
- load the necessary dojo libraries
- add the appropriate dojo attributes to the element itself

Similar functionality could be added to the other styles supported with the AutoComplete action helper.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Zend\_Dojo has FilteringSelect and ComboBox elements, and the new ZendX\_JQuery component does similarly; this is a moot issue at this point.

Is this feature still on the todo list? Autocompletion at form level seems only logical..
