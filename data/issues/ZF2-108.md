ZF2-108: SetCookie::getFieldValue() always uses urlencode() for cookie values, even in case they are already encoded
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-12-05T01:06:31.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:15:37.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

In the following line:

$fieldValue = $this->getName() . '=' . urlencode($this->getValue());

SetCookie::getFieldValue() ignores the fact that cookies may come already encoded (for example from responses). As a result they are double encoded in this method and become invalid.
