### Description

The Firebird/Interbase adapter, developed by [~kgbfernando], is claimed as complete and ready for review and promotion from the incubator. Unit tests must cover at least 80% of the code (by LOC), documentation must exist, and coding standards compliance should be assured before promotion.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
