Reopened issue

This was a notification for myself. The added section is a duplicate from Zend\_Validate (which I wrote). Needs to be validated and rewritten.

modificaions to chapter for Zend\_Filter\_Alpha and also got rid of a problem still being reported by the doc checker in Zend\_Filter\_BaseName doc.
