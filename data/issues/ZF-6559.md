### Description

File: Zend/Auth/Adapter/DbTable.php Line: 412

Why do you catch an Exception and throw it with another message? I've spent an hour figuring out why "the supplied parameter (...) failed (...)". When I went deeper, I found out that it is PDOException that holds a message: "permission denied to relation (...)".

I think that exceptions in Zend Framework should be for developers and should provide maximum information about the state of an application.

Within ZF 1.10 the thrown exception contains the previous exception. To display it simply print the exception or call $exception->getPrevious()
