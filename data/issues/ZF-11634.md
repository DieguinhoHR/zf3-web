### Description

IE 6 doesn't support addEventListener() javascript method which is used in Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Captcha\_ReCaptcha. I think you should use attachEvent() in case of IE ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/…](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener))

Updated priority to Blocker since it makes the component a bit useless ;). Will fix soon using a conditional check possibly.
