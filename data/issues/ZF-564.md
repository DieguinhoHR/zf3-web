### Description

As reported by Waldemar Schott on fw-general:

I think it would be nice if Zend\_Mail supports fluent interfaces like other parts of the framework.

$mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $mail->setBodyText('This is the text of the mail.') ->setFrom('somebody@example.com', 'Some Sender') ->addTo('somebody\_else@example.com', 'Some Recipient') ->setSubject('TestSubject') ->send();|
