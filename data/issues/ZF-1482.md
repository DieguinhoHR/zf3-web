### Description

The gettext adpater doesn't work on 64 bit computer. When we try to use translation file we see that kind of errors: '/var/www/html/usvn/locale/fr\_FR/messages.mo' is not a gettext file.

I wrote a fix:

    -        if (dechex($input[1]) == "950412de") {
    +        if (substr(dechex($input[1]), -8) == "950412de") {
                 $this->_bigEndian = FALSE;
             } else if (dechex($input[1]) == "de120495") {
                 $this->_bigEndian = TRUE;


I think that gettext adpter should not work on Big Endian 64 bit computer but i'm not sure.

When PHP does not act as described in the documentation also for 64bit machines we have a problem.

Actually the first 4 bytes from the file are read by the gettext adapter. This must always be the same for 32 and 64bit machines. See line 65/67

Then with unpack the input is converted to a long with 'V' or 'N'. Documentation states that 'V' and 'N' always return 32bit even on 64bit machines.

As you describe it, your problem would mean that we do not get 32bit but a 64bit long value.

But this could also mean that the adapter itself can not work on 64bit machines. Have you created the mo file on a 64bit machine or on a 32bit machine ??

Can you attach your mo file so we can check the mo file ?

Can you verify if the translations are working with your changed code ?

We will wait for your response.

Yes get a 64 bit value like this: fffffffffffff950412de

Read the comment on: <http://php.net/dechex>

I join my .mo file

I have not check if translation in deep but my unit test work. The test check if a particular string is translate into french.

Actually what you sent was not the mo file...

Please check out the latest SVN 5108 or later. Issue should be fixed now for 64bit machines.

Sorry for .po

I send the .mo

I will test the latest svn version tomorrow.

I know this is a very old issue, but I'm experiencing the same error using apache2 under an Ubuntu64bits machine (AMD64).

[Thu May 31 11:48:10 2012] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Translate\_Exception' with message ''[http://localhost/TeleMarcom/TeleMarcomPartners/…](http://localhost/TeleMarcom/TeleMarcomPartners/locale/es_ES.mo)' is not a gettext file'

I was moving from gettext since it randomly failed while reloading multiple divs at a time using jQuery, returning untranslated or mistranslated strings (see this post [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10508305/…](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10508305/gettext-works-sometime)). Gettext could successfully find and use my .mo files, but Zend\_translator keeps insisting saying my files are not .mo

I wonder if this could be related to this thread. THe zend version I'm using is:

Versión: 1.11.11-0ubuntu1
