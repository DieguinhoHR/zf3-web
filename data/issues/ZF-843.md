### Description

Cal Evans (cal@calevans.com) writes:

I'm working with getopt and I'm running into an issue. If I fire getOption() with an invalid key, it returns null like it should but it throws a notice:

Notice: Undefined index: module in /home/devzone/zendlib/incubator/library/Zend/Console/Getopt.php on line 520

Line 520:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $flag = $this->_ruleMap[$flag];


If you change that to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $flag = @$this->_ruleMap[$flag];


Then the notice goes away. However, I'm not sure of the ramifications of that. Everything SEEMS to work just fine.

Also, just a nit-pick here. (on a beautiful piece of code) the docbloc for getOption lists the parameter as $key but the actual function says $flag.
