ZF-11163: Zend\_Uri\_Http should ignore port number if it is the default for the current scheme.

### Description

I ran into this testing my code using both Zend\_Uri\_Http and Zend\_Http\_Client. Since the client mutates the argument, setting the port to a default port (See ZF-11162), it was hard for me to assert equality between expected URI's and actual URI's in my unit test.

Imho, it would be nicer if Zend\_Uri\_Http ignores the port number in the constructed string URL if it is the default for the current scheme. See the provided patch and unit test.

Maybe there should be an option 'ignoreDefaultPorts' or an argument for the getUri() method, I'm not sure.
