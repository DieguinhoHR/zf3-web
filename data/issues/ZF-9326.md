ZF-9326: Incorrect arguments handling
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-03-04T06:08:26.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:55.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Problem in method Zend\_Rest\_Client::\_\_call($method, $args).

Method get($path, $query) was called with some $path value and $query = array('key1'=>'keyValue1', 'key2'=>'keyValue2');

It is expected that the \_\_call() method will call restGet() method with correct arguments, but it not happen.

It is caused by that the argument $query is not correctly processed:

// $this->\_data == array(); TRUE $this->\_data['rest'] = 1; // $this->\_data == array('rest' => 1); TRUE $data = array\_slice($args, 1) + $this->\_data; /\* $data == array( 'rest' => 1, 0 => array( 'key1' => 'keyValue1', 'key2' => 'keyValue2') ); TRUE \*/ And on exit we having query eq ?rest=1&0=Array
