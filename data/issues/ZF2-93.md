### Description

The most problem of all PDF creators is i18n. For arabic and persian languages we need two feature. \* Right to left (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left>) \*\* "سلام بر شما ای دوستان." {color:red}Dot character must be the left position of sentence. This page is Left to right also in PDF.{color} \* Joined characters \*\* "سلام" {color:green}correct{color} \*\* "س‌ل‌ا‌م" {color:red}wrong{color}

This two may help Zend i18n more feature. Thanks. Useful : <http://www.tcpdf.org/> Persian and Arabic language on RTL document in TCPDF: [http://www.tcpdf.org/examples/example\_018.pdf](http://www.tcpdf.org/examples/example_018.pdf)

The PDF component will be completly rewritten, so the issue won't be fixed in the old component.
