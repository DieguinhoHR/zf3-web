ZF-562: Recource by reference
-----------------------------

### Description

If you want to pass the '$source' parameter in \_\_construct() by reference you need to add the '&' operator by assigning the variable at line 42:

- old $this->\_source = $source;
- new $this->\_source = & $source;

Best regards wego

Scheduling this to be fixed as of ZF 0.9.0.

We're using PHP 5. This behavior has changed.

Sorry, I think I misunderstood you. Try this code - I think it will help:

 <?php $foo = 'bar'; $baz = &$foo; $foo = NULL; var\_dump($baz); ?> Hope that helps.
