Please provide some more information on what you do (code snippet to reproduce the behavior). It's aso important to get some more info on which LDAP server you're using and what's really happening on the server (server log files),

Generally it's highly doubtable that Zend\_Ldap is doing something wrong here as it's not able to bind you to an LDAP server with wrong credentials given that the server is configured correctly.
