ZF-8192: Zend\_Config\_Xml encoding problem (utf-8 vs. iso-8859-1)

### Description

I'm not sure if this is an issue of Zend\_Config, Zend\_Config\_Xml, the core parser itself or whatever is under the hood of those components. Here's the case:

I have a xml config file, which I used with Zend\_Navigator to display a website menu. The file is encoded with ISO-8859-1 on the disk, and the headers inside the file say: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

In my bootstrap, I have:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    protected function _initNavigation() {
        $registry = Zend_Registry::getInstance();
        $layout = $registry->get('Zend_Layout');
        $view = $layout->getView();
        $config = new Zend_Config_Xml(APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/navigation.xml', 'nav');
        $navigation = new Zend_Navigation($config);
        $view->navigation($navigation);
    }


So far so good. When I tell my layout renderer to display the menu, with

 
    <pre class="literal">
    echo $this->navigation()->menu();


I get garbled accents, i.e. "InÃcio" instead of "Início".

Content-Type headers are being sent out to tell the browser we're using ISO-8859-1:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1'); ?>
    ...


If I change browser encoding to UTF-8, it displays right.

So far I've been using utf8\_decode() to fix it. I believe there's something wrong with the XML parser.

I'd be interested to know if you are still having problems and whether it turned out to be an issue with Zend\_Config\_Xml.

As far as I can tell this is really not an issue with Zend\_Config\_Xml exactly. It's a feature of SimpleXML to only return output as UTF-8 strings.

But it would be really nice if we could set an option in Zend\_Config\_Xml to get the configuration array output as iso-8859-1 by setting an attribute on the config object or so.

You only need to put utf8\_decode($value) in two places (lines 201 and 275) on the Zend\_Config\_Xml-class if "output = iso-8859-1" has been set somewhere, otherwise it should work as it does now.
