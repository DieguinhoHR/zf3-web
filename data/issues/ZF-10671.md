### Description

Per documentation at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html)

"If $content is present and not a boolean FALSE, then that content is rendered within the start and close form tags; if $content is a boolean FALSE (the default), only the opening form tag is generated."

This works fine for the standard form view helper but when Dojo is enabled $content is set to '' which prevents only the opening tag from being created. The culprit is in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Form.php in function form($id, $attribs = null, $content = false).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (false === $content) {
                $content = '';
            }
