### Description

Seems that the 'lb\_LU' locale is not available in the Zend Framework. Luxembourgish (lb) is an official language in Luxembourgh (LU), as mentioned on the CLDR charts: [http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/â€¦](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_territory_information.html)

The actual used CLDR release within ZF does not include this language.

As soon as ZF integrates a newer CLDR release this locale will be added automatically. Therefor closing this issue actually as won't fix.

PS: Actually CLDR 1.9 is planned for 10.Nov. As soon as it is released it will be integrated within ZF.
