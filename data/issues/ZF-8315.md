ZF-8315: ViewScript form decorator does not support $module parameter for Partial view helper
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2009-11-16T11:39:58.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-22T08:21:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): 
 Reporter:  Konr Ness (konrness)  Assignee:  Ryan Mauger (bittarman)  Tags: - Zend\_Form
 
 Related issues: - [ZF-10474](/issues/browse/ZF-10474)
- [ZF-9927](/issues/browse/ZF-9927)
 
 Attachments: - [ViewScript.diff](/issues/secure/attachment/13284/ViewScript.diff)
 
### Description

When Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_ViewScript renders the view, it uses Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial, which supports two parameter formats.

The one that is supported is: $view->partial($name, $model)

The one that is NOT supported is: $view->partial($name, $module, $model)

Without this functionality, it is impossible to render a view script from a module other than current module.

Will submit a BC patch soon.

Not sure exactly when this was resolved, but the option 'viewModule' will work to do this.
