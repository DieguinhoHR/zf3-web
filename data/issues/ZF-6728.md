### Description

Currently you can not specify the location constraint of new buckets through Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::createBucket().

See [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/â€¦](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?RESTBucketPUT.html) for more information.

Quick patch.

I took a look at Kristof's patch - I would suggest a location parameter rather than an isEU paramater, as Amazon S3 may add further locations in the future.

Assigning to Stas.

The issue is not resolved, I tried with 'EU' location. Seems that the createBucket() doesn't not prepare the PUT request in a correct way. The Content-type is binary instead of text and the Content-size is missing (according with the Amazon S3 API syntax).

Fixed on trunk (commit 24049).
