Which version do you use? In the current version 1.12.1 the line 565 includes only a comment. Please update your ZF copy, test again and give us a feedback. Thanks.

I'm using 2.1.1 What do you mean 1.12.1 is current? o\_O

I used 1.12.1, I got the same errors, just on different lines. It still works on mail servers that aren't SmarterMail

$tokens[2] is set to an empty array.

Can you debug these lines with errors?

What is the content of $tokens?

Here's var\_dumps for each iteration of tokens (looks like it dumped tokens twice). First group is on the working server, then dumps for SmarterMail server. <https://gist.github.com/10836ba166f4054c81bb>

At the very bottom you see $tokens[2] = empty array, which is I guess unexpected.

Can I do anything else to help?
