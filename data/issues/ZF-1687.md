### Description

Changes made in reference to <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1568> alter the expected functionality of Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormCheckbox and break backwards compatibility.

Documented functionality states that the first option in $options is the default checked value. However, if $value is set and the checkbox should not checked by default ($value != $option[0]), two form fields (1 hidden, 1 checkbox) are returned with the value of $value, making it impossible to get the default checked value ($option[0]) returned from the form.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    echo $this->formCheckbox('opt_in', 'no', null, array('yes', 'no'));
    
    Produces:
     
    
    Expected:
