### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector::\_checkCode() only allows certain (30x) status codes to used for generating Location headers.

For RESTful post-actions it would be handy to be able to use the redirector also for HTTP status 201 (Created). The HTTP spec specifically recommends a location header together with these, and since the redirector already has all the nifty support for routes and absolute urls it would come in handy.

It's arguable wether this is a 'redirect', but to me it seems like the nicest solution so far, and would be trivial to implement.

Comments? Shall I supply a patch? bkw
