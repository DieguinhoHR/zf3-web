ZF-9799: Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http send strange http headers
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-05-04T08:12:05.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-09-29T12:15:31.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.5 (26/May/10)

### Description

Zend\_Amf\_Response\_Http currently sends the headers:

Cache-Control: cache, must-revalidate Pragma: public

I was not able to find any documentation of "cache" in Cache-Control and public is also not noted in the Pragma documentation (see [http://w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) )

I think the correct headers to disable caching would be:

Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT

Attached is a patch, which fixes the problem.

Regards Stefan

Thanks for the find. The update has been committed to trunk to reflect the W3C documentation for Cache-Control
