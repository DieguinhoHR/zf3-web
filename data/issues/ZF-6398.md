### Description

Currently (version 1.8) method chain of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain looks like:

 
    public function chain(Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Abstract $route, $separator = '/')
    {
        $route->isPartial(true);
    
        $this->_routes[]     = $route;
        $this->_separators[] = $separator;
    
        return $this;
    
    }


So when you add any Route object to chain it becomes Partial and stop function outside a chain.

Let say we need to reuse some route object in different chains to minimize memory usage. It's ok. But if we need to add this route to router without using chains (i.e. create partial route) it wouldn't function because of Partial flag set to true:

$route1 = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route (......); $route2 = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route (......); $route3 = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route (......);

$router->addRoute($route1); // will be broken because of Partial flag $router->addRoute($route1->chain($route2)); // ok $router->addRoute($route1->chain($route2)->chain(route3)); // ok

Why not set Partial directly in match/assemble methods of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain before calling match method of chain member and set Partial back to false after that.

Your suggestion is possible, but would generate quuite some overhead. My prefered solution is to hand an additional $partial-parameter to the match() and assemble() method, tho this would be a change of the public API. I will make that change with the router refactoring.

Well to minimize overhead there could be also another possible solution:

Remove partial flag, instead of using partial flag check in match/assemble instanceof caller object (If caller is instanceof Router\_Abstract -- path is NOT partial, if instanceof Router\_Route\_Abstract -- path is partial),

Also your solution with default value of partial === null (which will then use isPartial object flag) would be fine and retain backward compatibility
