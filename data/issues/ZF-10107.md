I am not able to reproduce this issue. I am on ZF 1.10.4 from SVN on PHP 5.2.12.

Results are as expected. Please find the attached patch file which adds a unit test which creates a Zend\_Date object for July 1, 2010 and adds 6 months and then asserts the result is January 1, 2011.

Please let me know if I should be providing patches in a different way or if this sort of contribution is helpful or not.

Thank you, David Stockton

You should note that according to the manual, the examples, the class, the code and the unittests the constant "Y" is the ISO year.

The ISO year or Calendar year is the year which is printed on a calendar. The ISO year begins with the week where the thursday is the 1st or higher.

The calendar year is not the real year... look at your calendar and you will see this.

@David: It makes no sense to integrate a patch for things which are definitely non-issues or wrong code/assumptions from a user. When you take a look at Zend\_Date's testbed you will see that it's the biggest testbed from the framework.
