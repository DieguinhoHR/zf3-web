ZF-1491: Impossible to get decoded Mime\_Part after Zend\_Mime\_Message::createFromMessage

### Description

After decoding a mime string using Zend\_Mime\_Message::createFromMessage, it is impossible to get to one Part's body since 1) ->\_content is protected and 2) getContent() tries to encode it a second time, instead of decoding it properly.

This will be fixed with the merge of Zend\_Mime\_Message and Zend\_Mail\_Message.

In the meanwhile if you want to read a mail message you could use Zend\_Mail\_Message:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    $message = new Zend_Mail_Message('file' => '/path/to/message/file');
    // or
    $message = new Zend_Mail_Message('raw' => ... message string ...);
    
    // get header
    echo $message->subject, ' from ', $message->from;
    
    // get content
    if ($message->isMultipart()) {
      foreach (new RecursiveIteratorIterator($message) as $part) {
        echo $part->contentType, ': ', $part->getContent();
      }
    } else {
      echo $message->getContent();
      // or with 5.2
      echo $message;
    }

I hope you're not making Zend\_Mime\_Message tailored only to mail. MIME is used for things other than e-mail, like MM7-encoded MMS messages.

By the way, what's the status of this? It's been nearly a year.

This issue is still open and still applies to the current trunk. I suppose there won't be a fix in zf1 since it will cause BC breaks, are there any plans to address this in ZF2?

Added a getRawContent() method to Zend\_Mime\_Part to retrieve unencoded values in r23713 in trunk and 23714 in release branch 1.11
