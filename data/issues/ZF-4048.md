### Description

I called

 
    <pre class="highlight"> because I supposed, it can list all pages. It was just experiment :)
    
    But it shows errors:


Warning: min() [function.min]: Array must contain at least one element in Zend\\Paginator.php on line 735 Warning: max() [function.max]: Array must contain at least one element in Zend\\Paginator.php on line 736 ```

This is the purpose of scrolling styles in general and Zend\_Paginator\_ScrollingStyle\_All specifically. It is outside the scope of the main class.

In the interest of not performing excessive parameter validation (and thus slowing down the component) per the de facto framework policy, I'm going to close this as a "won't fix" unless there is a compelling reason to reopen.

Even though this isn't technically a bug, thanks for taking the time to report it. If you find any more issues, please report them!
