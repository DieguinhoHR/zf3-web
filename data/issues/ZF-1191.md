### Description

PHPUnit 3.0.0 PHP 5.2.0 Windows XP sp1 Xdebug 2.0.0RC1

Output of phpunit includes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      Zend Framework - Zend_Auth
       Zend Framework - Zend_Auth Adapters
        Zend Framework - Zend_Auth_Adapter_Http
         Zend_Auth_Adapter_Http_ProxyTest
         .F.........


One failure. I have expanded the output to make it more readable.

Deferring to [~gearhead] for initial comment.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to reproduce the problem. It works fine on my machine, so clearly this caused by an environment difference. Looking at the given output, the difference lies in the value of the nonce field. Something on the machine where this is being run is causing it to calculate a different value for the nonce than my machine does. Logically, either the input to the hash is different, or a very unlikely hash collision has occurred.

I ran the unit tests from a clean SVN checkout, and they were successful. Also, I currently use this Auth adapter every day, and it's still working in the browser. (Of course, that's probably no big surprise, since the unit tests also work for me.)

Another thing to consider is that the same exact code calculates the nonces for both Proxy auth and Origin server auth, so if there was an issue in the adapter, it should cause both the AuthTest.php _AND_ ProxyTest.php to fail, in the same place. However, only ProxyTest.php is failing here, implying the problem is in the unit test itself, on that server.

Hope this helps. Let me know if I can be of any more help.

I also cannot reproduce this error on WinXP, PHP 5.1.4, PHPUnit 3.2.15.

I also cannot reproduce with PHP 5.2.5

Maybe it's specific to PHP 5.2.0?

No, I can't reproduce on 5.2.0, either. I'm closing as "cannot reproduce" for now; please feel free to reopen with additional information.
