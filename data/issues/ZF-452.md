### Description

Zend\_View\_Abstract is mostly useless as a point to inherit from for other template libraries as it includes a lot of unncessary code and also assumes a php based templating solution.

I suggest that we merge Zend\_View\_Abstract into Zend\_View and provide Zend\_View\_Interface to cover the common parts of using the View within the MVC components of Zend Framework.

I propose Zend\_View\_Interface to be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Zend_View_Interface
    {
        /**
         * Directly assigns a variable to the view script.
         *
         * @param string $key The variable name.
         * @param mixed $val The variable value.
         * @return void
         */
        public function __set($key, $val);
        
        /**
         * Assigns variables to the view script via differing strategies.
         *
         * Zend_View_Inferface::assign('name', $value) assigns a variable called 'name'
         * with the corresponding $value.
         *
         * Zend_View_Inferface::assign($array) assigns the array keys as variable
         * names (with the corresponding array values).
         *
         * @param string|array $spec The assignment strategy to use.
         * @param mixed (Optional) If assigning a named variable, use this as the value.
         * @return void
         * @see __set()
         */
        public function assign($spec);
        
        /**
         * Processes a view script and returns the output.
         *
         * @param string $name The script script name to process.
         * @return string The script output.
         */
        public function render($name);
        
        /**
         * Set the path to find the view script used by render().
         * 
         * @param string|array The directory (-ies) to set as the path. Note that
         * the concrete view implentation may not necessarily support multiple directories.
         * @return void
         */
        public function setScriptPath($path);    
    }


Then, if someone wanted to implement a Smarty-based View, they could do something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class AkCom_View_Smarty implements Zend_View_Interface 
    {
        protected $_smarty;
        
        function __construct($params=null)
        {
            $this->_smarty = new Smarty;
            
            if (is_array($params)) {
                foreach ($params as $key=>$value) {
                    $this->_smarty->$key = $value;
                }
            }
        }
        
        public function setScriptPath($path)
        {
            if (is_array($path)) {
                thow new Zend_View_Exception('setScriptPath() doesn't support multiple paths');
            } else {
                $this->_smarty->template_dir = $path;
            }
        }
        
        public function render($name) 
        {
            return $this->_smarty->fetch($name);
        }
        
        public function __set($key, $val)
        {
            $this->_smarty->assign($key, $val);
        }
        
        public function assign($spec)
        {
            if (is_string($spec)) {
                if( func_num_args() == 2) {
                    // assign by name and value
                    $this->_smarty->assign($key, func_get_arg(1));
                } else {
                    throw new Zend_View_Exception('assign() expects a string to have a value');
                }
            } elseif (is_array($spec)) {
                // assign from associative array
                foreach ($spec as $key => $val) {
                    $this->_smarty->assign($key, $val);
                }
            } else {
                throw new Zend_View_Exception('assign() expects a string or array, got ' 
                    . gettype($spec));
            }
        }
    }

Zend\_View with all of Zend\_View\_Abstract merged in and implemening Zend\_View\_Interface.

I think this is good. I have a few comments:

- assign(), in the interface, should accept two parameters, the second optional. Otherwise, adding a second parameter in an implementing class will cause an E\_FATAL.
- \_\_get() should also be defined; makes it easier to modify template variables prior to final rendering, and some engines will need this ability
- \_\_isset() for completeness
- clearVars(), for clearing assigned variables (recently implemented in Zend\_View, and already possible in Smarty, for instance)
- getEngine() method -- to retrieve the engine object instance. Particularly useful for allowing the developer to set custom options in the engine (register filters or modifiers with smarty, register helpers with zend\_view or savant, etc.)

I'd almost suggest \_\_call() to proxy method calls to the engine, but that would break tooling for many, and it can be done with getEngine().

If this sounds good, I will implement in the repository.

Though it may not be used in most common use cases, it may be useful to include \_\_unset($name) in the interface for completeness.

Otherwise, this looks very good to me - certainly an improvement over the existing architecture!

By the way, I'm considering Zend\_View\_Interface as an _addition_ to Zend\_View as it stands today.

The idea is that if a developer wishes to incorporate a different template engine into their app, they implement the interface and continue (hopefully, we can get a number of such contributions into the laboratory). Zend\_View and Zend\_View\_Abstract will be used by those who wish to use PHP as their templating solution.

Matthew,

I like your suggestions. Didn't realise you get an E\_FATAL and getEngine() would be useful in most cases.

I don't mind keeping Zend\_View\_Abstract around, though I think it is very specific to Zend\_View personally. I suppose the acid test would be to work out the best way to integrate Savant! Presumably, Zend\_View\_Abstract would implement Zend\_View\_Interface?

All looks good to me regardless :)

Added Zend\_View\_Interface in revision 1545, and updated Zend\_View\_Abstract to implement the interface.
