### Description

FormErrors decorator expects $form->getMessages() to return array containing element's and subforms' names as keys, but if $form->setIsArray(true), topmost key will contain form's name. Next, decorator will request element with that name (form name) from the form, which is obviously can't be there. Finally nothing is rendered.
