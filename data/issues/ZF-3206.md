### Description

When i set a placement for the formRadio Helper, the given value used for setting the checked attribute is overridden. This happens in the formRadion function while the label attributes are processed:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    case 'placement':
      unset($label_attribs[$key]);
      $value = strtolower($val); <- $value is a function parameter and used for checked attribute
      if (in_array($val, array('prepend', 'append'))) {
          $labelPlacement = $val;
      }
      break;


This should be like this i think:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    case 'placement':
      unset($label_attribs[$key]);
      $val = strtolower($val);
      if (in_array($val, array('prepend', 'append'))) {
          $labelPlacement = $val;
      }
      break;
