### Description

I have noticed that unlinke Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect the view helper for radio's Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormRadio does not tries to translate the option labels.

Simple fix would be offcourse to add Just before the option loop (line 135) $translator = $this->getTranslator();

and add just in the loop. if (null !== $translator) { $opt\_label = $translator->translate($opt\_label); }

Please close, noticed that this was due to a bad implementation of a translation adapter.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
