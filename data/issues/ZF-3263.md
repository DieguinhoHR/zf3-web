### Description

If you set MultiSelectOptions on a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select AND you have a translator on the form, then values will be translated if a translation happens to be available.

Concrete example: My form has a _code_ field with a label _code_. This label is translated in Dutch as _code tbv. van vertaling_. That is the intended behavior. The translation is performed by the form's translator.

If someone enters a valid code, named **code** the value gets translated if displayed in a MultiSelect. So then you get

 
    <pre class="highlight"> This is obviously not the desired behavior, since the user of the form will want to select the code he entered and not the arbitrary translation of a label. This bug appears with any value for which there is a translation in the language file. 
    
    If I would add the option array('bogus' => 'save') this would yield 

_Opslaan_ is Dutch for _save_ and it is present in the Dutch language file that is available to the translator.

This applies to the version I just checked out of svn. I suppose that is 1.5.1.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

In this case, I'd have to recommend that you disable the translator for this particular element (use the setDisableTranslator() method and/or 'disableTranslator' configuration option). We cannot and will not support allowing translations selectively on multi-option element options.
