### Description

When using PHPUnit, all warnings are promoted to exceptions and can cause tests to fail when using Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase#assertQuery(). This is because assertQuery() uses Zend\_Dom\_Query, which in turn uses DOMDocument for parsing.

In ZF 1.10.0, errors were suppressed but in 1.10.1 they are not.

Perhaps ZF Zend\_Dom\_Query should be capturing the warnings instead of letting them bubble up to the general error handler. See [http://us.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://us.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.loadhtml.php)

This is already resolved in trunk and the 1.10 release branch, and will release with 1.10.2.
