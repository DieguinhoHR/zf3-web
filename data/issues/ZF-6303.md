I have to say, that's my first 'try' to submit something to the zf. So I choosed this small issue.

Tried to write some test cases, too. But I think it's quied useless, 'cause the tree output is totally based on the system it's running. I copied the normal dump() function and modified it. So I think the normal tests will do the job.
