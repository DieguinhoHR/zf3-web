### Description

Several method invocations in Zend\_Gdata\_YouTubeOnlineTest attempt to use named variables, even though this isn't supported by PHP. For example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
            $httpClient = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient(
                                              $username = $this->user,
                                              $password = $this->pass,
                                              $service = $service,
                                              $client = null,
                                              $source = 'Google-UnitTests-1.0',
                                              $loginToken = null,
                                              $loginCaptcha = null,
                                              $authenticationURL);


should be:

 
    <pre class="literal">
            $httpClient = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient(
                                              $this->user,
                                              $this->pass,
                                              $service,
                                              null,
                                              'Google-UnitTests-1.0',
                                              null,
                                              null,
                                              $authenticationURL);


It may be useful to add comments or use variables where the parameter being referred to isn't clear, but using the = operator is wasteful and should be removed.
