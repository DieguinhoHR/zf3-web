ZF2-124: Zend\_Validator pyrus packages has an invalid optional dependency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Not sure if the bug is in the component itself. Trying to install Zend\_Validator from packages.zendframework.com using the latest pyrus.phar and turning on optional dependencies leads to this:

gaigalas$ php pyrus.phar install -f -o packages.zendframework.com/Zend\_Validator-beta Pyrus version 2.0.0a3 SHA-1: BE7EA9D171AE3873F1BBAF692EEE9165BB14BD5D Using PEAR installation found at /Volumes/Dev/Projects/PEAR PEAR2\\Pyrus\\Channel\\Exception: package Zend\_Server does not exist PEAR2\\Pyrus\\HTTPException: Download of [http://packages.zendframework.com/rest/p/…](http://packages.zendframework.com/rest/p/zend_server/info.xml) failed, file does not exist

This is blocking me from distributing a component that depends on Zend\_Validator.

I'm also not sure on how to contribute to fix this. Is there any repo for the package generator or package.xml files?

Thanks!

There is a place to contribute a patch: <https://github.com/zendframework/ZF2Package>

Each package has a file returning a list of dependencies -- for Zend\_Validator, it's [https://github.com/zendframework/ZF2Package/…](https://github.com/zendframework/ZF2Package/blob/master/data/dependencies/Zend_Validator.php).

Obviously, you also need to trace each package on which a dependency is made to find which one may have the erroneous dependency. Also, if you think a given dependency is _optional_, versus _require_, you can change which array it is returned in (or introduce the "optional" array, if none present).

The actual problem is the Zend\_Json package which has an optional dependency on Zend\_Server. I'll take a closer look in a bit.

[https://github.com/zendframework/ZF2Package/…](https://github.com/zendframework/ZF2Package/blob/2e5d629535c724c1b7aed06c24a249948b584b1e/data/dependencies/Zend_Json.php)

The problem seems to be in the Zend\_Json package indeed, Evan.

I'm actually creating a package which optionally depends on Zend\_Validator. Declaring the optional dependency on package.xml and installing with -o also installs every optional dependency recursively (all the optional dependency tree from Zend\_Validator).

I can't reproduce this with Zend Framework 2 beta 3 and pyrus 2.0.0a4
