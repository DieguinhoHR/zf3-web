### Description

The maximum length of a table field name in Oracle is 30 characters long, but we have a "Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle\_Exception: 972 ORA-00972: identifier is too long" error message when we do an insert or update on a table with fields name of 28, 29 or 30 characters long because in the update and insert functions in the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract class, a colon ":" and an integer "$i" are added to the "$col" name to get a new key for the "$bind" array.
