ZF-8041: Layout controller plugin renders layout even if response was redirect
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend layout controller plugin does not return early on a redirect response code in postDispatch(), thus if the redirector is not configured to exit immediately after redirect (as in test environment), the layout template is still rendered, which may lead to exceptions while rendering (since the view may not be properly set up).
