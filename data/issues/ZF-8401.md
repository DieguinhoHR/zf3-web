ZF-8401: Code outside class body
--------------------------------

 Issue Type: Coding Standards Violation Created: 2009-11-26T04:57:45.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-12-14T03:43:24.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.7 (11/Jan/10)

### Description

In Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_(Docx | Pptx | Xmlx | OpenXml), we have outside of the main class a:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (class_exists('ZipArchive', false)) {


Why not simply throwing an exception in OpenXml's constructor like other components (Zend\_Db adapters)?

(this also stops API documentation generation)

The difference in comparison to Zend\_Db adapters is that Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_\*\*\* MS Office documents objects may be instantiated tens of thousands times (if extension is loaded). Current solution is a bit faster, but you are correct, it produces other problems. So I'll fix it.

Fixed.
