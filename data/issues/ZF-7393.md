ZF-7393: Escape wrong behavior on Japanesse text
------------------------------------------------

### Description

Hi,

I was noticing the escape function from Zend\_View is actually removing the Japanesse text.

$this->view->escape('Ɨ�本語') returns empty string...

I don't know Japanesse so i hope the string posted to escape function itself is fine...

What encoding have you specified for your Zend\_View instance? By default, ISO-8859-1 is used, which would account for the stripping of Japanese characters. If you set the encoding to UTF-8, it should work fine.

You can do that in several ways.

First, if you instantiate Zend\_View yourself, you can pass the encoding as an option:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new Zend_View(array('encoding' => 'UTF-8'));


If you let ZF instantiate Zend\_View (via the ViewRenderer, for instance), you can set the encoding manually at any time:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');


If you are using Zend\_Application, and the View bootstrap resource, define the encoding option for your View resource in your configuration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.encoding = "UTF-8"


This may also be an OS-specific issue. I tried your example on a Linux machine, and the characters displayed fine both when using ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 as encodings.

encoding is already set to UTF-8 into View resource...

Which operating system, and which version of PHP, then? As noted, I did my testing on a linux machine, and tried with both PHP versions 5.2.10 and 5.3.0 -- same results with both ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 encodings set on the view object.

Late, but i am back to the error.

Seems the

 <?php echo $this->escape('Ɨ�本語'); ?> works as expected.

The problem is if passing the Japanese text to a legend:

$form->setLegend($valueLang);

Then it doesn't display anything...

Did more research on this.

The Zend\_View\_Helper\_Fieldset is doing this:

 
                $legend = '<legend>'
                        . (($escape) ? $this->view->escape($legendString) : $legendString)
                        . '</legend>' . PHP_EOL;


Seems escaping ($this->view->escape($legendString)) is actually removing the Japanese text.

The view encoding is UTF-8.

Dev system (can't test now on production system) is WinXP/Apache 2.2.11/PHP 5.3.0/ZF 1.10 (but the problem is on other ZF versions as well, as initially i tested on 1.7-1.8 or so).
