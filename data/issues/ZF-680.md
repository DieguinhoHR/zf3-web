### Description

If the $class parameter contains an underscore (e.g. happens when modules are being used) the innermost while loop will go into an endless loop since "substr($class, strpos($class, '_'));" will return the underscore as the first character, the Class will - usually unless you Class name really start with an underscore ;) - not be found and the while condition "strstr($class, '_')" will never be false.

Solution: change line 562 in Zend/Controller/Dispatcher.php to add 1 to the strpos() offset and it works just fine:

$class = substr($class, strpos($class, '\_')+1);

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
