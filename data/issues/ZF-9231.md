### Description

The issue [ZF-8668](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8668) notified in version 1.9.6, has not been corrected in the current version (on the SVN repository)

When instantiating an instance of Zend\_File\_Transfer, the following exception is thrown:

=> Adapter Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http does not extend Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter

The error is in the Zend\_File\_Transfer class at line 77 when testing the class compatibility : {quote} if (!$this->\_adapter[$direction] instanceof Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter){ require\_once 'Zend/File/Transfer/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Exception("Adapter " . $adapter . " does not extend Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter"); } {quote}

=> Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter doesn't exist. replace with Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract

Thanks for all.
