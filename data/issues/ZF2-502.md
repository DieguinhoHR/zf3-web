### Description

Hello, I'm writing to notice what seems to be an issue in AbstractRowGateway

_The code bellow in line 104_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function populate(array $rowData, $rowExistsInDatabase = false)
        {
            $this->initialize();
    
            $this->data = $rowData;
            if ($rowExistsInDatabase == true) {
                $this->processPrimaryKeyData();
            } else {
                $this->primaryKeyData = null;
            }
    
            return $this;
        }


_When called to populate the object with existing data from the database the call is:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row = new RowGateway("id", "supplier", $adapter);
    $row->populate((array)$someRow, true);


_when changing the data the call would be:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row->populate((array)$someformValues);


_The issue is that if you do this the second call will clear the primary Key fields_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $row->populate((array)$someformValues);


So, my point is that the else block should be removed from this. If a new row is to be created or the value cleared the "user" should insert new values.

Best regards, FR

PS: The Unknown macro seems to be a issue of the parser in this wiki system.

populate() is not really for "changing data". As you can see, $this->data = $rowData; every time populate is called. If you want to change data (from an array), we really need a separate method for that, or alter the data row-by-row via the object or array interface for the object.

Ok, your correct.

But then can we just add a new method for this...

public function setFromArray(array $newData ) { foreach ($newData as $k => $v ) { if (array\_key\_exists($k, $this->data)){ $this->data[$k] = $v; } } return $this; }

This is copying a method from ZF1 not sure if it's exactly like this in zf1. Anyway just talking.

BR, Andr√©
