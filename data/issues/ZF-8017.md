ZF-8017: Zend\_Service\_Twitter\_Search should not extend Zend\_Http\_Client

### Description

Hi,

Currently Zend\_Service\_Twitter\_Search extends Zend\_Http\_Client, this is bad because :

a) Zend\_Service\_Twitter\_Search is NOT a Zend\_Http\_Client - it merely uses one (hence an architecture issue)

b) It does not make it possible for a mock Zend\_Http\_Client to be introduced to perform tests

c) It does not make it possible to use a subclass of Zend\_Http\_Client - which may have e.g. local site specific proxy / caching settings.

thanks David.

Do you have any comment's on what it should extend use to get the data from Twitter?

Jon -

Why do you think it needs to extend anything to get data from Twitter?

Can't it just USE a http client? In much the same way as e.g. Zend\_Service\_Twitter, Zend\_Service\_Flickr and so on use e.g. the rest client.

David,

I agree with you. I'll have it extend the Zend\_Rest\_Client so it has have more control over it.

The patch would solve my issue with injection of a different http client; thanks.

The patch was checked in to the trunk with r18573 and into the release branch with r18574.

Changing fix version to next minor release (1.10), as it was solved by changing the dependency from Zend\_Http\_Client to Zend\_Rest\_Client. (Adding or changing dependencies is not allowed in mini releases.)

r18574 has been reverted at this time.
