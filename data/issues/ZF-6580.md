### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Routes may not ommit segments when part of a chain and not being the last element

ex : /language/module/controller/index

when using helper url("module" => "other", "controller" => "test") this return //other/test/

the language parram is ommited and the url is truncated. This is only when route.defaults.language = "lang" is set.
