### Description

I find InvalidArgumentException in render()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function render($text, $encoding = 'UTF-8')
        {
            if (!is_string($text)) {
                throw new InvalidArgumentException('$text must be a string');
            }


No need to change into Zend\_Text\_Figlet\_Exception ??

Added class/file InvalidArgumentException and called that instead of the standard PHP InvalidArgumentException.

There are a few other components using the standard PHP exception class. Fix them too?

I don't think so, let's take Matthew a look over it before changing anything.

Throwing SPL exceptions is perfectly valid, and in this case, provides better semantic meaning for the exception itself.

Throwing SPL's exception, is it against manual? [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.exception.html)

Reopen for Mr. Sasezaki. I hear that he could not use reopen command.

Thanks, Satoru.

I had found similar issue. //in ZF-directory

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    grep -r 'throw new' . | grep -v Zend 


Throwing Zend\_Exception-instances in ZF-Classes, wasn't it ZF(ver1)'s policy?

Hello, Sasezaki.

Thanks for comment. As we know currently, ZF2 will implement extends-spl-exception for each components. So, I think this issue can be closed. (But ZF2 is still development!:-) As above Matthew comment, he don't think it is not good that be able not catching every exceptions by Zend\_Exception. So that,,, this is not "Coding Standards Violation".
