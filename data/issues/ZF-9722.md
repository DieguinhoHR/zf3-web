### Description

It is impossible to nest decorators inside Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label in a way similar way to what the HtmlTag decorator does by default. At the moment, it is only possible to append or prepend the label tag, not nest it. I want to create markup that looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    
        Country
        


(This is the markup required for Uni-Form [<http://sprawsm.com/uni-form/>] to have multiple elements on one line)
