### Description

In the Zend/Rest/Client.php, I find an unimplemented form as get('/sayHello', 'Foo', 'manchu') .

I think we can not use get('/sayHello', 'Foo', 'Manchu') now. We must use sayHello('Foo', 'Manchu') instead of the form as above-mentioned.

I think on of the docblock or the implementation of \_\_call() is wrong.
