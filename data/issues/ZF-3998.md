### Description

The datastore generation method, where on uses array\_keys: store, storeType and storeParams doesn't work. Resolution: in library/Zend/Dojo/View/Helper/ComboBox.php (Line: 90) the wrong arrayKey in $storeParams gets set, it should be $storeParams['params'], not $storeParams['storeParams']
