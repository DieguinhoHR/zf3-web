The problem is originaly reported by Antony Dovgal.

Zend\_Uri\_Http uses recursive regexps one of which fails with some data (see attachment).

Testing script:

    $pattern="/^(?:[;\/?:@&=+$,]|(?:[^\W_]|[-_.!~*\'()\[\]])|(?:%[\da-fA-F]{2}))*$/";
    $url = file_get_contents('httpbug.txt');
    $status  = preg_match($pattern, $url,$arr); echo '######'; die(); ?>

I created a testcase with the URL you provided and I have no problems ( see CS 12039) Can this be related to the fact that I am testing on a 64bit machine?

I will try to run the testcase on some more machines and see if it fails.

Should be fixed in CS 12041
