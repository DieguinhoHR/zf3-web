### Description

If you have a form with a subform with a name of numerical value

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Form extends Zend_Form {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->addSubForm($mySubform, 0);
    
        }
    }


and you clone that form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new My_Form();
    $form2 = clone $form;


you will get the following exception: "Invalid name provided; must contain only valid variable characters and be non-empty"

reason being the \_\_clone method uses the addSubForms method and in the addSubFroms method it sets the $name = null and then never sets it to anything else unless the $key is a string. As you can see, the addSubfrom method allowed me to add a subform with a numeric name, therefore it is logical that the addSubForms() method would do the same.

If you remove line 1645-1648 of Zend\_Form, it solves the problem:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                $name = null;
                if (!is_numeric($key)) {
                    $name = $key;
                }

I agree, the addSubForm() allows you to specify a numeric value as name, this means that addSubForms() should have the same behaviour. I will provide a fix and a unit test for that, thanks.

Solved in trunk (commit 24155). Try it and let me know, thanks.
