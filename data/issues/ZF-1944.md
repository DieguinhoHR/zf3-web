### Description

When trying to send mail to qmail server, this exception is produced:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception' with message '451 See <http://pobox.com/~djb/docs/smtplf.html>. ' in /usr/local/lib/php/ZendFramework-1.0.0/library/Zend/Mail/Protocol/Abstract.php:351 Stack trace:

==============================================================================================================================

4 /root/mail.php(16): Zend\_Mail->send()
========================================

qmail appears to be especially zealous about the cr/lf line endings, and it looks like Zend\_Mail does not create the correct ones.

Here is the script code:

<?php require\_once 'Zend/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php'; require\_once 'Zend/Mail.php'; $tr = new Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp('10.1.1.1'); Zend\_Mail::setDefaultTransport($tr); $mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $mail->setFrom("stas@zend.com"); $mail->addTo("stas@zend.com"); $mail->setSubject('Activation Code - '); $body .="\\n\\nPleasea activate your account.\\n\\n"; $body .="Confirmation Code: \\n"; $body .="\\n\\n"; $body .= "Please confirm your account by copy/pasting following URL\\n"; $body .= "\\n\\n\\n"; $mail->setBodyText($body); $mail->send();

10.1.1.1 is internal qmail server.

Looks like the problem is that when encoding to quoted-printable, the line ends are set as \\n (0x0a) while they should be \\r\\n (0x0d 0x0a). Apparently qmail hates that.

Hi Stas - has this behaviour been resolved in 1.0.2 for you?

 

 

Posted by Stanislav Malyshev (stas) on 2007-11-06T01:51:17.000+0000

No, still happens in 1.0.2

How about the latest component in trunk? I was comparing this to an earlier version and it seems that revision didn't make it to 1.0.2 - the newer trunk version resolves a couple of issues with line endings. If you could please re-check with that version we may be able to resolve this lingering issue.

Yes, trunk sends the mail correctly.

Resolved in trunk - will be released ASAP.
