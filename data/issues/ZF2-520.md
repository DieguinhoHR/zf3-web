### Description

ZF2 RC7 Steps to reproduce: Initialize logging with writer and register the exception handler Logger::registerExceptionHandler Create a view script that throws an exception Dispatch the controller Note that request fails

Expected Log will hold a properly formatted exception message with readable trace, e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ERR (3): exception 'Zend\Form\Exception\DomainException' with message 'Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormLabel::__invoke expects either label ..... Form/View/Helper/FormLabel.php:114
    Stack trace:
    #0 [internal function]: Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormLabel->__invoke(Object(Zend\Form\Element))
    #1 /home/yonni/Zend/workspaces/DefaultWorkspace/ZendFramework-minimal-2.0.0rc7/library/Zend/View/Renderer/PhpRenderer.php(353): call_user_func_array(Object(Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormLabel), Array)
    #2 /home/yonni/Zend/workspaces/DefaultWorkspace/gui.new/module/ZendServer/src/ZendServer/View/Helper/Form/Renderer/Table.php(36): Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer->__call('FormLabel', Array)


Actual Log holds a json\_encoded trace which is very difficult to decipher and seems to have gone through multiple character escaping. The entry is one long string, I broke it apart for easier reading

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend\Form\View\Helper\FormLabel::__invoke expects ..... neither found {"file":"\/home\/yonni\/Zend\/workspaces\/DefaultWorkspace\/ZendFramework-minimal-2.0.0rc7\/library\/Zend\/Form\/View\/Helper\/FormLabel.php","line":114,"trace":"[\"
    {\\\"function\\\":\\\"__invoke\\\",\\\"class\\\":\\\"Zend\\\\\\\\Form\\\\\\\\View\\\\\\\\Helper\\\\\\\\FormLabel\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"->\\\",\\\"args\\\":\\\"
    [\\\\\\\"object(Zend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Form\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Element) {}\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",
    \"{\\\"file\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\/home\\\\\\\/yonni\\\\\\\/Zend\\\\\\\/workspaces\\\\\\\/DefaultWorkspace\\\\\\\/ZendFramework-minimal-2.0.0rc7\\\\\\\/library\\\\\\\/Zend\\\\\\\/View\\\\\\\/Renderer\\\\\\\/PhpRenderer.php\\\",\\\"line\\\":353,\\\"function\\\":\\\"call_user_func_array\\\",\\\"args\\\":
    \\\"[\\\\\\\"object(Zend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Form\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\View\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Helper\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\FormLabel) {}\\\\\\\",
    \\\\\\\"[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object(Zend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Form\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Element) {}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",
    \"{\\\"file\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\/home\\\\\\\/yonni\\\\\\\/Zend\\\\\\\/workspaces\\\\\\\/DefaultWorkspace\\\\\\\/gui.new\\\\\\\/module\\\\\\\/ZendServer\\\\\\\/src\\\\\\\/ZendServer\\\\\\\/View\\\\\\\/Helper\\\\\\\/Form\\\\\\\/Renderer\\\\\\\/Table.php\\\",\\\"line\\\":36,\\\"function\\\":\\\"__call\\\",\\\"class\\\":\\\"Zend\\\\\\\\View\\\\\\\\Renderer\\\\\\\\PhpRenderer\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"->\\\",\\\"args\\\":\\\"[\\\\\\\"FormLabel\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object(Zend\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Form\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Element) {}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\\\"]\\\"}\",\"{\\\"file\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\/home\\\\\\\/yonni
    .....


To resolve this locally I changed the following line (Zend\\Log\\Logger.php:437)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $logger->log(Logger::ERR, $exception->getMessage(), $extra);


To

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $logger->log(Logger::ERR, $exception);


Effectively forcing the logger to use its own internal normalization and formatter

You can define your own exception handler. I don't think that we use the toString render of an exception, but improve the exception formatter.

I hope that you have extended your zf2 version instead of change the file. Do you know it's bad (practice)?

Too many slashes :)

Naturally, extended outside the framework. Just to be sure this is clear - the same thing happens when any sort of extras array is passed, not only exceptions
