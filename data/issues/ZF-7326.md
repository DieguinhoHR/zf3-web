### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module::assemble() takes a fourth parameter "$partial" which is never used in the method body.

Additionnaly, the same $partial is used in match() method, but the PHPDoc block about it is missing.

Third, there is another missing PHPDoc bloc, in assemble() method (again) : $encode is not documented
