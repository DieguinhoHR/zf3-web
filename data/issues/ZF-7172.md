### Description

There is no description in the docs how to instatiate the ZendServer cache backends

This wont work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core',
                                         'ZendServer_ShMem',
                                         $frontendOptions,
                                         $backendOptions
                                         );


The problem is the name normalize function.

The 6. parameter has to be true and the name have to be full written.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core',
                                         'Zend_Cache_Backend_ZendServer_ShMem',
                                         $frontendOptions,
                                         $backendOptions,
                                         false,
                                         true
                                         );


May it will be better the two backends move from backend/ZendServer/ to /backend/ and move the abstract class ZendServer to backend/ZendServer

I think there are 3 problems.

1) $standardBackends in Zend/Cache.php has no entry for the Zend Server backends.

2) The factory parameter.may be not ZendServer\_ShMem, but Zend Server\_ShMem (or may be Zend\_Server\_ShMem).

3) We can not find detail about using the Zend Server backends .

I would vote the comment of vincent. "the two backends move from backend/ZendServer/ to /backend/".

If we would move the 2 class to /backend/ZendServerDisk.php and /backend/ZendServerShmem.php, they could work more easy.

Add description to manual at SVN r17742 . This issue could be solved without code change.nor class moving.
