ZF-6307: Add validator parameter to Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_getParam()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-04-15T10:20:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:17.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I often find that I am writing a block of code like this to get a parameter and validate it.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        $default = 0;
        $validator = new Zend_Validate_Digits();
        if (false === ($validator->isValid($this->_getParam('parameter', $default)))) {
           $param = $default;
        }


Being able to do this would be much nicer:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        $param = $this->_getParam('parameter', 0, new Zend_Validate_Digits());


I will attach a patch to allow this to work. If this is wanted I will provide tests.

The validation of the route-parameters should usually be done with the "reqs"-param of the routes. Suggesting WONTFIX.

I disagree, in order to use the "reqs" param, you need to add a route. This will obviously not work with the default routes. If I add a route for every time I needed paramaters in the URL i'd end up with a few hundred routes in every app just to deal with this. I don't always want to add a route to add parameters to an action. Also \_getParams can be used for $\_GET and $\_POST paramaters, (if you set the param sources to allow it), which obviously a route would not be able to validate.

This is basically a poor man's poka-yoke. I like the idea, but it's the wrong location -- this should be in the request object, not the action controller.

Nice idea. +1

Perhaps you can even think of injecting both a validator (could be a validator-chain) and a filter (could be a filter-chain).

This improvement should base on a proposal, as filtering may another part of this. Our current idea for layout of \_getParam() is, that it proxied to getParam() of the request object with the following method signature:

\_getParam($param, $default, array('validator' => ..., 'filter' => ...));

There is now a proposal for this @ [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Controller_Request+-+Add+validation+and+filtering+to+getParam%28%29)
