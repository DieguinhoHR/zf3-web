### Description

I the the message mentioned above when I am using Zend\_Mail on some of our servers.

There is a similar bug report on PEAR about the package Mail\_Mime: <http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=10146>

I guess it will need a similar solution as the one mentioned in this bug report.

More information about my system. It is a CentOS 5.5 server with PHP version 5.2.17 from the testing repository of CentOS. The file /etc/php.ini is the standard file delivered by the OS (with "mbstring.func\_overload = 7" set).
