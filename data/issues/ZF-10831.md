ZF-10831: Distinct statement doesn't work with basic limit in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv

### Description

I have found an error with basic limit statement if I use Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Sqlsrv as database adapter. Here is example:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $adapter = Zend_Registry::get('dbAdapter'); // Instance of Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv
    $select = $adapter->select();
    
    $select->distinct();
    $select->from('Foo', array('FooID'));
    $select->limit(5);
    echo $select->__toString();


The result is following:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    SELECT TOP 5 DISTINCT "Foo"."FooID" FROM "Foo"


But it produces database error. TOP have to be after DISTINCT.

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    SELECT DISTINCT TOP 5 "Foo"."FooID" FROM "Foo"


I'm using Zend Framework 1.11.1, Zend Server 5.0.2 (PHP 5.3.2), MSSQL 2005 Express.

The issue that you cannot use distinct() combined with a limit() clause in a select statement is still present in 1.11.4. I fixed it in our local installation with the following change (works in 1.11.3 and 1.11.4):

In Zend/Db/Adapter/Sqlsrv.php change line 616 from: $sql = preg\_replace('/^SELECT\\s/i', 'SELECT TOP ' . $count . ' ', $sql);

to: $sql = preg\_replace('/^(SELECT\\sDISTINCT\\s|SELECT\\s)/i', '$0 TOP ' . $count . ' ', $sql);

This will place the DISTINCT keyword before the TOP keyword.

Same as above comment with pretty printing: from:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    to:

In Zend/Db/Adapter/Sqlsrv.php change line 615: if ($offset == 0) { $sql = preg\_replace('/^SELECT\\s+(DISTINCT\\s)?/i', 'SELECT TOP ' . $count . ' ', $sql); } else { to: $sql = preg\_replace( '/^SELECT\\s+(DISTINCT\\s)?/i', 'SELECT $1TOP ' . ($count+$offset) . ' ', $sql ); if($offset > 0) {

Still not fixed in 1.11.11, over a year later.
