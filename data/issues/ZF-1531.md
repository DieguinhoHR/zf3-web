Please do not assign issues yourself to anyone... this is done by the dev-team ;-)

To the docu... I did not write the complete docu and the TMX adapter was created the same way as all other adapters... you must/can define which languages should be added. The docu is wrong in this point.

It's not that simple as with in your diff, because then all languages are added ALWAYS, which is also not a 100% solution. Maybe we will add an new option to that adapter... have to think about it.

New option integrated with SVN 5360 to seperate languages. Default is to add all found languages.

Resolved with SVN 5370.

Single languages can be defined with the option 'defined\_language'. Standard is to add all found languages.
