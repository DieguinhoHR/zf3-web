### Description

Hi, I'm using action helper in my view scripts (I realy like this one :-)).Last day I notticed that request in this "nested action" is missing some useful params (module/controller/action)

class SomeController{ ..... nestedAction{ $this->\_request->getParam('controller') // return NULL . $this->\_request->getControllerName() // return "some" } ...... }

VIEW: $this->action('nested','some','default',array());

For consistency I think that both method should return same value.

Thanks for your hard work

I disagree with you on that both functions should return the value as controller is not a param but way to tell the system what to do. I think the system is functioning the way it should.
