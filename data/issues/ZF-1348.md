### Description

Currently the Zend\_Translate component do not have method to know if a sentence is translated in a language or not, translate() just return the source sentence.

A isTranslated() method can be added to correct this missing feature.

Here a possible implementation of the method :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function isTranslated($messageId, $locale = null)
        {
            if ($locale === null) {
                $locale = $this->_locale;
            } else {
                if (!$locale = Zend_Locale::isLocale($locale)) {
                    // language does not exist, return false
                    return false;
                }
            }
    
            if (array_key_exists($locale, $this->_translate)) {
               if (array_key_exists($messageId, $this->_translate[$locale])) {
                    // translation exist, return true
                    return true;
               }
            } else if (strlen($locale) != 2) {
                // faster than creating a new locale and separate the leading part
                $locale = substr($locale, 0, -strlen(strrchr($locale, '_')));
    
                if (array_key_exists($locale, $this->_translate)) {
                    if (array_key_exists($messageId, $this->_translate[$locale])) {
                        // translation exist, return true
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            // no translation found, return false
            return false;
        }


As you can see the method is very similar to the translate() method, so it can be a simple option to add to the translate() method who make it return false when the sentence to translate was not found.

First: Your description and the sourcecode do not work together... the sourcecode returns true even if the string is not avaiable in the source language but only in the deferred one.

Second: All major languages do NOT give such functionality because translation should not be computed. We are normaly here within the view, where such logic should not be integrated.

Third: As this is a feature-request I will need feedback from the dev-team if this feature should be integrated or not. The core library is almost ready for 1.0 and new feature have to be integrated very carefully.
