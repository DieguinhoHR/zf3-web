### Description

-------- Original Message -------- Subject: [fw-i18n] Re: [fw-core] Zend\_Filter & Zend\_Validate Date: Thu, 08 Feb 2007 10:36:53 -0800 From: Gavin Vess [gavin@zend.com](mailto:gavin@zend.com)

I will make a suggestion to consider the use of Zend\_Translate and the use of "translatable strings". Since documentation is not done, the idea behind "translatable strings" is documented clearly below: [http://gnu.org/software/gettext/â€¦](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_mono/gettext.html#SEC15)

If the messages below were returned as "translatable strings", then Ralf could use Zend\_Translate to accomplish what he wants to do.

Cheers, Gavin

If you want to get fancier, you could examine the messages returned from getMessages() and change your user-defined error message to be dependent on these.

Related to this issue there are three major problems...

1.) The user needs a list of messages, probably an array or an file, where he can find all messages which he needs to translate. And this is relevant for all classes of the framework.

2.) Related the "translatable" messages we also have the problem that exceptions have none parameters or one or two or even three which also have to be returned or even more...

3.) The messages also have to be viewable if Zend Translate is not avaiable because the user works only with some classes and deleted the rest.

Greetings Thomas, Zend\_Translate-Master :-)

I agree. For example, we would need to replace the variable portions out of the message strings with place holders and bundle the values of the placeholders as lists with each message returned.

Also, we should carefully distinguish between error messages intended for the developer of the ZF app, and error messages that are intended for reading by the users of the ZF app.

Changing to unassigned; need more feedback and action plan before assigning to appropriate persons.

Resolving this issue as "Incomplete" because it is more appropriate to use the proposal process than a JIRA issue to track this feature request. It applies to all components in Zend Framework.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
