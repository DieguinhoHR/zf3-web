### Description

There is already a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, and Zend\_Db\_Table is an empty class. If Zend\_Db\_Table was concrete, I could do this without any issues:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $categoryTable = new Zend_Db_Table(array(
                                           'db'      => 'db',
                                           'name'    => 'category',
                                           'primary' => 'id'));


It seems like a mistake.

I believe what is now Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract used to be Zend\_Db\_Table. I think it was moved to make it consistent with naming conventions throughout the rest of the framework and that it was kept as an abstract class to maintain backward compatibility.

Couple points for clarification:

1) Turning an abstract into a concrete class shouldn't affect backward compatibility 2) An abstract Zend\_Db\_Table class is inconsistent with other similar classes in ZendFW where a class was split into an abstract and concrete. For example: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract (abstract) and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row (concrete). Another example: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract (abstract) and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset (concrete).

Someone probably forgot to remove the 'abstract' keyword from the Zend\_Db\_Table definition when it was split into two classes.

The class also has @depreciated version 0.9 for some reason, should it be there?

Changed title

this would also require some better loadClass() handling inside row and rowset.

Fixed for ZF 1.9 as of r16802
