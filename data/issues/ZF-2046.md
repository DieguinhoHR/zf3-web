I am not able to verify this... But CLDR returns "週六" as string for saturday.

If this string is also ok, you can check out SVN 6602 and give us response.

If use ISO format 'EEEE', it display correctly. but still display incorrect if use PHP format and use 'D' format tag.

And another issue, the PHP format tag 'I' and 'L' both display digit, not match with the document described 'Day of the week, localized, complete'.

I am not able to verify the last example you gave... Your code produces the following complete different output than you gave:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Sunday
    Sonntag
    星期日
    Sun
    Son
    星
    Sun
    So
    週日


The "EEE" format, does not work with multi-byte characters, but as this is a self generated format it should not have negative effects.

{quote}And another issue, the PHP format tag 'I' and 'L' both display digit, not match with the document described 'Day of the week, localized, complete'.{quote}

Within PHP format "I" is the summertime (1 summertime, 0 wintertime)... "L" is the leapyear (1 leapyear, 0 not)...

You can see php.net/date to verify this. And the output when I set this is correct

 
    <pre class="highlight">echo $t1->toString("I",null,"zh_TW")."\n";
    echo $t1->toString("L",null,"zh_TW")."\n";
    
    // output
    1


The API documentation does not write anything different.

If you have any other issue, which do not belong to this one, please write a new issue.

It's simpler for the community when they have a problem and search if an issue already exists and maybe already have been solved.

would that because I am using windows so the result is different between us ?

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-10-07T10:26:50.000+0000

No, I am also using windows for my tests.

The difference is probably because you are using a outdated version. Please check the revision you are using and update to Revision 6602 or higher as written in my first reply to this issue.

 

 

Posted by Liber Chen (liber) on 2007-10-15T11:37:42.000+0000

Yes, it worked after update to rev.6602. but the tag 'EEE' still empty.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-10-15T13:28:08.000+0000

The mentioned token 'EEE' is a non-standard token. It's an abbreviation of the weekday and returns the first three bytes of the name. This format is not supported by CLDR... it is generated.

It does not work for multibyte characters... I already mentioned this in one of my previous replys.
