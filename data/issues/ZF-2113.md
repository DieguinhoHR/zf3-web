ZF-2113: $where not properly initialized in \_cascadeDelete()
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-10-30T10:40:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-28T02:11:51.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.2 (13/Oct/08)

### Description

The variable $where is not properly initialized in the reference map loop in \_cascadeDelete():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    should be
    


case self::CASCADE: $where = array();```

Apart from the fact that the variable isnt initialized correctly itself, the where clauses are just added to the $where stack for each reference loop.

Is there any reason why this bug isn't fixed so far (its still unfixed in 1.5.0RC3)? This makes working with references impossible...

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

[~jsorgalla], if you were to [submit a CLA](http://framework.zend.com/community/contribute), you could commit fixes like these yourself and increase the impact of your contributions to ZF! Of course, thank you for the report! :)

Solved in SVN r11042. I fix not only \_cascadeDelete function but also \_cascadeUpdate function in /Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php .

Because \_cascadeUpdate function has also same problem as \_cascadeDelete function , I think.

Please merge this to the 1.6 release branch.
