### Description

After discussion with Andi Gutmans and Darby Felton:

Andi suggests to cache the result of the preg\_match() so that if this function is called often we don't redetect each time.

You can just have a static member in the class.

These classes require attention:

- Zend\_Filter\_Alnum
- Zend\_Filter\_Alpha
- Zend\_Filter\_Digit
