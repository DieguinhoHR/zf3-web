### Description

In the function \_parseCmapTable() in the class Zend\_Pdf\_FileParser\_Font\_OpenType there is a problem with the usage of an uninitialized variable in lines 780 and 781. The lines looks like this:

$this->\_debugLog('Offset 0x%x out of range for platformID: %d; skipping', $tableOffset, $platformID);

The variable $tableOffset has not been initialized in the context of the function \_parseCmapTable() nor was it passed to the function as a parameter. It might be that variable $subtableOffset should be used instead of $tableOffset.

This was a copy-and-paste error. Corrected the variable name as suggested.
