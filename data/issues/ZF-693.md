### Description

I have a problem with large unoptimized index storage. If I use something like $index->setMergeFactor(10000) for fastest indexing and $index->optimize() call at the end to get the one optimized file. I got the "PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Exception' with message 'failed to open stream: Too many open files' ". The instant $index->optimize() call after this error does not help, it dies with the same error. The indexes directory contains about 2048 files which equals the max opened files for php engine. Actually I've got the broken indexing storage which was reinited and files reindexed with the $index->setMergeFactor(100) without problems.

The PC test configuration: Win2k3+PHP 5.1.6 + Zend Framework 0.6 based SVN version.

Assigning to Alexander.

Problem is caused by too large merge factor.

Merge factor is a good estimation for number of segments merged by one auto-optimization pass. Too large values produce large number of segments while they are not merged into new one.This limitation is system dependant.

PS Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't close segment files while it's prepared for searching. So it may be a cause of 'too many open files' error.

PPS This info is included into MergeFactor description in a documentation now.

This behavior causes wrong files cleanup when used one time with indexing procedure, right? Thats why my storage sometimes contains garbage files, and log contains error messages about file deletion error.

Why do you think so? Files are still opened while they are still used for search. Zend\_Search\_Lucene object destructor closes all files and makes necessary cleans. Index optimization creates new segments, waits until all performed parallel searches are not done, blocks new searches (index opening operations) up to this moment and deletes unused segments when ones requests are done and others are not started yet.

There is an open issue for Zend\_Search\_Lucene for Windows platform, which needs "delayed file deleting" implementation ([ZF-412](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-412)). This feature is provided by Lucene index format, but Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't produce files, which need delayed deleting.

If you have any garbage files in the index directory, then it's a bug (but not this bug). Could you describe it in more details? Please feel free to contact me directly (alexander.v@zend.com) or create another issue for this problem.

PS Zend\_Search\_Lucene opens only files which are listed as active index segments. So, any garbage files can't be a cause of 'too many open files' error.

Yes, this problem does not match this bug. I just wanted to ask if the behavior you pointed in the postscriptum may cause another my problem which I can't localize yet. I will check again with my tests and report the bug if still present or email you instead.

Thanks for your work.

OK! Please keep me posted and thank you for the report!
