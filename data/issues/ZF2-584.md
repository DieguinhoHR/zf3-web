ZF2-584: No output with iso8859-1
---------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-09-25T10:40:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:11:02.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Tests:

 
        $array = array('lalaü' => utf8_decode('tütütüt'));
    
        \Zend\Debug\Debug::dump($array);


Output:

 


 
        var_dump($array);


Output: array(1) { ["lalaü"]=> string(7) "t�t�t�t" }

I pulled iso8859-1 content out of our database and wanted to look at the array and got nothing. We have xdebug disabled and in the if (line 111) $output = static::getEscaper()->escapeHtml($output); sets output to empty.
