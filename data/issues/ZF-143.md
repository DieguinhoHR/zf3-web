### Description

i love using function \_\_autoload($class) { Zend::loadClass($class); } and i also love using $view = new Zend\_View(); $view->setHelperPath('application/helpers'); but it's imposible, as i would get and exception unless i create a local Zend/View/Helper folder and shuv all the helpers there. it works but that's not intuitive, and i would like to see an option to autoload it from the helper paths

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
