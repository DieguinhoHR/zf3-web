### Description

Hi,

While working to retrieve object's information for a set of files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, I realized that the "Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::getObjectsByBucket()" method, retrieves but chooses to ignore most of the data that the xml request retrieves.

I performed some minor lines changes in the method to avoid this, and I thought that you might want to give it a look and see if the change can be considered to patch the current version;

My version of the method;

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getObjectsByBucket($bucket, $params = array())
        {
            $response = $this->_makeRequest('GET', $bucket, $params);
    
            if ($response->getStatus() != 200) {
                return false;
            }
    
            $xml = new SimpleXMLElement($response->getBody());
    
            $objects = array();
            if (isset($xml->Contents)) {
                $i = 0;
                foreach ($xml->Contents as $contents) {
                    foreach ($contents->Key as $object) {
                        $objects[$i]["name"] = (string)$object;
                    }
                    foreach ($contents->LastModified as $object) {
                        $objects[$i]["mtime"] = strtotime((string)$object);
                    }
                    foreach ($contents->Size as $object) {
                        $objects[$i]["size"] = (int)$object;
                    }
                    foreach ($contents->ETag as $object) {
                        $objects[$i]["etag"] = (string)$object;
                    }
                ++$i;
                }
            }
    
            return $objects;
        }


This works much better for me (quicker/simpler) in order to get all information of requested objects stored at Amazon S3, instead of having to retrieve it one by one using the "getInfo()" method on each one.

I am probably missing something and this can be achieved differently/better without having to mess with the ZF original code, if so, I would appreciate if you could indicate me how.

Best regards, Gonzalo.
