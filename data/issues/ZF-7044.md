### Description

I was looking for an HTTP based JSON-RPC client that easily hooked into Zend\_Json\_Server. At first, I thought it might already be included as part of Zend\_Http\_Client, but I couldn't find anything specifically for it. The core of it seems trivial in nature, though I'd suspect one would want the same results as Zend\_Soap\_Client and Zend\_Rest\_Client.

I have attached an example of Zend\_Json\_Client. Pretty bare bones stuff which relies on \_\_call(), Zend\_Json, and Zend\_Http\_Client to accomplish simple tasks such as:

$client = new Zend\_Json\_Client($jsonRpcUri); $result = $client->getSqrt(9.0); echo $result; // 3.0

I apologize if this has already been done elsewhere and my research missed it. I just thought it would be nice to have a JSON-RPC as a local interface experience.

Example of what Zend\_Json\_Client could be.

This has been brought up before by others, actually. That said... it really needs a full formal proposal as it's a fairly large new feature. If you would like to spear-head this feature, please take a look at our proposal process and submit! :)

Ok, I'll give it a shot over the next few weeks.
