### Description

There are two xml-files.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>


and

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>


and the sample code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
        require_once 'Zend/Config.php';
        require_once 'Zend/Config/Xml.php';
        
        $config = new Zend_config_xml('/path/to/config.xml');
        foreach ($config->files->file as $value)
            echo 'id: '.$value->id.'<br></br>location: '.
                htmlspecialchars($value->location).'';
    ?>


If the /path/to/config.xml to substitute config1.xml, then everything works correctly. But if you substitute config2.xml error

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in D:\www\index.php on line 7


How can I iterate all items file, if their number is not known in advance (one or more than one)?

This issue is related to ZF-6109, but I create this clone issue because the original is set only for ZF version 1.7.7, but ZF version 1.9.2 still has the issue

The more important question is how do we solve this without breaking backwards compatibility?
