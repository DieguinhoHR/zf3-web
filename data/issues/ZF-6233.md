### Description

If the value "none" is put into a Zend config .ini file, it appears as an empty string once parsed. See [http://zend.com/forums/index.php/…](http://www.zend.com/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=8227&start=0&S=d3606279ef1a35586b20f45a2af65ea1) for an example of the problem.

This is an issue in PHP function parse\_ini\_file()

See comments in the PHP manual, [http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/…](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php#61960) [http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/…](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php#50741) [http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/…](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php#63573)

If this answers the problem you've been having please close the issue. :)

Thanks, /James
