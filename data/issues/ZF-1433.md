<a href="">www.php.net/hash</a>" rel="nofollow">The Hash extension requires no external libraries and is enabled by default as of PHP 5.1.2. Resolving as "not an issue," but please feel free to reopen with further details (e.g., PHP and OS versions) if you feel this is genuinely a problem with the ZF component.

Strange - I am not sure why this is enabled by default but not enabled on mine (5.2.1 - dev-lang/php-5.2.1-r3 (Gentoo)). Maybe the test could opt-out if the extension is not present?
