### Description

Zend\_Http\_Client throw an Zend\_Http\_Client\_Exception if the connection is timeout. I think this should be catched and retourned as error and isSuccesful() to be false

I Disagree.

The reason is that a Zend\_Http\_Response object is not instantiated (and should not be) if there is no _HTTP_ response.

Since there is no connection, there is no HTTP request and no HTTP response, so there cannot be a call to $response->isSuccessful() method.

$response->isSuccessful() / ->isError() etc. relate to the _HTTP_ response code, not to some networking or other related issues.

You should (and can, very easily) use try / catch in your code to make sure there are no networking issues.

If you think this should be further discussed, please submit to fw-webserives@lists.zend.com and take the discussion there, so everyone can participate.

I am closing this bug for now.
