ZF-4626: Zend\_View does not allow multiple helperPaths be assigned at instantiation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_View does not allow to pass it more than one helper path and helper prefix when instantiated with

new Zend\_View(array('helperPath' = '/path/to/helper/dir'))

Perhaps the class could check whether the key is an array and perform an iteration over the elements in that array to fix this

This can be done with like this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = new Zend_View();
    $view->addHelperPath('My/Helper', 'My_Helper');
