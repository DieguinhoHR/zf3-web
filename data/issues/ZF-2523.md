### Description

@version $Id: Inflector.php 7078 2007-12-11 14:29:33Z matthew $

Zend\_Filter\_Inflector method 'filter' needs at least one param ($source). If you define _only_ 'static' rules (without, for example, default ':' prefix) and set value to each one and you don't need to replace it with a $source array you should call 'filter' method without param.

Sure, as workaround you can call filter(null), filter(array()), ...

Actual code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function filter($source)
    {
        [...]
    }


Proposed code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function filter($source = null)
    {
        [...]
    }

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Can you supply a valid use case?

    <pre class="highlight">
    $sFilenameFormat = 'log%t.txt';
    $aFilenameFormatRules = array('t' => time());
    $zendInflector = new Zend_Filter_Inflector($sFilenameFormat, $aFilenameFormatRules);
    $zendInflector->setTargetReplacementIdentifier('%');
    echo $zendInflector->filter(null);

There is one problem with this suggestion.

It breaks the filter interface.

The filter interface defines one parameter to be in the filter method without a default value. So the proposed change can not be applied.

Erasing the interface would mean that you can't use this filter within other components... can't be done.

Changing the interface to allow optional parameters is also a problem as this would mean to change all existing and also all user-land filters.

Actually I see no way to allow

$inflector->filter();

@ralph: Your opinion ?

Closing as "won't fix".

Filters are converting/filtering input and create output. Therefor a filter needs to have a input.

Changing the interface would lead to inconsistency with other existing filters even userland filters. As there is no way to allow both, this issue is closed.
