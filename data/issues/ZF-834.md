### Description

It looks like an extra "else" was forgotten in the Zend\_Date setDst() method. Whatever the parameter is, the exception will always be thrown.

Here's a suggested fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">   /**
         * Sets a new DST value
         *   NULL  = Default behavior
         *   FALSE = Do not use summer/wintertime
         *   TRUE  = Use summer/wintertime
         */
        public function setDst($dst = null)
        {
            if ($dst === null) {
                $this->_DST = -1;
            } else if ($dst === false) {
                $this->_DST = 0;
            } else if ($dst === true) {
                $this->_DST = 1;
            } else {
                throw new Zend_Date_Exception("dst ($dst) has to be boolean or null", $dst);
            }
        }

The useage of DST is depreciated as with PHP 5.1 (see the PHP documentation for details).

It is therefor deleted for the new 0.8 branch. For details use the actual branch I18N-pre0.8 from SVN.

No DST or GMT functions are avaiable anymore... Instead timezones have to be used as this is the new PHP behaviour.
