### Description

I believe that Zend\_Mail could benefit from a couple fluent interface/method chaining improvements, most of the setters and add methods could be updated. I'm suggesting the following are considered:

setSubject() setReturnPath() setMimeBoundary() setFrom() addTo() addCc() addBcc() addHeader()

This was requested in ZF-564 and a patch uploaded but does not seem to be in the SVN trunk.

Thanks

Shaun

Will be resolving ZF-564 so this issue is redundant.
