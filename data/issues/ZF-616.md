### Description

The patch adds two new classes Lucene/Analysis/TokenFilter/ShortWords.php and Lucene/Analysis/TokenFilter/StopWords.php. The first class filters out short words (minimum length can be configured), the second one words from stop word list (it can be loaded from file or from an array).

The patch also adds support for "null tokens" to Lucene/Analysis/Analyzer/Common classes.

I've just applied patch and committed to SVN.

That would be good to update documentation and describe these new analyzers. :) documentation/manual/en/module\_specs/Zend\_Search-Extending.xml file, Text Analysis section.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.

I'd assign this to Lukas, but I can't find his name in the assignment list. :(
