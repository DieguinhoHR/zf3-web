### Description

In the following file:

en/module\_specs/Zend\_Http\_UserAgent-Features\_Wurfl.xml

In the section with ID "zend.http.user-agent-features-wurfl.methods", the refentry uses a duplicate ID

It uses "zend.http.user-agent-features.methods.get-from-request" but it should probably use something like "zend.http.user-agent-features-wfurl.methods.get-from-request"
