ZF-5956: Zend\_Paginator factory chokes when Zend\_Db\_Select has UNION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Lets say $select1 and $select2 are Zend\_Db\_Selects that give identical fields.

Then we do $select1 UNION $select2: $select = $db->select()->union(array($select1, $select2));

If we do: print\_r($this->\_db->fetchAll($select));

It will return arrays of the expected union of $select1 and $select2

But when we try to make our paginator: $paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select);

We get a crash: exception 'Zend\_Db\_Select\_Exception' with message 'No table has been specified for the FROM clause'

The expected result is no crash.

The workaround (inefficient) right now is just to give the factory the whole array: Zend\_Paginator::factory($this->\_db->fetchAll($select));

There is no assigned developer at the moment. Is this bug not critical?

Could you give me a simple use-case including:

- A simple UNION query
- A COUNT query, based on that UNION query.

This will help me greatly in formulating a patch.

Cheers,

Here are the two use-cases:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select1->from('user',array('firstname','lastname'));
    $select1->where('id = ?',1);
            
    $select2 = $this->db->select();
    $select2->from('user',array('firstname','lastname'));
    $select2->where('id = ?',2);
            
    $selectUnion = $this->db->select();    
    $selectUnion->union(array($select1,$select2));


Its hard to create a fast count with a union statement, i'm pretty sure this one is the slowest. Hopefully a database expert is watching this issue. ;-)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select1->from('user',array('firstname','lastname'));
    $select1->where('id = ?',1);
            
    $select2 = $this->db->select();
    $select2->from('user',array('firstname','lastname'));
    $select2->where('id = ?',2);
            
    $selectUnion = $this->db->select();    
    $selectUnion->union(array($select1,$select2));
    
    // Wrap a SELECT count(*) statement around the union 
    $selectCount = $this->db->select();     
    $selectCount->from($selectUnion,'count(*)');
    


Regards, Thorsten
