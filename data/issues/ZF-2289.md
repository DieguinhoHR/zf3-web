### Description

I think it would be interesting if it was possible to assign more than one assertion in the allow and deny methods (4th parameter). Or maybe a new method to add more assertions...

Of course you can implement a new Zend\_Acl\_Assert\_Interface class calling multiple asserts, but it's boring.

Thanx

I think that the proper solution is, as you suggested, to implement the assertion method... however you want, including assertion chains. This is actually quite trivial to do, and I don't see a compelling need to bloat the API with this. If you disagree, please feel free to reopen the issue with more feedback. Thank you! :)

OK, thanks.

I was implementing a new class (calling multiple asserts) for each combination of asserts in the application. Now, I realized it can be done by implementing a generic 'MultiAssert' class like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    class MultiAssert implements Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface {
    
        protected $_asserts;
    
        public function __construct(array $asserts) {
            foreach ($asserts as $assert) {
                Zend_Loader::autoload($assert);
                $this->_asserts[] = new $assert();
            }
        }
    
        public function assert(Zend_Acl $acl, Zend_Acl_Role_Interface $role = null,
                               Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface $resource = null, $privilege = null) {
            $result = TRUE;
            foreach ($this->_asserts as $assert) {
                $result &= $assert->assert($acl, $role, $resource, $privilege);
            }
            return $result ;
        }
    }
