### Description

This issue occurs when you have a key with upper case characteres like appOptions, and you try to use $this->getOption('appOptions') inside the Bootstrap.

It seems to be related to a missing strtolower on the method hasOption of the class Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract.

As so, I think the method hasOption should be changed to include return in\_array(strtolower($key), $this->\_optionKeys); this way the getOption method will behave the same way on both Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract and Zend\_Application, as expected.

This issue seams related to ZF-7742, where the same fix has been applied Zend\_Application for solving a similar issue (and should have been applied also to Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract

As far as I know this affects all releases of ZF.

A simple workaround is to override the hasOption method when extending Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrap.
