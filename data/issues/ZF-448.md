### Description

The SQLite backend needs to cleanup the database to recover wasted space and address structure/data fragmentation issues. The automaticCleaningFactor > 0 leaves the database size the same even after all the rows are deleted from the cache table. Inserts and deletes can leave the database file structure fragmented, which slows down disk access to the database contents. For > 100 rows, this results in a large file size that gets accessed for every page load. Use VACUUM or PRAGMA auto\_vacuum to address this situation:

[http://www.sqlite.org/lang\_vacuum.html](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) [http://sqlite.org/pragma.html/#pragma\_auto\_vacuum](http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum)

VACUUM could be offered as an additional configuration option (ALONG WITH AN AUTOMATIC-VACUUMING-FACTOR OPTION , if possible :-)

Thanks,

I just commited an automatic VACUUM system in SVN.

Can you try it ?

It introduces a new backend option :

 \* ====> (int) automaticVacuumFactor : \* - Disable / Tune the automatic vacuum process \* - The automatic vacuum process defragment the database file (and make it smaller) \* when a clean() or delete() is called \* 0 => no automatic vacuum \* 1 => systematic vacuum (when delete() or clean() methods are called) \* x (integer) > 1 => automatic vacuum randomly 1 times on x clean() or delete()

thanks

It doesn't work. I guess the \_automaticVacuum() method should read:

 
    private function _automaticVacuum() 
    {
        if ( ! $this->_options['automaticVacuumFactor'] )
            return;
        //
        $rand = 1;      // Default init for 'automaticVacuumFactor' = 1
        //
        if ($this->_options['automaticVacuumFactor'] > 1)
            $rand = rand(1, $this->_options['automaticVacuumFactor']);
        //
        if ($rand == 1)
            @sqlite_query($this->_db, 'VACUUM');
    }

But I currently have no way to test in a multi-user/heavy-load environment. The documentation on VACUUM states it fails if there is an active transaction but states it differently on PRAGMA VACUUM.

Thanks,

the following example works for me

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    <?php 
    
    require_once 'Zend/Cache.php';
    
    $frontendOptions = array(
        'lifeTime' => 7200 // cache lifetime of 2 hours
    );
    
    $backendOptions = array(
        'cacheDBCompletePath' => '/tmp/toto.db',
        'automaticVacuumFactor' => 1
    );
    
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'Sqlite', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    
    /*for ($i=0;$i<1000;$i++) {
        $cache->save((string) $i, (string) $i);
        echo($i);
    }*/
    
    $cache->clean();
    
    ?>
