ZF-8014: Set Request parameters automatically (on request) as global parameters for Router

### Description

Suppose you have a page /article/view/:id/ on the same page you also have the links /article/delete/:id/ , /article/print/:id/ , /article/edit/:id/ , /article/email/:id/ which are generated by Zend\_Navigation. Now it's kinda irritating I need to set the id manually to these links, esp. since they're generated through Zend\_Navigation or call \_Router::setGlobalParam myself each time. Therefore I propose this patch (attached to this issue) which does this automatically. If accepted, methods to dis-/enable this feature, and an option to the router resource plugin will be added.

Redid patch. Included unittests and everything.

All unittests pass, implying that no BC is broken (I am not aware of any either).

Have you run the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Url, Zend\_View\_Helper\_Url, and Zend\_Navigation tests with your patch applied?

I have now. All Zend\_Controller, Zend\_View and Zend\_Navigation tests pass. Except for testLocalTranslationObjectIsPreferredOverRegistry(Zend\_View\_Helper\_TranslateTest), but that should be unrelated (pretty sure it is).
