### Description

2 same queries with uppercase and lowercase "and" operator

 
    <pre class="highlight">$sql = new \Zend\Db\Sql\Sql($dbAdapter);
    echo $sql->select()->from('table1')
        ->join('table2', 'table1.id = table2.table1_id and table2.field2', array(), 'left')
        ->getSqlString();
    echo $sql->select()->from('table1')
        ->join('table2', 'table1.id = table2.table1_id AND table2.field2', array(), 'left')
        ->getSqlString();


 
    <pre class="highlight">SELECT "table1".* FROM "table1" LEFT JOIN "table2" ON "table1"."id" = "table2"."table1_id" "and" "table2"."field2"
    SELECT "table1".* FROM "table1" LEFT JOIN "table2" ON "table1"."id" = "table2"."table1_id" AND "table2"."field2"

Same to "or|between" operators.

Operators "in", "not in", "like" and others quoted a case-insensitive
