### Description

most of INSTALL.md is not fix for zf2 [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/…](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

- update zf2 git repository to <a>git://github.com/zendframework/zf2.git</a>
- remove Zend\_Tool notes
- add notes for Environment (eg. func\_overload) [http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/…](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/Environment-amp-StringUtils-td4559272.html)
- include\_path & autoload setting (include\_path still requires Zend\\Code tests & PEAR's Archive\_Tar loading) <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2069>
