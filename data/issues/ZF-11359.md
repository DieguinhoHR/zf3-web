Patch: <http://pastie.org/1886576>

Note that getDefaults is not a part of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Interface, so the method\_exists check is necessary. Also, Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain does not implement getDefaults, but I think that should be possible.

As mentioned above this patch does not work for chained routes. I patched this issue by comparing the assembled URLs of the current route and the route used by Zend\_Navigation\_Page\_Mvc:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->_route) {
        /*
         * Patch ZF-11359
         * For Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Chain
         */
        try {
            if ($front->getRouter()->getCurrentRouteName() === $this->_route && $this->getHref() === self::$_urlHelper->url(array(), null, false, false)) {
                $this->_active = true;
                return true;
            }
        } catch (Zend_Controller_Router_Exception $e) {
        }
    
    
        /**
         * Patch ZF-11359
         * ZF-11359_Fix_Patch.diff
         */
        $route = $front->getRouter()->getRoute($this->_route);
        if(method_exists($route, 'getDefaults')) {
            $myParams = array_merge($route->getDefaults(), $myParams);
        }
    }

I guess would worth to check if the route is chained and only use the patch for a chained route.

This makes sense to avoid too much assemble processing....

This issue was assigned to me because it was about merely applying a patch. Apparently the patch does not meet the quality standards ZF aims at. I am reassigning the issue, and assume it will not be resolved before ZF2.

Of course, this is not the case if a patch shows up that also supports chained links in a performant manner. Thank you for making ZF better!

Freeaqingme, i suggest to at least patch with the initial solution, which works for non-chained routes. Otherwise it makes sense to fully remove the isActive related features...

I mean, there is a solution which is fixing for at least many of the cases so it makes sense to either apply the patch or remove the features (which i don't think is a choice would lead to BC break).

Applied original patch(es). They should be released with version 1.11.8.

Committed in r24118 merged with release 1.11 branch in r24119. For the chained route stuff, please create a new issue.

Thank you for making ZF better.

Thanks Freeaqingme.

I raised a new issue for the chained routes case:
