### Description

Hi,

There's some mistakes in Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap and Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Pop3. First of all, in the Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap class documentation, it says that the default port is 110 : it's false, the default standard port for the IMAP protocol is 143. By the way, in both classes, the default port is set to 'null'.

Regards

My bad, ports are well defined in the Protocol classes. Editing for documentation labeled.
