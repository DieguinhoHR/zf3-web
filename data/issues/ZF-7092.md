### Description

Having a method in the HTTP request object to get the client's IP would be really useful. Proposed method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function getClientIp()
    {
        if (!empty($this->getServer('HTTP_CLIENT_IP'))) {
            $ip = $this->getServer('HTTP_CLIENT_IP');
        } else if (!empty($this->getServer('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'))) {
            $ip = $this->getServer('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR');
        } else {
            $ip = $this->getServer('REMOTE_ADDR');
        }
    
        return $ip;
    }

Assigning back to Jurrien, as he knows the implementation desired. :) Please don't forget to write tests for the functionality. :)
