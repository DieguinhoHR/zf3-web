### Description

In the issue tracker, there is no obvious way to change the password.

In particular, there is no change password link or information on:

- the profile page - [http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/ViewProfile.jspa)
- the update user preferences page - [http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/UpdateUserPreferences!default.jspa)

Resolving as duplicate, and keeping the later ZF-7983 as it has additional comments.
