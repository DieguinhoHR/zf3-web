ZF1 standardizes on the PHPUnit 3.4 series; these deprecation notices were introduced during the PHPUnit 3.5 series. (ZF2 uses PHPUnit 3.5, and we're steadily updating these assertions.)

I thought I submitted this bug for ZF2. I also submitted a patch updating the assertions for ZF2. I created this bug in order to have a branch name to pull request for.

[https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/313/files)

Did I do this incorrectly?

My bad -- I missed the ZF2- prefix!

BTW, this route may or may not exist once refactoring of the MVC is done. The reason is that it may be easier to handle the request-method-specific items within the controller itself rather than in the routing. This allows using literal route matching, which will be much faster, and also more flexible for cases of subresources, etc.

That said, I'll still honor the pull request.

Awesome,

I was worried I had done something wrong. This is the first time I've publicly contributed to a project, and was using this ticket as my first try and working with a setup like this. I picked the easiest thing I could quickly find, just to get familiar with the process.

The pull request for this one <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/313> was merged and closed, so I'm resolving this one as fixed. Also, the Zend/Rest tests are all green.
