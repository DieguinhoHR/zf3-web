### Description

Unless, I'm mistake when fixing bug ZF-11546 in the 1.11.9 release, Zend\_Translate lost the ability to create locales from a directory structure as it did in 1.11.8.

I tested a fix which is to change lines 248-253 in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter.php to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
        new RecursiveRegexIterator(
            new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($options['content'], RecursiveDirectoryIterator::KEY_AS_PATHNAME),
            '/^(?!.*(\.svn|\.cvs)).*$/', RecursiveRegexIterator::MATCH
        ),
        RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST
    );


It's just adding back RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF\_FIRST.

This keeps the same behavior as 1.11.8, without going through .svn and .cvs directories.

Hello Bob,

Thanks for the patch to contribute to ZF, but I notice that you don't appear to have a CLA on file, if you do, you should get in touch with Ralph Schindler and ask him to assign you the correct groups so that you can attach patches as an attachment rather than inline, otherwise, you should sign the cla ([http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Contributor+License+Agreement)) and return it before contributing code, otherwise your contributions may go unused!

This already was done in [r24267](http://framework.zend.com/code/diff.php?repname=Zend+Framework&path=/standard/branches/release-1.11/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php&rev=r24267) and is in next mini release.

Greetings Ramon

This issue is a duplication of ZF-11567 and was already fixed
