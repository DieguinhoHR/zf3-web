### Description

When I'm trying to store into index my data it returns the following errors:

1).**Notice**: Undefined offset: 78573 in **...Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php** on line **165**

public function getField($fieldNum) { return $this->\_fields [$fieldNum]; // row number 165 of SegmentInfo.php }

2). **Notice**: Trying to get property of non-object in **...Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentMerger.php** on line **72**

 
    private function _mergeStoredFields() {
        ....
        if (! ($bits & 2)) {
            $storedFields [] = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Field ( $fieldInfo->name, $fdtFile->readString (), 'UTF-8', true, $fieldInfo->isIndexed, $bits & 1 ); // row number 72 of SegmentMerger.php
        } else {
            $storedFields [] = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Field ( $fieldInfo->name, $fdtFile->readBinary (), '', true, $fieldInfo->isIndexed, $bits & 1, true );
        }
        .....
        }


3). **Notice**: Trying to get property of non-object in **...Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentWriter.php** on line **55**

 
    public function addStoredFields($storedFields) {
        .....
        foreach ( $storedFields as $field ) {
            $this->_fdtFile->writeVInt ( $this->_fields [$field->name]->number ); // row number 55 of SegmentWriter.php
        .....
        }


4). **Fatal error**: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 1335492579 bytes

) in **...Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/File/Filesystem.php** on line

**50**

 
    protected function _fread($length = 1) {
        .....
        while ( $length > 0 && ($nextBlock = fread ( $this->_fileHandle, $length )) != false ) { //row number 50 of Filesystem.php
        .....
        }


I don't know how allowed memory size is exhausted... My index size is only 270Kb. I didn't notice such troubles on previous versions (1.5.1) of ZF. OS: Linux 2.6.18-53.el5 #1 SMP Mon Nov 12 02:14:55 EST 2007 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux (CentOS 5.1). php 5.2.6.

Maybe this because of using APC?

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Hi, I noticed that indexing fails only for non-empty index.

For example if do this way

foreach($items as $item) {

 
     new $doc = ZFLD();...
     $index->addDoc($doc);...


}

$index->commit(); $index->optimize();

That's work great. Tried to index over 1 Mb.

But if i would add values to existing index and call commit and optimize(tried to switch it off) it fails.

i got exactly the same problem here i'm still trying add all documments and then commit, but i got too much documments and some large ones, so maybe i got memory problems too

but this means that each new documment i get i would have to index all of them again?

Should be fixed in newer ZF versions
