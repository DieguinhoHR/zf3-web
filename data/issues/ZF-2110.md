### Description

If a date header is not set while assembling the message it needs to be added before sending.

From: KyleMac [nabble@deletethetrees.com](mailto:nabble@deletethetrees.com) Subject: Re: [fw-general] Zend\_Mail

I was just looking into this missing date header thing since it caused a few emails to bounce. From what I can tell, the MTA is under no obligation to add the date header and in Exim it's considered a "fixup" (or rather, not doing it is called suppressing fixups). Short story; if your MTA adds it then it's being kind, if not then it's your fault for not doing it yourself.

Considering the date header is meant to be a requirement, I think that maybe it deserves at least a mention in the ZF manual, maybe it's own addDate() method and probably to be added automatically by Zend\_Mail.

From RFC 2822: "[The origination date specifies] the time at which the human or other creator of the message has put the message into its final form, ready for transport."

Attached a patch that adds new setDate()/getDate() methods. If a date is not set before send()ing, it's automatically set.

Nico, will you have time to get to this by the PR code freeze (1/22)?

Thanks Jordan for the patch. It's added to trunk, with some modifications and should be fully tested (don't have xdebug installed here).
