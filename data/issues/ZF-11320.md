ZF-11320: Zend\_Mail stripping out email addresses when reading email using IMAP or POP3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When reading a message using Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Imap or Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Pop3, I am unable to see any from addresses and most to addresses. This can be seen in the raw headers that it outputs. I don't know enough about the underlying protocols to debug but am happy to run tests if that would help narrow down the cause.

Also, I know that this information is contained in the emails (they aren't corrupted or anything) because I was able to connect to the same server using IMAP in Thunderbird and view all of the information including email addresses.

I ran another test on this today and I was able to view the email addresses. I think maybe it was a server configuration issue. You can close this ticket.

I'm experiencing this issue. My environment is: Debian Squeeze Apache2.2 PHP/5.3.3-7+squeeze1 CakePHP + Zend Framework Zend\_Mail

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // $message instanceof Zend_Mail_Part
    $recipient = implode($message->getHeader('to', 'array'));
    
    // $recipient never contains the email address found in the less than '<', greater than '>' brackets.


For example, if the header contains [doug@somedomain.com](mailto:doug@somedomain.com) then I get nothing. Or if it contains "Doug R" [doug@somedomain.com](mailto:doug@somedomain.com) then I get "Doug R"

Corey said it is a server config issue. Could you tell me what can be changed in the environment to fix this?

Thanks.

Unfortunately I don't know-- I'm not in control of the server. It would be really nice to know what is causing this bug though, in case it happens again.

Ok, think i've found it.

Trick is that CakePHP developers have done their job and prevent somebody malicious entering in nefarious tags by cutting out anything with '<' and '>' in it. Basically anything that looks like a tag is removed. The headers are saved to the DB but stripped out when retrieved.

Definitely not a Zend\_Mail bug.

If anyone wanders into this that's using CakePHP, the relevant section is highlighted in yellow at the top of this page: [http://book.cakephp.org/view/1183/â€¦](http://book.cakephp.org/view/1183/Data-Sanitization)
