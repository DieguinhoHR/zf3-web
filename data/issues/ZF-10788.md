### Description

in order to prevent damaging charset while usnig Zend\_Dom\_Query please see below. It happens that you experience wrong characters even if the document is UTF-8 and you specified this encoding when you creted your Zend\_Dom\_Query instance. The problem is in Zend\_Dom\_Query::queryXpath() method on line

$domDoc->loadHTML($document);

If your html has meta tag written like this: it might have garbage in latter dom queries in output. To fix that there is a "hack" mentioned here : [http://ru.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://ru.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.loadhtml.php#95251). To fix one can change the mentioned above line to:

$domDoc->loadHTML('<?xml encoding="'.$encoding.'">' .$document);
