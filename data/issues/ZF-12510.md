### Description

When trying to retrieve the year part of a Zend\_Date, the constants Zend\_Date::YEAR and Zend\_Date::YEAR\_SHORT return each others value.

Code sample:

$today = new Zend\_Date(); // assume it is 2013-01-18 11:00:00 $year = $today->get(Zend\_Date::YEAR); // $year should be "2013", it is "13" $shortYear = $today->get(Zend\_Date::YEAR\_SHORT); // $yearShort should be "13", it is "2013"

Hi Mário, I can not reproduce your problem. All unit tests are okay.

Here is a test for your example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testDateShouldMatchLongAndShortYear()
    {
        $date = new Zend_Date('31.12.2007');
    
        $this->assertEquals('2007', $date->get(Zend_Date::YEAR));
        $this->assertEquals('07', $date->get(Zend_Date::YEAR_SHORT));
    }


_Result: OK_

You are right, there was a piece of information missing that I overlooked.

This behaviour only occurs when you set the 'format' option of Zend\_Date to 'php'. I was setting it in the bootstrap and overlooked it in the test code I supplied.

I created an empty project just to test this and found the following: if I use Zend\_Date::setOptions(array('format\_type' => 'php')), then I get the results I said above. If I do not set that Zend\_Date option, then the calls to get work as expected.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // no call to Zend_Date::setOptions();
    $today = new Zend_Date();
    $year = $today->get(Zend_Date::YEAR); // returns full 4 digit year
    $shortYear = $today->get(Zend_Date::YEAR_SHORT); // returns 2 digit year


but

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array('format_type' => 'php'));
    $today = new Zend_Date();
    $year = $today->get(Zend_Date::YEAR); // returns 2 digit year
    $shortYear = $today->get(Zend_Date::YEAR_SHORT); // returns full 4 digit year


Is this an expected behaviour? I've been browsing the documentation and it does not say anything about Zend\_Date::get() behaviour changing with or without this option.
