### Description

Using var\_export instead of var\_dump with output buffering is a much cleaner solution.

Var\_export's notation is totally different from that of var\_dump(). Imho var\_dump's output is much easier to debug than that of var\_export(). Proposing to close as wont-fix.

I also propose closing this as wont-fix however, for the same reasons as mentioned by Dolf, + this from Remi Woler:

Var\_export uses \_\_set\_state to be able to restore objects from the dump code. It handles recursion differently, and catches it earlier because of the \_\_set\_state.

Closing, 2 months with no update.
