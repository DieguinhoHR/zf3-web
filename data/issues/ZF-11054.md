### Description

When upgrading from ZF 1.10.3 to 1.11.3 you get error "Undefined index: tag in /share/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 454" This happens when creating a Zend\_Translate() object.

Solution: Delete the Zend\_Cache files (like this: zend\_cache---internal-metadatas---Zend\_Translate\_03b14de33d0478a9a5f375fe6bee6586\_Tmx) to force the cache to be rebuild

I'm closing this as not an issue.

The change from 1.10.x to 1.11.x does contain some minor bc breaks, and clearing the cache is a perfectly sufficient workaround for this.
