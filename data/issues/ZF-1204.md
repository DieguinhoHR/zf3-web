### Description

David Koblas writes:

Was doing some work with the base DB implementation and had the following suggestion...

Currrently (paraphrasing the doc example) to do an update you would have the following code.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update(
        'round_table',
        array(
            'favorite_color' => 'yellow',
        ), 
        $db->quoteInto('first_name = ?', 'Robin')
    );


It would be nice if update() could take a mixed third parameter so that you could write both the above statement (with lots of LIKEs and other exprs) or it could take an array - yeilding:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update(
        'round_table',
        array(
            'favorite_color' => 'yellow',
        ),
        array(
            'first_name' => 'Robin',
        )
    );


Thus making it easier to do basic updates for keyed records, it would addtionally be handy to have it take an array for IN query sets.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->update(
        'round_table',
        array(
            'favorite_color' => 'yellow',
        ), 
        array(
            'first_name' => array('Robin', 'Joan', 'Julia'),
        )
    );


--koblas

ps. It would be nice to have it apply to delete()

Updated priority to minor, since easy workaround is possible. Also affects Zend\_Db.
