### Description

When using Zend\_Mail with the SMTP transport talking to a postfix mail server that is configured with strict\_mime\_encoding\_domain = true sending multipart messages will fail. The posfix configration option seems to block mails from "from poorly written software" as the postfix manual states. It seems that the postfix mailserver has a problem when the content-transfer encoding and the content-disposistion fields where set in the mail header. If I removed them the mail transmission did work.

My current work-a-round is to extend Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp and overwrite the \_getHeaders method with:

protected function \_getHeaders($boundary) { parent::\_getHeaders($boundary);

 
    if (null !== $boundary) {
        unset($this->_headers['Content-Transfer-Encoding']);
        unset($this->_headers['Content-Disposition']);
    }
    
    return $this->_headers;


}

Please have a look at that issue and provide a better fix.
