### Description

Hi there

\\Zend\\Config\\Factory::fromFile does not manage 'sections' for ini files ?

How can i get config for my section "mysection" ?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = \Zend\Config\Factory::fromFile($myinifile);
    \Zend\Debug::dump($config);
    
    returns
    array(14) {
      ["default"] => array(1) {
        ["application_upload_directory"] => string(6) "upload"
      }
      ["en : default"] => array(0) {
      }
      ["fr : default"] => array(0) {
      }
      ["mysection : en"] => array(1) {
        ["keywords"] => array(1) {
          [0] => string(4) "test"
        }
      }
    ...
    }

The concept of sections and inheritance was not carried over into Zend\\Config 2.0. There are a few different approaches you can take instead (having multiple files merged over eachother by e.g. using fromFiles() and globbing, or, for your INI example, have an @include of a base config in the top each specific file and override specific values afterwards. For more help/information on this topic, check the mailing list or #zftalk.2 on irc.freenode.org.

Ok Thank you Ben. But i'm using a multi sites application and each section of my config file is a domain name (about 10 domains) so i don't want to create 10 config files per module. [toto.com : fr] [titi.net: en] ...

So i made of copy of Zend\\Config from zf2beta2 to my own component library and i'm using it instead of the new config system.
