### Description

Please ignore => Warning is not issued because of rendering headTitle(). Problem is that headTitle()->toValue does nor terung string but (logically) an array if multiple titles have been set.

Please close issue.

If I append two or more strings to $this->view->headTitle() I get the following warning on display

Warning: htmlspecialchars() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /opt/lampp/htdocs/library/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 804

Controller: $this->view->headTitle( 'aap' ); $this->view->headTitle( 'noot' );

View-script <?= $this->headTitle() ?>
