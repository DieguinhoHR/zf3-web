### Description

The construct method of Zend\_Validate\_PostCode is missing a default value for the $options parameter, seeing as it checks if (null === $options) I would suggest adding '= null' to the constructor so that nothing needs to be passed over if you intend to fetch the locale from the registry.

- public function \_\_construct($options)
- - public function \_\_construct($options = null)
