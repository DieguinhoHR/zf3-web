### Description

I believe that the dirname returns an invalid path at this code snippet (in public function get($redirectMax = 5), \\Zend\\Client.php)

- - - - - -


                        } else {
                            // Split into path and query and set the query
                            list($headerValue, $query) = explode('?', $headerValue, 2);
                            $this->_uri->setQueryString($query);
    
                            if (strpos($headerValue, '/') === 0) {
                                // If we got just an absolute path, set it
                                $this->_uri->setPath($headerValue);
    
                            } else {
                                // Else, assume we have a relative path


1 -> $path = dirname($this->\_uri->getPath()); $path .= ($path == '/' ? $headerValue : "/{$headerValue}" ); 2-> $this->\_uri->setPath($path); }

 }

Im running Apache 2.2.2 , PHP 5.1.4 on a Windows Xp desktop.

I used Zend\_Http\_Client($url) with $url = '<http://www.gratis-ting.dk>'. Then the code line in question from the snippet (1) returns '\\' instead of '/' and therefore later giving and error at (2)

Fixed the bug by doing as follows: $path = dirname($this->\_uri->getPath()); 1-> $path = str\_replace('\\', '/', $path); $path .= ($path == '/' ? $headerValue : "/{$headerValue}" ); $this->\_uri->setPath($path);

Hope this could help

Hi,

Can you please check if this problem still occurs with the incubator version of the Http\_Client? It was completely rewritten, and many bugs were fixed.

Thanks.

I tested the code on Windows and didn't encounter such problem.

Setting to fix - please reopen if you encounter it with the new (incubator) client.
