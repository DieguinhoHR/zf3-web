ZF-3834: Details on View Paths when using Modular Structure

### Description

Currently the documentation says nothing on how view paths are set when using a modular structure in "section 7.11. Using a Conventional Modular Directory Structure" just in the ViewRenderer section. Its not obvious that the ViewRenderer is responsible for all the settings in the Modular Structure section, so clarification what the ViewRenderer does in a Modular Directory structure would tie the dependancies together and one would find the related stuff faster.
