ZF-2345: Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer fails to identify OpenId server element when attributes are single-quoted

### Description

The regular expression which Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer uses to find the element in the discovery response currently requires the attribute values in that element to be double-quoted (Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer, lines 618-626). This makes sense given the XML underpinnings of most modern HTML, as attribute values in XML are _required_ to be double-quoted.

However, since OpenID can be implemented by anyone on any server, it stands to reason that it might be implemented by developers who are not familiar with this requirement. A good case in point is the blog I recently started on Wordpress.com. The OpenID element used in Wordpress.com blogs single-quotes its attribute values; this behavior does not appear to be modifiable, and it looks like it would affect a lot of users.

I would like to propose modifying the regular expression to allow for single-quoted attribute values, so as to avoid unpleasant login errors in these kinds of situations.
