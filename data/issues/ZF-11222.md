### Description

Hi,

I use the Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress to validate email addresses for my email program. About three days ago the validator failed the following email addresses :

test@test.co. test@test.co.za. etc Note the full stop at the end.

Today I find that the validator passes these email addresses which is obviously wrong.

Is this a bug?

Regards

The question is: What have you changed? When the code is the same and also the settings are the same then the change must be eigther related to the used input or to the response from the network on the MX request when this is configured to be used.
