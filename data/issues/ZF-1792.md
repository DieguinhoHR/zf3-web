### Description

Kudos to all the fine folks that have made this really nifty framework! :)

I have been working at hacking in a templating system ('smarty'), a layout mechanism, and an alternate rendering system for a project I'm working on. It seems to me that this ought to be a relatively straightforward procedure. Win-win type of thing-- use the Zend framework to get its plethora of modules and functionality, and extend / bend / whatever it a bit to add in the functionality I want without having to carve up the base framework. But when I try to use the 'setParam()' and 'getParam()' methods of the controller, I find they are not passing references but rather copies (or more accurately, copy-on-write copies) and so are not useful for storing references to external data. Ie. I cannot create an array and store it in the controller using 'setParam()' and be able to modify the original later. This creates problems because if I then (somewhere else down the road) retrieve the variable from the controller using 'getParam()', all I get is a copy (copy-on-write) version of the variable and any changes I make to it are not saved in the original. (Though I suppose it would be possible to get the variable, make the changes and then re-store it). What I propose however are two new functions specifically to provide this functionality: 'setParamByRef()' and 'getParamByRef()' which would offer the developer his/her choice of methods. Which would simplify passing external data references through the framework.

Furthermore I suggest that if any other modules (classes) use this sort of set/get Param interface that they too be modified to include a set/get by reference version.

Sample code:

 
        public function setParamByRef ($name, &$value) {
                $name = (string) $name;
                $this->_invokeParams[$name] = $value;
                return $this;
                }
    
        public function & getParamByRef ($name) {
                if (isset($this->_invokeParams[$name])) {
                        return $this->_invokeParams[$name];
                        }
                return null;
                }

Assigning to [~matthew] to initiate issue review.

A typo in the code posted above, this should be right:

 
        public function setParamByRef ($name, &$value) {
                $name = (string) $name;
                $this->_invokeParams[$name] =& $value;
                return $this;
                }
    
        public function & getParamByRef ($name) {
                $ret = null;
                if (isset($this->_invokeParams[$name])) {
                        return $this->_invokeParams[$name];
                        }
                return $ret;
                }

When working with smarty, you need to write your own wrappers as it is anyways, so you can add methods to your view implementation to do this. Not a ZF issue.
