ZF-8171: addHelperPath/setHelperPath prefix not working in view scripts

### Description

If I set a custom helper path and prefix in my Bootstrap class using the Zend\_View->setHelperPath() or Zend\_View->addHelperPath() functions then I'm unable to use custom helpers anywhere except in layout files (eg. layouts/layout.phtml). As far as I can tell, the prefix (eg. My\_) is left blank if calling the helper from any file except the layout file.

I've recreated this bug in versions 1.9.4 and 1.9.5 but haven't tested earlier versions.

I've created a small project demonstrating this bug: <http://include-digital.com/bug.tar> (_note_, you'll have to add your own Zend library to the library/ directory).

I can work around this problem by calling the Zend\_View->setHelperPath() or Zend\_View->addHelperPath() functions directly before I use a custom helper with the parameters I need, but this isn't an ideal solution.

Thanks for your sterling efforts so far!

Resolving as incomplete due to a lack of reproduction code.
