### Description

We found that there seems to be a bug in Zend\_Session which causes Zend\_Session to fail if PHP magic quotes are turned on in a \*nix environment. The error that's reported is: Fatal error: Cannot use object of type Zend\_Session\_Namespace as array in C:\\AppServ\\www\\httpdocs\\library\\Zend\\Session\\Abstract.php on line 159

This also happens in \*nix environment when register\_globals is on

Aside from magic\_quotes and register\_globals on being terrible ideas, Ill have a look into this to see whats triggering it.

within 2 weeks.

Cannot reproduce this, can you provide both the PHP version as well as the code snippet to demonstrate this usage? Reopen if you can reproduce.
