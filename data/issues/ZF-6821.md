### Description

No example of:

SELECT \* FROM table WHERE id IN (1,2,3)

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html#zend.db.select.building.where)

googling gives us this link:

[http://zfforums.com/zend-framework-components-13/…](http://www.zfforums.com/zend-framework-components-13/databases-20/where-statement-2398.html)

which is wrong for the latest version.
