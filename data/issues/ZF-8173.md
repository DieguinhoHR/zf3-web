ZF-8173: ZendX\_Console\_Process\_Unix and safemod restrictions on /tmp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

System temp directory inaccessible for me, So I need to use my own path to /tmp dir. {quote} Warning: realpath() [function.realpath]: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid is 32263 is not allowed to access /tmp owned by uid 0 {quote}

I changed code in methods \_createIpcSegment and \_createIpcSemaphore from

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $this->_ipcSemFile = realpath(sys_get_temp_dir()) . '/' . rand() . $this->_name . '.sem';


to

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ($this->_tempDirPath === NULL) {
        $tempPath = realpath(sys_get_temp_dir());
    } else {
        $tempPath = realpath($this->_tempDirPath);
    }
    $this->_ipcSemFile =  $tempPath . '/' . rand() . $this->_name . '.sem';


so childs can easily change path to temp directory by just overriding property \_temp\_dir\_path. May be better solution is setting this property in the constructor

Ps: sorry for my english.
