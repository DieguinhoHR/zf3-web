ZF-9186: Issue with dailogContainer and autoOpen function
---------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-02-16T03:33:22.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-04-16T00:20:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Curiously, everything works with the dialogContainer except the autoOpen function.

'autoOpen' => 'false' sends back to javascript "autoOpen":"false" and it doesn't work but 'autoOpen' => 0 seems to be ok (because we have "autoOpen":0)

the others functions work like a charm (model, height, title), don't know why ...

You have to use true/false values, not enclosed by a string, such:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array('autoOpen' => true);
