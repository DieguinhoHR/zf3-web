### Description

Two days ago i downloaded Release 1.6.0 to test the Zend\_Soap\_Client. The code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$Options = array( 'soap\_version' => SOAP\_1\_2, 'encoding' => 'ISO-8859-1' ); $Client = new Zend\_Soap\_Client('../server/soap\_test.wsdl', $Options);

$Response = $Client->get\_echo('test');
---------------------------------------

crashed (under XP / Apache 2.2 / PHP5.2.6)

The code
--------

$Client = new SoapClient('../server/soap\_test.wsdl', $Options);

$Response = $Client->\_\_call('get\_echo', array('test'));
----------------------------------------------------------

did work.

I found that Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common::\_\_doRequest(...) was called (on $this->\_soapClient member of Zend\_Soap\_Client), this one called Zend\_Soap\_Client::\_doRequest(...) which again called Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common::\_\_doRequest(...) (I think, the base call SoapClient::\_\_doRequest(...) was indented?) and so on.

I am not so familar with the architecture to locate the reason for this.

From code comments i guess something like this is intended:

1) Add new function \_doRequest to Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    function _doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $one_way)
    {
        if ($one_way == null) {
            return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version);
        } else {
            return parent::__doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $one_way);
        }
    }


2) Change Zend\_Soap\_Client::\_doRequest function to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function _doRequest(Zend_Soap_Client_Common $client, $request, $location, $action, $version, $one_way = null)
    {
        // Perform request as is
        return $client->_doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version, $one_way);
    }


In this way extensions of Zend\_Soap\_Client can do some work ( in overwriting Zend\_Soap\_Client:: \_doRequest(...) ), before the actual soap call is done. Eliminating Zend\_Soap\_Client\_Common:: \_\_doRequest(...) will undo this, because then SoapClient:: \_\_doRequest(...) will be called immediately.

Best reagrds, Bernd Schuler

    <pre class="highlight">
    call_user_func(array($client, 'SoapClient::__doRequest'), $request, $location, $action, $version);


Cool, i didn't yet know this syntax in PHP to call base methods of extension classes.

Thanks, Bernd Schuler

Thanks for the report and detailed problem research!

A bit shoter way to fix: {panel} return $client->\_\_doRequest($request, $location, $action, $version); {panel} ---> {panel} return call\_user\_func(array($client,'SoapClient::\_\_doRequest'), $request, $location, $action, $version); {panel}

It directly calls necessary method.
