ZF-2571: Provide ability to configure Zend\_Ldap and Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap post-instantiation

### Description

Zend\_Ldap and Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Ldap both have constructors that optionally expect an $options parameter, but there is no way to configure the instances after they have been instantiated.

This should be remedied, perhaps through providing {g,s}etOptions() methods or similar for each class.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
