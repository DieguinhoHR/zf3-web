### Description

Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php Line: 747: The url in the digest header is also urlencoded. Therefore when making comparison between the requested Uri and the Uri in the digest header, the latter should be urldecoded.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               // Make sure the path portion of both URIs is the same
                if ($rUri['path'] != $cUri['path']) {
                    return false;
                }
    
    


Should become:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               // Make sure the path portion of both URIs is the same
                if ($rUri['path'] != urldecode($cUri['path'])) {
                    return false;
                }


Try with files/directories named like this one: /resource-%e2%82%ac
