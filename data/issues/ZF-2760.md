### Description

I am setting the doctype like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyApp_Controller_Plugin_Init extends Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract 
    {
        public function dispatchLoopStartup() 
        {
            $viewRenderer = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('viewRenderer');
    
            $viewRenderer->view->doctype('XHTML1_TRANSITIONAL');
        }
    }


Then attaching that to the front controller in my bootstrap.

If I then try to use just...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->doctype(); ?>


...in my layout file (using Zend\_Layout) it causes issues with the W3C validator, getting a "This page is not Valid (no Doctype found)!" result, whereas re-specifying the doctype in the layout...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php echo $this->doctype('XHTML1_TRANSITIONAL'); ?>


...passes validation.

I can't recreate this using current trunk (r8496)... My milage is that the doctype helper is working fine.

I can confirm that it's also working fine for me too now. Just to add a few more details: I tested this with both XHTML1\_TRANSITIONAL and XHTML1\_STRICT and was testing the pages using the Firefox Web Developer Extension "Validate Local HTML". The tested pages were on a local server and a live production server. Clearly there was room for more errors to creep in with the testing process itself so it's probably worth closing this.
