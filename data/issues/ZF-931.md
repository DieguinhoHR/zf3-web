### Description

I get following warning: Warning: Illegal offset type in isset or empty in D:\\workspace\\webd\\core\\include\\library\\com.zend.framework\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\Dispatcher\\Standard.php on line 288

If I call $this->\_forward($fcontroller, $faction, $fparams); within a controller action object

This method has been modified recently. It's signature is now:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    final protected function _forward($action, $controller = null, $module = null, array $params = null)


Your error is probably triggered because you're using array as a module name.
