It does indeed, you can pass an expression as a column name ($select is an instance of Zend\\Db\\Sql\\Select)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->columns(array(
        'aid' => new Zend\Db\Sql\Expression('DISTINCT artist_id')
    ));


If you have to ensure that the column is properly quoted for future abstraction purposes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->columns(array(
        'aid' => new Zend\Db\Sql\Expression(
           'DISTINCT ?',
           'artist_id',
           array(Zend\Db\Sql\Expression::TYPE_IDENTIFIER))
    ));

This doesn't feel very obvious and causes an error if the distinct expression doesn't come first (certainly using MySQL). How can I take a base select query and later in another method add a join and make it return distinct rows? In my specific case I have a base query that selects orders, I might modify this with a join against the order items when I want to only select orders that have a certain item. In ZF1 you would simply do the join and call the distinct method.

You make an excellent point. I'll work on this soon.
