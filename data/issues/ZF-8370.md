ZF-8370: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_\*::beginTransaction() throws PDOException
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When an Exception is thrown from an underlying database connection method (like PDO), none of the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_\*'s seem to catch it (and throw a Zend\_Db\_Exception of their own). So, in my case, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql::beginTransaction() throws a PDOException when called on a connection that has a transaction already active.

It seems to me that those methods should catch the underlying exception and throw a Zend\_Db\_Exception, because I should not have to be aware of the underlying database connector of my Zend\_Db\_Adapter in the code using the adapter. At this time, I'll have to check for a PDOException in my client code, which becomes useless when switching Adapters to some non-PDO adapter.

Is there any logic behind this behavior or should I just patch it? (My CLA is already sent)
