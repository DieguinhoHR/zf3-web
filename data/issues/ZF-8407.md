### Description

The documentation ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.translate.using.html)) describes how you can use multiple numbered parameters in a string. But the examples are wrong!

Now there is: printf($translate->\_("Today is the \*%1\\$s\*") . "\\n", date('d.m.Y'));

The right example should be without the "\\" in "%1\\$s" : printf($translate->\_("Today is the \*%1$s\*") . "\\n", date('d.m.Y'));

Closing as non-issue.

Please read the PHP manual about printf/sprintf before stating that their syntax is wrong.

Your change would return 'Today is the ' and throw an warning about $s not being declared.
