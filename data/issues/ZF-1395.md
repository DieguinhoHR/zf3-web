There should be possibility to limit large result sets.

But it should be clearly described that it's not "top n" results. Just only result set size limitation feature.

That's a patch for ZF1.0 RC2 with result set limitation functionality.

I don't commit it right now because feature-freeze period. But it's tested and may be used.
