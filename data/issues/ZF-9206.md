### Description

When using setStream() method of Zend\_Http\_Client for redirecting the output to '<a>php://output</a>', a warning is thrown : {quote} _Warning:_ rewind() [function.rewind]: stream does not support seeking in __..._\\library\\Zend\\Http\\Client.php_ on line _998_ {quote}

Here is the sample code : {quote} $httpClient = new Zend\_Http\_Client(); $httpClient->setUri($myUri); $httpClient->setMethod(Zend\_Http\_Client::GET); $httpClient->setStream('<a>php://output</a>')->request(); {quote}

Here is a patch for fixing this issue.

We simply test if the stream is seekable before doing the call to rewind().

As I've attached a patch fixing the issue and nothing was done, is this issue will be fixed or not?
