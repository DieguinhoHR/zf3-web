### Description

All public methods on Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 operating on objects internally call \_fixupObjectName() to rawurlencode path parts.

Except, isObjectAvailable() does not do that. So, this code fails:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $objectName = 'mybucket/path with spaces/file.txt';
    $s3->putObject('path/to/file.txt', $objectName); // OK, file is uploaded
    $s3->isObjectAvailable($objectName); // throws Zend_Uri_Exception due to spaces in the object path


The solution is to add a call to \_fixupObjectName($object) in isObjectAvailable().

Applied to trunk and 1.11 release branch. Not sure if we'll do another RC to reflect this change, or simply incorporate it into the final release.
