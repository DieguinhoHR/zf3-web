ZF-4377: Custom ErrorHandler Class
----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-25T03:37:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-22T14:57:44.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

This is the same issue as was addressed here: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2314> and marked as "Not An Issue", but the proposed code by Matthew Weier O'Phinney:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $front->setParam('noErrorHandler');
    $front->regsterPlugin(new MyCustomErrorHandler, 100);


if you don't overload the postDispatch() method in ErrorHandler:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $frontController = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
            if ($frontController->getParam('noErrorHandler')) {
                return;
            }


And it seems pointless to overload the method in custom ErrorHandler just to remove that piece of code. As in my case I just need to add a preDispatch() method.

What i can make up from your description is that you are inheriting from Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_ErrorHandler. I would suggest to inherit from Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_Abstract instead.

Inheriting Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_ErrorHandler means inheriting it's behaviour, and therefore this is not an issue.
