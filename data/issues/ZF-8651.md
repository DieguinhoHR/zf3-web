ZF-8651: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::find() causes exception with empty multi-dimensional array parameter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-28T16:14:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-20T20:20:23.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): 
 Reporter:  Ken Stanley (dohpaz)  Assignee:  Ralph Schindler (ralph)  Tags: - Zend\_Db\_Table

 Attachments: - [Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/12547/Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.patch)
 
### Description

When passing in an empty multi-dimensional array into Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::find(), the following exception is thrown:

Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli\_Exception: Mysqli prepare error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ')))' at line 1 in /path/to/Zend/Db/Statement/Mysqli.php on line 77

The attached patch adds additional checks to the logic that builds the where clause that will keep the above exception from occurring.

I think it's an expected result, table::find() method repeats the same behavior as select::where()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // it will generate an invalid query
    $select->where('column_name = ?', null);


Notice that empty() returns true when given 0, '0', false and null. Sometimes a primary key column may contain zero/false as value, so this filter that you are suggesting may can't work, so you should check for null values only.

As i said, i'm not sure that's a bug, but in my application I always rewrite table::find() to bypass this exception. Anyway, once it's confirmed as a bug, your idea about ignoring empty values for PKs looks good.

This version of the patch will ignore key values that are null or empty arrays.

An exception is the proper response to invalid input to find() whether it occurs in Adapter or Statement. If an array of parameters is passed in, the expectation is that they produce a valid query.

If you can provide a use-case where passing in invalid/multi-dimensional null array's is a valid use case, please re-open, but this use case does not seem to make sense to me.

Thanks, Ralph
