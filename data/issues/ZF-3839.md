ZF-3839: Zend\_Form rendering 1.5.3
-----------------------------------

### Description

I admit I skipped 1.5.2. I've been using 1.5.1 and decided to update to 1.5.3. All my forms are different because Zend\_Form is now inserting in the formerly empty

 elements. I use standard decorators. For example: ZF 1.5.1 Locate System   ZF 1.5.3

  Locate System    This causes all my forms to display differently under FF and IE.

Any workarounds or plans to change this?

There was some munging in the report, and it's unclear what string is being added; I'm assuming that it's a no-break space. If so, then we will not be making changes. The no-break space was added to ensure that forms generated by Zend\_Form would validate; without the no-break space, they do not validate.
