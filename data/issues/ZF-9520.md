### Description

When I call $this->\_helper->autoCompleteDojo($matches) as stated in the documentation my PHPUnit tests crash without any response.

 
    <pre class="highlight">ThomasMBP:tests thobach$ /usr/local/zend/bin/phpunit
    PHPUnit 3.4.11 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    
    F...ThomasMBP:tests thobach$

The reason is that exit; is called in Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_AutoComplete\_Abstract when $suppressExit == false.

The class Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase already disables the exit statement (setExit(false), suppressExit) for: \* $redirector = Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('redirector'); \* $json = Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('json');

But it is not done for all the other possible exits in Zend Framework: \* Zend/OpenId.php \* Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/AutoComplete/Abstract.php \* Zend/ProgressBar/Adapter/JsPull.php \* ZendX/Console/Process/Unix.php

When I try to overload the dispatch function in my abstract class ControllerTestCase (extends Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase) and add the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dojo = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('autoCompleteDojo');
    $dojo->suppressExit = true;


nothing happens. Maybe autoCompleteDojo cannot be called via getStaticHelper.

So what I did was not using autoCompleteDojo as documented, but rather:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dojoHelper = $this->_helper->autoCompleteDojo;
    $dojoHelper->suppressExit = true;
    $dojoHelper->direct($matches);


If you have further questions, I am glad to help.
