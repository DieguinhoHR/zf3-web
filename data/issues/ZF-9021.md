### Description

In the documentation showing how to migrate to version 1.10, there are some errant HTML tags: the first "b" and "tt" tags in the document are not closed, screwing up the formatting for the remainder of the page:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/migration.110.html)

They occur in the Zend\_Controller\_Front section, immediately before the first sample code block.

I think the sentence would be better as following {quote} You can then test for that specific error with the constant Zend\_Controller\_Plugin\_ErrorHandler::EXCEPTION\_NO\_ROUTE: {quote}

in stead of {quote} You can then test for that specific error with the constant : {quote}
