ZF-2848: Zend\_Db\_Select::where()'s $type parameter handled improperly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-10T15:13:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-12T11:45:36.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Consider this really simple use case (assuming $db is a valid ZD\_Adapter object) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Livres extends Zend_Db_Table { }
    
    $s = new Zend_Db_Table_Select(new Livres($db));
    
    $s->where('isbn = ?','978-2212116762','varchar');
    
    echo $s;


expected : SELECT `Livres`.\* FROM `Livres` WHERE (isbn = '978-2212116762')

actual : SELECT `Livres`.\* FROM `Livres` WHERE (isbn = '978-2212116762', 'varchar')

where() doesn't treat the $type parameter in the right way, whatever it is, it just appends it as some kind of SQL column, which naturally result in an SQL error.

Note that this use case comes from a findParentRowset() method that works well but not the Select object it uses.

Additional note :

It seems that this bug can be caught in unit tests, especially Zend\_Db\_Table\_Relationships\_\* ones. It produces the following error while testing with Pdo\_Mysql adapter :

Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception: SQLSTATE[21000]: Cardinality violation: 1241 Operand should contain 1 column(s)

Sorry, but this is not a Zend\_Db\_Select problem...

First you are referring to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select in your example code. Second the type varchar does not exist for Zend\_Db\_Select nor for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select...

I expect the second is why you are not getting the expected results because Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select extends Zend\_Db\_Select.

Attaching output from testing Zend\_Db\_AllTests from latest trunk with pdo\_mysql enabled on WinXP, PHP 5.1.4

Ok, so the problem comes from the different find\*\*\*\*\*() methods in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract. They actually pass the string 'varchar' for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select->where() param $type ( when a 'Varchar' column is in use )

This result in an error while trying to find a parent or a dependant rowset.

The exact use case is a "findParentLivres()" call, it generates the following exception :

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Exception' with message 'SQLSTATE[21000]: Cardinality violation: 1241 Operand should contain 1 column(s)' in D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Statement\\Pdo.php:238 Stack trace: #0 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Statement.php(283): Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo->\_execute(Array) #1 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Abstract.php(406): Zend\_Db\_Statement->execute(Array) #2 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Pdo\\Abstract.php(206): Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract->query(Object(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select), Array) #3 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Table\\Abstract.php(1185): Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract->query(Object(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select)) #4 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Table\\Abstract.php(1082): Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract->\_fetch(Object(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select)) #5 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Table\\Row\\Abstract.php(892): Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract->fetchRow(Object(Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select)) #6 D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Table\\Row\\Abstract.php(1032): Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract->findParentRow('L in D:\\www\\ZF\\trunk\\library\\Zend\\Db\\Statement\\Pdo.php on line 238

If you run the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Relationships tests you will notice exactly the same exception, in the same use case. Darby can tell, I discussed with him about that.

please note as well that this bug cannot be reproducted on the 1.5 RC1 tag version. I can reproduct it with the HEAD revision.

I get similar results on Linux with PHP 5.2.5.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-03-10T16:54:38.000+0000

Changing component from Zend\_Db\_Select to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select... Also from the debug output it seems that the problem is related to Zend\_Db\_Table.

Please wait for Simon or Bill for this issue... I can only help on Zend\_Db\_Select related issues.

Assigning to [~peptolab] for possible review.

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-03-10T17:29:35.000+0000

I do not reproduce this problem for the release-1.5 branch using either Linux + PHP 5.2.5 or WinXP + 5.1.4. That is, the problem seems to be isolated to the trunk. More investigation to come...

Reassigning to [~thomas], as this appears to be a Zend\_Db\_Select problem.

It seems that the $type parameter being relegated to the Zend\_Db\_Select::where() method is not being properly treated. What is the _expected_ usage of this parameter, if not what already exists in the form of unit tests and this use case? Please advise. :)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-03-11T03:31:00.000+0000

Class will be reworked by Simon... sorry if I confused you julien. He has a better overview over the complete Db design, not only Zend\_Db\_Select and will help you better than me.

No prob ^^

Assigning back to [~peptolab] for possible review.

I was just looking through the related classes to see how this might be fixed, and I noticed something that might be useful in the process. All these observations are based on the trunk at r8757, except where noted.

Thomas mentioned to me on fw-db that Zend\_Db\_Select::where()'s $type argument is supposed to be an integer constant (Zend\_Db::INT\_TYPE, etc.). However, if you follow that argument down through the stack to where it finally gets used, you end up at Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::quote(), line 760 (756 in the incubator version). The API docs for that method say that $type should be "the SQL datatype name, or constant, or null;" a quick look at line 760 confirms that this is true, thanks to the $\_numericDataTypes array.

So, a string value for $type is acceptable further down the pipeline; clearly, however, it's not acceptable as early as Zend\_Db\_Select. This is due to the condition at line 362 of Zend\_Db\_Select, which absolutely mandates that $type be one of the three Zend\_Db TYPE constants.

There seem to be two possible solutions to this problem:

Refactor Zend\_Db\_Select::where() and any similarly affected methods so that their $type parameter can be anything in the associated adapter's $\_numericDataTypes array. This would be much, much easier if $\_numericDataTypes were a public property (or if it had a public accessor). The alternative is...
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Refactor Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract's relational row finders such that they only pass in Zend\_Db TYPE constants for the $type parameter of where() and any similarly affected methods.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================

Either of these would, I believe, solve the problem. Both would be easier if $\_numericDataTypes were publicly accessible.

In either case, I'm eager to see this problem solved...the members-only section of my new web app just flat crashes without a reliable findDependentRowset() method. :(

The where and orWhere methods now respect the original intent of the $type argument - Zend\_Db\_Select does not perform any checks on the $type value, it simply passes it to the adapter in order to process quoting. This resolves the issue of lookups, as in some adapters (like Postgre) the data type is a mandatory when performing lookups.

Resolved in trunk r8783

Confirmed : all my sites work back.

Nice Simon ;-)

Many thanks, Simon!
