### Description

Because a single authentication attempt may possibly result in multiple reasons why the attempt failed, the authentication attempt should make available these messages. In the context of the current Zend\_Auth\_Token\_Interface, the getMessage() method could be changed to getMessages(), where the method returns an array of string messages that explain why the authentication failed. For example, an authentication attempt may result in an array of messages such as "user may only log in between 8:00am and 5:00pm" and "user may not log in from 10.0.0.1". This change would support receiving failure messages from validator chains, as from Zend\_Validate, currently in the incubator.
