ZF-11209: Allow Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry to accept multiple enclosures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2011-03-22T23:25:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-05-14T00:08:49.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

Atom (and Zend\_Feed\_Atom) supports having arbitrarily many enclosures for an entry, but Zend\_Feed\_Writer does not.

Zend\_Feed\_Writer\_Entry only has a setEnclosure method which can only accept one enclosure, and stores only a single enclosure, not an array.

If the Entry class accepted and stored multiple enclosures, the Atom renderer could render all of them, while the RSS renderer would render only the first.
