ZF-5065: getQueryTerms() has problem with national characters

### Description

I wanted to get all the terms from parsed user's query - so I used the getQueryTerms().

But as it works well with english words it has problems with other languages with national characters.

Eg. we have the word 'żółw' (turtle). The function returns two terms: 'z' and 'olw'. Or 'naleśnik' (pancake) - we get 'nale' and 'snik'.

The words are being split on those characters. I've tried setting and forcing utf-8 wherever possible (functions, static variables and locale) on Linux and Windows, ZF 1.7.0.

Is this a bug or a feature?

usually queries are parsed with the default analyzer when being rewritten with $query->rewrite()

I can't tell from the description what flow those queries went through, but if the analyzer / tokenizer used splits those strings, so would the query parser.

Maybe its an analyzer problem. Did you use the Common\_Utf8 one?
