### Description

I tested Zend\_Http\_Client incubator version working with Zend\_Service\_Amazon.

Zend\_Service\_Amazon has $\_httpClient property it owns a Zend\_Http\_Client object. And the object is created by following code in Zend\_Service\_Abstract at line 69.

 
            self::$_httpClient = new Zend_Http_Client();


But Zend\_Http\_Client incubator version's cunstructor wants a required $uri parameter, and it's the cause of fatal error.

If Zend\_Http\_Client incubator version replaces to the current version, it will be fixed.

Please test again with revision 707 - update me with the results so I can close the bug.

Also, please update me regarding ZF-97 so I can close that one as well.
