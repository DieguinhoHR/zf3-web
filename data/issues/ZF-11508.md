### Description

I have created a small navigation and for some elements I have created routes. Routes defintion is as following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
        'photographGallery' => array(
            'type'   => 'Zend_Controller_Router_Route',
            'route'  => 'photograph/:action/:id',
            'defaults' => array(
                'module' => 'default',
                'controller' => 'gallery',
                'action' => 'index',
                'id' => 0,
                'typeId' => 1,
            ),
        ),
        'paintingGallery' => array(
            'type'   => 'Zend_Controller_Router_Route',
            'route'  => 'painting/:action/:id',
            'defaults' => array(
                'module' => 'default',
                'controller' => 'gallery',
                'action' => 'index',
                'id' => 0,
                'typeId' => 2,
            ),
        ),
    );


This is the navigation structure:

 
    <pre class="highlight">array(
        array(
            'label' => 'Homepage',
            'module' => 'default',
            'controller' => 'index',
            'action' => 'index',
            'route' => 'default',
        ),
        array(
            'label' => 'Photograph',
            'module' => 'default',
            'controller' => 'gallery',
            'action' => 'index',
            'route' => 'photographGallery',
        ),
        array(
            'label' => 'Painting',
            'module' => 'default',
            'controller' => 'gallery',
            'action' => 'index',
            'route' => 'paintingGallery',
        ),
    );


When I know open the website on my dev machine and navigate to "Photograph" or "Painting", both navigation pages have the "active" class on the "li" element. I guess Zend\_Navigation doesn't take the route name into account for finding the active navigation page. Routing is ok so far.

This behaviour blocks me to publish the website at the moment.

Please check if this issue occurs on trunk as well. I think I patched this issue already a few weeks ago (if it is, it will be released in 1.11.8).

Thanks.

I'll wait for the release of 1.11.8 and update this issue if it's working or not. Thank you for your fast response :)
