ZF-5352: To,Cc,Bcc email fields injection

### Description

Executing this code:

$mail = new Zend\_Mail(); // ... $mail->addCc('email@example.com', 'Injected email" [injected.email@example.com](mailto:injected.email@example.com), "Normal email'); $mail->send();

results in really sending an email with the following header:

Cc: "Injected email" [injected.email@example.com](mailto:injected.email@example.com), "Normal email" [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)

An even simpler way to add more recipients than expected:

$mail->addCc('email@example.com,another.email@example.com');

Same problem with $mail->addTo() or $mail->addBcc() .

I think that these methods should _only add one single recipient, not more_... (It would be a good protection from spam)

An easy way to correct the first problem should be by escaping (addcslashes()) the double-quote character (") with a backslash (\\") when the recipient name needs to be quoted... This way the Cc header of the first example would be: Cc: "Injected email\\" [injected.email@example.com](mailto:injected.email@example.com), \\"Normal email" [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)

For the second problem just checking for NO commas in the $email parameter should be ok.

Both these patches can be implemented within the method Zend\_Mail::\_addRecipientAndHeader().

Solved in SVN r13498

make to change comma and double quote mark in mail address into question mark.

I hear from Andrea Zilio that this issue rests some problem by email as following .

**_from here_** What I wanted to say is that your svn commit (r13498) seems to solve only the second problem I've reported... In fact running this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    // ...
    $mail->addCc('email@example.com', 'Injected email" , "Normal email');
    $mail->send();


still sends an email with this header:

Cc: "Injected email" [injected.email@example.com](mailto:injected.email@example.com), "Normal email" [normal@example.com](mailto:normal@example.com)

So the mail will be sent to two different recipients.

Solved in SVN r I add \_filterName() function.

The function changes the double quotation to single quotation and the angle brackets to square brackets.
