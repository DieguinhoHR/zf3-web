Hi,

We are having a problem retrieving some data from the index. We are searching on dates in the format 20070829 using Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_TextNum\_CaseInsensitive as the analyzer. When we do a search zeros, 8 and 9 are stripped from the query making them not work at all. Changing the regex in Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Analysis\_Analyzer\_Common\_TextNum.php on line 74 from /[a-zA-Z1-7]+/ to /[a-zA-Z0-9]+/ resolves the issue.

I am wondering if is a bug or is something else happening that I am not aware of.

TIA,

Andrew
