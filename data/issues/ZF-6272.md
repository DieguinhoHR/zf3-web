ZF-6272: Missing functionality in Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList, or Zend\_Locale\_Data::getList

### Description

There is an example of code from manual:

__Example 31.20. All available translations__ {quote}// obtain a list of all the translation lists $lists = $locale->getTranslationList();

// show all translation lists available // (lots of output, all in English language) foreach ($lists as $list) { echo "List $list = "; print\_r($locale->getTranslationList($list)); }{quote}

This example code for me is not working, as on $lists = $locale->getTranslationList(); I get an exception "Unknown list () for parsing locale data."

According to example in manual and definition of Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList in code I assume that NULL value is normal for $path parameter: {quote}public static function getTranslationList($path = null, $locale = null, $value = null){quote} and in case it is NULL, it should return a list of translations. But this function doesn't do anything with $path, just simply use it for call of Zend\_Locale\_Data::getList function. After reviewing Zend\_Locale\_Data::getList implementation, I see that it doesn't consider NULL as valid value for $path parameter and if it is NULL simply throws an exception I had mentioned above.

I see inconsistency there and one of later should be done: A) Example removed from manual and definition of Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList fixed to public static function getTranslationList($path -= null-, $locale = null, $value = null) B) Implemented functionality described in manual.

I use ZF v1.7.8. Had checked repository, but those functions everywhere looks the same.
