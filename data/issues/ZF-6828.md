ZF-6828: \_\_sleep of Zend\_Db's Adapters
-----------------------------------------

### Description

\_\_sleep() method of class Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_\* mustn't finish connection to DB ($this->\_connection = false;).

Think about serialization of for example the Zend\_Paginator (for caching it in other way than Zend\_Paginator::setCache() do). If we'll serialize Zend\_Paginator (which used Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect), we serialize Zend\_Db\_Adapter too. So we disconnect connection from a database. Next call to any Zend\_Db\_\* (with lazy connection) creates new connection...

Hi, Adam.

Probably, you may also need \_\_wakeup() method for unserialization , I think.

Yeah, but this isn't a problem. The problem is that you have disconnected DB (if you serializing any of Zend\_Db's object) - and you connect again when you unserialize it.

I am having trouble understanding the use case. Please reopen with some short reproduction case that demonstrates the issue you are having.
