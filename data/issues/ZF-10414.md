### Description

In the Zend\_View Docs at (Version 1.10): [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.introduction.html)

it says: "encoding: indicate the character encoding to use with htmlentities(), htmlspecialchars(), and other operations. Defaults to ISO-8859-1 (latin1). May be set via setEncoding() or the encoding option to the constructor. "

In the advisory at: [http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/…](http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2010-01)

it says: "The afore-mentioned [Zend\_View] classes have been reworked to use a default character encoding of UTF-8...a decision was made to default to UTF-8 for the internal encoding mechanisms used by Zend\_View. "

These two documents seem to be conflicting.

- - - - - -

Although, looking into my Zend\_View object (version 1.9.8) it appears that it does default to UTF-8 - so the Documentation for Zend View is more likely to be the wrong one.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    abstract class Zend_View_Abstract implements Zend_View_Interface
    {
        ...
    
        /**
         * Encoding to use in escaping mechanisms; defaults to utf-8
         * @var string
         */
        private $_encoding = 'UTF-8';
    
        ...

Thanks for the report -- the issue was indeed in the documentation, and I've updated it in trunk and the 1.10 release branch.
