### Description

Actual it is not allowed to use such a phpdoc comment:

/\*\* \* @access public \* @param int $iTest \* @param int $iFoo \* @return bool \*/

(there are 2 whitespaces after @param and @return)

This is because there are following regexp: /@return ([^\\s]_)/ /@return [^\\s]_\\s+(._?)(@|\*\\/)/s /@param ([^ ]_) / /@param [^\\s]_\\s+(\\$[^ ]_)\\s+(.\*?)(@|\*\\/)/s

To solve this problem there must be a "+" after the whitespace: /@return +([^\\s]_)/ /@return +[^\\s]_\\s+(._?)(@|\*\\/)/s /@param +([^ ]_) / /@param +[^\\s]_\\s+(\\$[^ ]_)\\s+(.\*?)(@|\*\\/)/s

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
