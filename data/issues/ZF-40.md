ZF-40: Zend\_Db\_Select SQL: FOR UPDATE
---------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-19T23:10:52.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T16:25:48.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

When Zend\_Db\_Select::_toString() is called the FOR UPDATE syntax should be processed by the Zend\_Db\_Adapter_\* that it belongs to. The current method generates a syntax that is incompatible with MySQL. Allowing the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_\*::limit() method to process a $forUpdate flag would solve the problem.

There should also be support for SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE, and the corresponding locking modes in SQLite ( <http://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html> ), and similar for the other adapters. This issue overlaps with [ZF-39].

The SQL-only version of this has been resolved in r7508 in trunk.
