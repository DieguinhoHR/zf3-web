### Description

When trying to set the plugin loader with the options passed to the constructor a exception is thrown because it is'nt possible to define the type of the pluginloader in the options and the setter of the plugin loader is called with only one parameter.

one solution is to remove the support of the pluginloader in the "setOptions". another solution is to define a options parameter for each loadter type, like $option["decoratorPluginLoader"]
