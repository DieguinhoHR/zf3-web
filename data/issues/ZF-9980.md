### Description

Hello! There is a problem in the JQuery Resource Plugin:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
           if ((isset($key['uienable']) && (bool) $key['uienable'])
                || (isset($key['ui_enable']) && (bool) $key['ui_enable'])
                || (!isset($key['ui_enable']) && !isset($key['uienable'])))
           {
              ...
    


the variable $key is used in the foreach-loop before:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($options as $key => $value) {
    ...


$key should be replaced by $options:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
           if ((isset($options['uienable']) && (bool) $options['uienable'])
                || (isset($options['ui_enable']) && (bool) $options['ui_enable'])
                || (!isset($options['ui_enable']) && !isset($options['uienable'])))
            {
                $this->_view->JQuery()->uiEnable();
            } else {
                $this->_view->JQuery()->uiDisable();
            }


best regards, rené kerner

What configuration are you trying to do? What is the outcome? And what is the expected outcome?

i don't like to repeat myself... but if it is really necessary:

as described above and in the issue title, the JQuery resource plugin doesn't parse application.ini / config-options for uienable/ui\_enable correct because it's not read from the $options variable, but from the $key variable, which only exists in the foreach-loop-block.

application.ini: resources.jquery.uienable = 0

jquery ui should be disabled.

but it's not disabled by the zend application resource plugin.

Aber naturlich kan ich das ;)

Pushing usually doesn't work. ZF is mainly maintained by volunteers, and as such, they sometimes do have time, and sometimes they don't.

I know. But I published that issue more than 2 weeks ago and it was a very simple bug. And there was no reaction until AND I also submitted the patch for this bug, directly with the issue.

the point is; there are a lot of small bugs known in the issue tracker. In any way; the issue has been resolved in trunk, and was merged with the 1.10 release branch. Meaning that it will be released in the next mini release.
