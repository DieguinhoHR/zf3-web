ZF-4230: Strange exception inheritance
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-09-09T08:03:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-31T03:56:57.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Every exception in the Zend Framework is inherited from the class Zend\_Exception. But Zend\_InfoCard\_Exception checks if the class Zend\_Exception exists. If not it will be inherited from Exception. This is a unpredictable behaviour which nobody would expect.

So i think it should be compatible to all other exceptions and have a hard dependency to Zend\_Exception.

I think the programmer did this because Zend\_InfoCard is one of the components who have got a special build and are used without other components BUT Zend\_Exception is included in the infocard build.

This is expected behavior because Zend\_InfoCard is also shipped as a stand-alone component without the Zend\_Exception class and thus must extend from Exception instead of Zend\_Exception.

Fix for this "bug" ;)

This is NOT correct. Yes Zend\_Infocard is shipped seperately in a infocard build but Zend\_Exception is included in this build.

Like Tobias said, there will be no problem to ship Zend\_Exception with Zend\_Infocard.

This

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    try {
      /* Some Infocard-code */
    } catch (Zend_Exception $e) {
      /* Some Exception code */
    }

Will work ... maybe

It will not "maybe" work, it will definitely work because Zend\_Exception is shipped together with Zend\_Infocard, but i seems the developer has no intention to have a look of about 2 minutes on the infocard package.
