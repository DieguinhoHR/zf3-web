### Description

i updated from 1.7.4 to 1.7.5 and tested the ned dojo version... i saw some changes but the version number is the same like in 1.7.4... maybe because of the svn import?

This is actually due to the Dojo team not updating the version in their repo. The version is actually a 1.2.x version (we're pinned to the 1.2 development branch currently), but is not reporting as such.

I'll contact the Dojo team to let them know, but am closing this issue as it's not something the ZF team controls.

I spent a bit of time on this too, Would it be possible to add a README or README.Zend in ./externals/dojo to indicate what the version included is?

I think it would be a good practice for anything external that get pulls in.

Thanks, --Rob
