### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu has the ability to set the default menu's ul class. Though it does not have the ability to set an ul ID.

Since many existing js menu's rely on ID, you would have to create a partial view every time you use the navigation. Also, to write efficient css rules you would many times be better off with an ID on your navigation menu.

I would have expected that setting an ID would be part of the most basic features.
