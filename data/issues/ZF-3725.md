ZF-3725: Array adapter doesn't preserve keys
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-07-23T10:13:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-03T20:29:40.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently the Array adapter doesn't preserve the keys of the input. E.g:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
        'foo' => 'foo',
        'bar' => 'bar,
        'baz' => 'baz'
    }
    
    // or
    
    array(
        11 => 'foo',
        12 => 'bar',
        13 => 'baz'
    )
    
    // would become
    
    array(
        0 => 'foo',
        1 => 'bar',
        2 => 'baz'
    )


I'm curious to see if there's a use case where you might want to preserve the keys before I start adding support for preserving the keys to Paginator.

There's been no feedback on this in over a month, so I'm closing this. If someone who needs this and has a good use case at some point in the future, it can be reopened.
