### Description

h4. Summary In getDOM() for Zend\_Gdata\_Calendar\_EventEntry, $this->\_quickadd is misspelt as $this->quickadd.

h4. Details: This function is called when exporting a calendar EventEntry to XML. Convention is to access each relevant property directly. By omitting the underscore before the name, the magic getter is called instead.

Because getters are currently equivalent to direct access, this does not impair the functionality of the library. However, it should be fixed for consistency.

h4. Steps to Reproduce: None. Does not introduce bugs under implementation.

h4. Regression: Bug introduced in r5148. Currently affects trunk and ZF 1.0 RC2.

h4. Workarounds: None needed.

h4. Notes: Not caught by unit tests because this does not adversely affect current behavior. However, if getters were changed in future versions to behave differently from direct access this bug could have caused discrepancies in XML output which would have been caught by existing unit tests.
