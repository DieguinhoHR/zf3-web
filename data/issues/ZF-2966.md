Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

I would love to participate in this task if that is possible. I have been looking a bit into this, here at my company we are about to create web services and have come to conclusion to use SOAP. I have already started creating a controller named Foo\_Controller\_Action\_Soap\_Server which would be extended by the actual controller (eg. within a module). The idea is to create a controller that has a SoapServer (or Zend\_Soap\_Server) to handle requests, and then have actions that would be something like these;

indexAction - <http://example.com/module/controller/> - If a POST request the server will handle it, otherwise forward to funcsAction.
======================================================================================================================================

wsdlAction - <http://example.com/module/controller/wsdl> - Construct and display the WSDL file
==============================================================================================

funcsAction - <http://example.com/module/controller/funcs> - List available function list with arguments and types
==================================================================================================================

viewAction - [http://example.com/module/controller/…](http://example.com/module/controller/view/function/someFunction) - View a selected function with more detailed information from the docblock
==================================================================================================================================================================================================

This was at least the idea, and with Zend\_Soap\_Server and the WSDL Generation this will be allot easier.

Hi Helgi!

You are really welcome! :) Do not hesitate to take SOAP tasks you prefer.

PS Take a look into incubator to check tasks are already done.

[ZF-3273] SOAP access to controllers subtask is converted to separate issue. So this issue becomes resolved.
