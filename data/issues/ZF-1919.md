### Description

I ran into this when trying to interoperate with a python XMLRPC server.

There is an extension to the xml spec which allows a element in place of other values: <http://ontosys.com/xml-rpc/extensions.php>

I have already implemented this building off of handling for booleans, but I would like feedback as to whether I should submit the changes back into the main codebase.

Are there any cases where someone is sending or recieving PHP NULL values and is counting on them to be translated differently, e.g. as FALSE?

What is the status of this issue? Is it approved for inclusion in 1.5?

Because in next week I will need Nil in XML-RPC of Zend Framework, I've implemented this part by my self on this weekend. In patch you will find Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_Nil, changes for Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value and Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server. Moreover, some tests for Nil added.

Because I didn't found the way, how to write correct tests for this (passing NIL from client to server and getting it back), I'm sharing my simple client and server that I've used for developing and tests.

NIL support added to trunk and release 1.5 branch.

Is there a way to disable this funtionality, and use the old behaviour (empty string)? Since it is an extension to XML-RPC, it isn't implemented by all XML-RPC clients (CodeIgniter for example).
