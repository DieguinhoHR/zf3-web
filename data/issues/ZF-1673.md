This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

This is a big undertaking, and I am not sure we should look at this until we have a chance to examine Zend\_Session 2.0, as noted on the Zend\_Session 2.0 page. Better testing requires we build a better tester.

Updating project management info.
