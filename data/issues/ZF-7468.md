### Description

 
    in Zend_locale class in lines 327 and 329 codes are:
    
        line 327 : $language = substr($language, 0, (strpos($language, '.')-1));
        line 329 : $language = substr($language, 0, (strpos($language, '@') - 1));
    
        if you echo $language befor and after line 327, you can see it work wrong, for eample:
        befor line 327 $language value is "Farsi_Iran.1256" and after that "Farsi_Ira"
    
        it seems no need to minus one from strpos($language, '.') and codes should be as below:
    
        line 327 : $language = substr($language, 0, (strpos($language, '.')));
        line 329 : $language = substr($language, 0, (strpos($language, '@')));

Changed to be a feature as there seem to be a difference between the official locale list and the known locale strings from Windows.

Official Locale List: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260>(VS.85).aspx

The official locale list does not mention Farsi

Duplicates the reason from ZF-7469

with thanks:

1- it is just an example for eplain the problem. so problem exists for all official locales like this: English\_United States would not be recognised as en\_US and just recognoised as "en".

2- in official locale [](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260(VS.85).aspx)<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260>(VS.85).aspx there is Persian(iran) locale with "fa\_IR" locale name and 0429 locale identifier

But you did not request "Persian\_Iran", you requested "Farsi\_Iran" which is not mentioned within the official list.
