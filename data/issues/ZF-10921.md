ZF-10921: fail to do move\_uploaded\_file() in windows platform
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In Windows platform, If file is not named in English( maybe Chinese or Japanese), it will lead move\_uploaded\_file( ) failed.

Please see Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http line 180.

And I feel strange and unnecessary to move file after uploading, especially user doesn't use setDestination( ) to indicated new folder.

This issue seems to depend on (or relate to) ZF-8541 for me.
