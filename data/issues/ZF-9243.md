### Description

In 1.10.1, we removed the suppression operator from DOMDocument::loadFile/loadHTMLFile calls. However, this means that if DOMDocument reports errors -- even just notices or warnings -- PHPUnit's error handler catches these and reports errors. This can result in false negatives in ControllerTestCase test cases.

Fixed in trunk and 1.10 release branch.
