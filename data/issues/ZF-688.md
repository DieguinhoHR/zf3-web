### Description

The wikification script should not add paragraphs directly under the next one.

Paragraphs are normaly seperated with a small distance. Not a complete new line but a half one.

Otherwise the paragraph seperated text is presented as one textblock which is not correct.

Best would be to add a seperation of a half line between two paragraphs.
