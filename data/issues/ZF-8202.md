### Description

Zend\_View\_Abstract is the only class that restricts usage to the defined Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader. Other components like Zend\_Form, Zend\_Filter\_Inflector, Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker allow usage of another defined pluginloader via the Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Interface

Zend\_View\_Abstract::setPluginLoader() needs Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader instead of Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Interface because Zend\_View\_Abstract::getHelperPaths() is using a getPaths()-method that is not declared in the interface, so we cannot change this.

A way to solve this is to add getPaths() to Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader\_Interface, but this will break backwards compatibility.

Postponing to 2.0.

Zend\_View\_Abstract already correctly requires Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader (and not the interface), so getPaths() must be defined in any plugin loader attached to the view helper.

That said, this should change in the future, but, also as noted, it cannot be done cleanly right now without a BC change.
