ZF-10610: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Sqs is not using the region to create queues

### Description

Create queue is not using the region to correctly create the queue on the specified Amazon Endpoint. Amazon has four endpoints that can be used based on your location [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueSeâ€¦](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/2009-02-01/SQSDeveloperGuide/) Create is not using the region parameter to create queues on the correct endpoint.

In Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Sqs the \_makeRequest method should take into account the region that was specified in the constructor.

$client->setUri('<a href="">http://'.$this</a>->\_sqsEndpoint);

I worked around this by extending the class with this method and putting it to use in the constructor.

protected function \_setEndpoint($endpoint) { $this->\_sqsEndpoint = $endpoint; }

public function \_\_construct($accessKey = null, $secretKey = null, $region = null) { parent::\_\_construct($accessKey, $secretKey, $region); $endpoint = "sqs.$region.amazonaws.com"; $this->\_setEndpoint($endpoint); }

Sorry for that terrible formatting. Let me try that again.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _setEndpoint($endpoint) 
    {
        $this->_sqsEndpoint = $endpoint;
    }
        
    public function __construct($accessKey = null, $secretKey = null, $region = null)
    {
        parent::__construct($accessKey, $secretKey, $region);
        $endpoint = "sqs.$region.amazonaws.com";
        $this->_setEndpoint($endpoint);
    }

Added the code to override the default region.

Added a list of possible endpoints (as of 2011-09-25) and a method to add new regions if they appear..
