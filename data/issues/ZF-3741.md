### Description

Newly added FirePHP works great and it handles more than strings, so a nicely formatted array or exception can be printed in firebug console. Unfortunately standard zend log writer/formatter don't support anything else than a string and if multiple writers are used it's causing notices eg.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $logger = new Zend_Log();
    
    $fireWriter = new Zend_Wildfire_FirebugLogWriter();
    $logger->addWriter($fireWriter);
            
    $streamWriter = new Zend_Log_Writer_Stream("/dev/null");
    $logger->addWriter($streamWriter);
            
    $logger->info(range(1,10));


triggers Notice: Array to string conversion in /home/sites/shared/library/Zend/Log/Formatter/Simple.php on line 72

It would be nice if the formatter ignored variables that are not strings and objects that does not implement \_\_toString() method avoiding this notice. Alternatively arrays or objects could be passed through print\_r() or similar so they can be displayed.

Possible solution for "simple" writer. Rather than running variable through print\_r it simply converts it to a string calling \_\_toString() on the object if it exists.

If this is an acceptable solution I can commit along with unit tests.

\_\_toString() is already called automatically, the problem are objects that don't implement it and arrays, they need to be ignored or converted to strings manually

Right. My patch effectively ignores them (by printing the variable type) if the \_\_toString() method is not implemented.

We could convert them to a string but in which format? print\_r() is not really suited for single line logging nor is serialize().

My patch may not be the final solution, but it eliminates the notice for now and does not change the logic otherwise.

Provided patch won't help if objects don't implement \_\_toString()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Catchable fatal error: Object of class Foo could not be converted to string in...


Alternative solution could be to silence that function

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $output = @str_replace("%$name%", $value, $output);

You are right. Don't know how I missed that.

Silencing would work for me too.

Or how about this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((is_object($value) && !method_exists($value,'__toString'))
        || is_array($value)) {
    
        $value = gettype($value);  
    }
              
    $output = str_replace("%$name%", $value, $output);

Looks good to me.

Chrisoph -- can you apply this to trunk and 1.6 branch prior to 6 Aug 2008, 6pm PDT? If not, I'll apply. Is there a test for it?

 

 

Posted by Christoph Dorn (cadorn) on 2008-08-05T21:17:52.000+0000

I'll apply it tomorrow along with a test.

 

 

Posted by Christoph Dorn (cadorn) on 2008-08-06T09:43:23.000+0000

Applied changes and added test to trunk, merged to 1.6 release branch.
