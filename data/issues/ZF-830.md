### Description

I am not sure this is worth the effort, but it seems worthy enough to consider.

Shahar and I were chatting about preventing access to unit tests by web servers, in order to minimize unforseen security risks.

For example, we could test for something like $\_SERVER['REMOTE\_ADDR'] or add a ".htaccess" file to help prevent accidentally executing files in the "tests" directory.

I should note the obvious - not all webservers recognize .htaccess, and even Apache can be configured to ignore them. However, stopping 95% of most use cases still has some value in reducing risks of accidental deployment of the unit tests onto a live website.
