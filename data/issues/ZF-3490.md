ZF-3490: Throw an exception for exceeding lifetimes
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-06-21T14:18:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:38:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

For the memcached backend, there is a lifetime limit of 30 days (2592000 seconds). Memcached will not store cache entries that have a lifetime longer than that, but the backend doesn't throw any error. So, the memcached backend should throw an exception if the lifetime exceeds 2592000 seconds, so debugging on this issue is much easier.

an exception could be see as an API break

so a warning in log is probably a good compromise, isn't it ?

It is a lot better than giving a lifetime of a year that is not working while you don't know why, and yes, the log is a good compromise.
