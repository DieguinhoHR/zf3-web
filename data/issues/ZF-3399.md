### Description

Subclasses of Zend\_Db\_Select cannot be used by Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::select() because it instantiates Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select (which in turn extends Zend\_Db\_Select).

The only way around this is to first copy/paste the contents of Zend/Db/Table/Select.php and change the class it extends to your custom class. Then, you need to subclass Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract and overload Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::select() to instantiate My\_Db\_Table\_Select instead of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select.

Rather than copy/paste, we are using a subclass of Zend\_Db\_Table, which applies the same approach as is used for the row and rowset subclasses:

New:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Classname for Table Select statement
         *
         * @var string
         */
        protected $_selectClass = 'Zend_Db_Table_Select';


Updated:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Returns an instance of a Zend_Db_Table_Select object.
         *
         * @return Zend_Db_Table_Select
         */
        public function select()
        {
            @Zend_Loader::loadClass($this->_selectClass);
            return new $this->_selectClass($this);
        }


I think this code could be copied straight into Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract.

This allows users to override the Table\_Select class in the same way they override the row or rowset classes, and would make the class more consistent.

\_where() might also need to be updated. Currently the class is fixed:

 
    <pre class="highlight">    /**
         * Generate WHERE clause from user-supplied string or array
         *
         * @param  string|array $where  OPTIONAL An SQL WHERE clause.
         * @return Zend_Db_Table_Select
         */
        protected function _where(Zend_Db_Table_Select $select, $where)

If we are allowed to specify our own class, it might not be a sub-class of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select.

I know that the normal practice would be to subclass Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select and then make any changes necessary, but Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select is a sub-class of Zend\_Db\_Select and this is also frequently sub-classed (e.g. to support bind variables). I have found it easier to incorporate the functionality I need by sub-classing Zend\_Db\_Select first (e.g. My\_Db\_Select extends Zend\_Db\_Select), and then sub-classing that to inherit the additional functionality at the table level (My\_Db\_Table\_Select extends My\_Db\_Select).

This means that I have to keep My\_Db\_Table\_Select as a verbatim copy of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, except for the extends clause! It would be better if these classes used composition rather than inheritance, but that is another battle! I'm hoping that Zend\_Db\_Select will be enhanced to bind variables and I can forget about my sub classes.

In any case, for people in my situation who are deliberately using a Table Select that is not sub-classed from Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, the following might be better:

 
    <pre class="highlight">    /**
         * Generate WHERE clause from user-supplied string or array
         *
         * @param  string|array $where  OPTIONAL An SQL WHERE clause.
         * @return Zend_Db_Table_Select
         */
        protected function _where($select, $where)
        {
            if (! $select instanceof $this->_selectClass) {
                $type = gettype($select);
                if ($type == 'object') {
                    $type = 'an object of class ' . get_class($select);
                }
                require_once 'Zend/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Exception('Select must be a ' . $this->_selectClass . ', but it is ' . $type);
            }
            
            $where = (array) $where;
    
            foreach ($where as $key => $val) {
                // is $key an int?
                if (is_int($key)) {
                    // $val is the full condition
                    $select->where($val);
                } else {
                    // $key is the condition with placeholder,
                    // and $val is quoted into the condition
                    $select->where($key, $val);
                }
            }
    
            return $select;
        }

There are other places where a function requires a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, e.g. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract->findDependentRowset, so removing the class requirement and replacing it with the check I suggest above is probably not a good idea as it will be required in many places.

A better approach might be to create Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select\_Interface and require that instread. Then our custom classes could just implement the interface.

Zend\_Db\_Adapter is similarly affected. It has variables for $\_defaultStmtClass and $\_defaultProfilerClass but not one for $\_defaultSelectClass. It would be better if the select class could also be changed easily.

I think this requires the addition of:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
         * Default class name for a Select statement.
         *
         * @var string
         */
        protected $_defaultSelectClass = 'Zend_Db_Select';

and:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
         * Get the default select class.
         *
         * @return string
         */
        public function getSelectClass()
        {
            return $this->_defaultSelectClass;
        }
    
        /**
         * Set the default select class.
         *
         * @return Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract Fluent interface
         */
        public function setSelectClass($class)
        {
            $this->_defaultSelectClass = $class;
            return $this;
        }

And updating:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
         * Creates and returns a new Zend_Db_Select object for this adapter.
         *
         * @return Zend_Db_Select
         */
        public function select()
        {
            return new Zend_Db_Select($this);
        }

To:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
        /**
         * Creates and returns a new Zend_Db_Select object for this adapter.
         *
         * @return Zend_Db_Select
         */
        public function select()
        {
            Zend_Loader::loadClass($this->_defaultSelectClass);
            return new $this->_defaultSelectClass($this);
        }

For consistency and completeness we also need getter and setter methods for the $\_select in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract:

 
    <pre class="literal">
        /**
         * @param  string $classname
         * @return Zend_Db_Table_Abstract Provides a fluent interface
         */
        public function setSelectClass($classname)
        {
            $this->_selectClass = (string) $classname;
    
            return $this;
        }
    
        /**
         * @return string
         */
        public function getSelectClass()
        {
            return $this->_selectClass;
        }

I agree that for such uses cases (that I understand), some interfaces are highly needed.

Zend\_Db\_Select\_Interface should then define all the Zend\_Db\_Select methods that are actually used by Zend classes which use Zend\_Db\_Select typed params (all ?) The Interface should also define a public function \_\_construct(Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract $adapter) signature

We should also create a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select\_Interface extending Zend\_Db\_Select\_Interface and adding Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select methods to it for Zend object using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select objects as input method params

When extending Zend\_Db\_Select::assemble() (to make it able to return only one part of generated SQL SELECT query) I ran into the same problem than Roger Hunwicks's {quote} I know that the normal practice would be to subclass Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select and then make any changes necessary, but Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select is a sub-class of Zend\_Db\_Select and this is also frequently sub-classed (e.g. to support bind variables). I have found it easier to incorporate the functionality I need by sub-classing Zend\_Db\_Select first (e.g. My\_Db\_Select extends Zend\_Db\_Select), and then sub-classing that to inherit the additional functionality at the table level (My\_Db\_Table\_Select extends My\_Db\_Select).

This means that I have to keep My\_Db\_Table\_Select as a verbatim copy of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, except for the extends clause! It would be better if these classes used composition rather than inheritance, but that is another battle! I'm hoping that Zend\_Db\_Select will be enhanced to bind variables and I can forget about my sub classes. {quote} And copy/pasting Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select proper code (the one that differs from Zend\_Db\_Select) into My\_Db\_Table\_Select is quite "ugly" but seems to be the only way.

I think using interfaces in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract instead of concrete classes would be a good step forward.

I agree, but this type of change would have to wait till 2.0 time as it would be a mostly-complete rewrite that is needed to facilitate this.
