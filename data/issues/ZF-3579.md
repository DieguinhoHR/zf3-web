### Description

Trying to set the id in a FormRadio Element does not work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->formRadio( array( 'name' => 'foo', 'id' => 'foo' ), null, null, array( 'foo' => 'bar' ) ); 
    
    or
    
    $view->formRadio( 'foo', null, array( 'id' => 'foo' ), array( 'foo' => 'bar' ) );
    


Expected Output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    
    bar
    


Bit instead produces the above without the id in it.

Suggested fix in FormRadio.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
                $radio = '_htmlAttribs($label_attribs) . '>'
                        . (('prepend' == $labelPlacement) ? $opt_label : '')
                        . '_htmlAttribs($attribs) 
                        . $endTag
                        . (('append' == $labelPlacement) ? $opt_label : '')
                        . '';


Since the id is explicitly removed from the attributes and pushed into $info['id'] so it is definitely there but never used after that.

The FormRadio helper can create multiple radio buttons at the same time if the $options array contains more than one element, therefore it wouldn't be correct to assign the same id to all of them.

True, but when explicitly setting the id in code using $attrib, I'd expect it to get assigned. Nothing happening at all is completely unexpected behaviour. This makes accessing the elements via JS unnecessarily complicated.

This is already resolved in trunk and 1.6 release branch. Each radio option gets an id created by concatenating "$id-$optValue".
