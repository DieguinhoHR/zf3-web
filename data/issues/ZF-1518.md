### Description

Not sure if this is a bug or feature, but the Zend\_Db adapters' describeTable() method seems to allow for silent failure. For example, with the pdo\_pgsql adapter, if the schema is incorrect, the method will return an empty array.

I would expect an exception to be thrown if describeTable() cannot successfully complete its assigned duty.

If instead the expected behavior for failure is to return an empty array, then this should be documented.
