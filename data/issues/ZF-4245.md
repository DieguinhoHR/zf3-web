### Description

I have captcha form element:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $captcha = new Zend_Form_Element_Captcha('captcha', array(
                'label' => "Please verify you're a human",
                'captcha' => array(
                'captcha' => 'Figlet',
                'wordLen' => 6,
                'timeout' => 300,
            ),));


When not fill the edit box, and submit form, I get "Captcha value is wrong" message, ok.

But if I now resend this form by pressing F5, or Ctrl+R, form is validated successfully with empty captcha text box !!!!

Here a test form and controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    class CaptchaForm extends Zend_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $captcha = new Zend_Form_Element_Captcha('captcha', array(
                'label' => "Please verify you're a human",
                'captcha' => array(
                'captcha' => 'Figlet',
                'wordLen' => 6,
                'timeout' => 300,
            ),));
            $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
            $this->addElements(array($captcha, $submit));
        }
    }
    
    class CaptchaTestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        function indexAction()
        {
            $form = new CaptchaForm(array(
                'action' => $this->view->url(array('controller' => 'captchatest')),
                'method' => 'post'));
    
            $this->view->form = $form;
    
            if($this->_request->getParam('submit'))
            {
                if ($form->isValid($this->_request->getParams()))
                {
                    echo "valid form";
                }
                else
                {
                    echo "invalid form";
                }
            }
        }
    }

upped to "Blocker" because this effectively renders Zend\_Captcha\_Figlet useless

This Problem occurs not only by using the Figlet Adapter. All Adapter shows the same behaviour. Hopefully we have a fix as soon as possible because this error make the whole ZEND\_CAPTCHA useless.

Thorsten is right, I can at least verify this for all Zend\_Captcha\_Word based implementations. I haven't tested Zend\_Captcha\_ReCaptcha yet.

The problem was actually in Zend\_Captcha\_Word. Comparison was too weak, the error occured because '' == null. Used the !== operator instead.

Added Unit test.

NOTE: BOTH MY PATCHES are relative to their respective parent directory, meaning the patch to Zend\_Captcha\_Word must be applied when in the /standard/trunk/library directory in SVN and the patch to Zend\_Captcha\_FigletTest must be applied in /standard/trunk/tests
