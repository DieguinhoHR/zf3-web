The issue tracker is not the correct place to ask for advice on how to use Zend Framework. Please search/post your question on the project mailing lists ([Available Lists](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Mailing+Lists), [Archive viewer](http://zend-framework-community.634137.n4.nabble.com/)), or use [StackExchange](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/zend-framework) or [zfforums.com](http://zfforums.com/)

I forgot to add that you can also ask for assistance in channel #zftalk of Freenode IRC. There is a web-based IRC client at <http://www.zftalk.com/> if you don't already have an IRC client.
