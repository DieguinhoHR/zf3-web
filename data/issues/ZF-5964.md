### Description

Hi.

I have structure of Resourses
-----------------------------

Parent1 - ( can be House #1) Child1 - ( can be Flat #1) Parent2 - ( can be House #2)

 Child1 - ( can be Flat #1)
---------------------------

So i can't do this 1: $acl->add(new Zend\_Acl\_Resource('Parent1')); 2: $acl->add(new Zend\_Acl\_Resource('Parent2'));

3: $acl->add(new Zend\_Acl\_Resource('Child1'),'Parent1'); 4: $acl->add(new Zend\_Acl\_Resource('Child1'),'Parent2');

While complie i see message Child1 allready present in resource list - error in line 4.

Thanks.

Hi,

I would expect the resources to behave in a similar way to the roles. Is there a concrete reason this was implemented as is? I mean, was the before mentioned case simply overlooked or is there a more subtle reason.

Regards, Peter

I actually have a hard time understanding the use case where resources need to be inherited from multiple parents aside from the more technical demonstration in the issue report. Do you have a real world use case?

While this might be a worthwhile feature, the ZF team will not develop this feature, but if a community member would like to pick up and develop it, they may make an assignment of it.

When imagining one flat being part of 2 houses is indeed quite hard, a real life situation would be to define access control based through different paths.

For example when defining a road to be both a side-walk and a cycleway Or maybe a room to be a lecture room and a project room

Does this example make the issue a little clearer?

Parent1 - ( is Condo #1 ) Child1 - ( is Swimming Pool ) Parent2 - ( is Condo #2 ) Child1 - ( is Swimming Pool )

There is only one swimming pool in the condo complex. To get access to the swimming pool you must have access to one or more condos.

Resources are arranged as a tree, a tree node can not have > 1 parent.

The interface "Resource" has a method "getResourceId()". According to the architecture of Zend\_Acl, this ID should be unique (identity pattern).
