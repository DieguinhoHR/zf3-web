ZF-807: Zend\_Auth - Login vs. Identity
---------------------------------------

### Description

In keeping with the idea that Zend\_Auth is used to authenticate, or identify, the requester, the name of the isLoggedIn() method is suggested to change to hasIdentity(), which may be more clear. If a requester has not been identified through authentication, then hasIdentity() returns false. Only if a requester has successfully authenticated would hasIdentity() return true.

Also, the logout() method would accordingly be changed to something like removeIdentity().

In light of ZF-806 this makes sense.

Resolved with SVN [r3412](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=3412).

I might suggest distinguishing between authentication identities (e.g. username used with a password), and authorization identities (e.g. user id from the primary key column in the users table). The mere presence of an authorization identity is sufficient to indicate authentication previously succeeded.
