### Description

There is a bug in one of the quickstart scripts: "resources" not "resource !

Just a missing "s" in the end. Please change it. Thank a lot. Bye

Found on: [http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)

; application/configs/application.ini

; Add these lines to the appropriate sections: [production] resource.db.adapter = "PDO\_SQLITE" resource.db.params.dbname = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook.db"

[testing : production] resource.db.params.dbname = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook-testing.db"

[development : production] resource.db.params.dbname = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/db/guestbook-dev.db"
