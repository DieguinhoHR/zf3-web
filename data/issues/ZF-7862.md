ZF-7862: Zend\_Uri\_Http::setQuery() returns old query string
-------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-09-16T09:22:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-09-21T05:05:33.000+0000 Status: Postponed Fix version(s):

### Description

Why does Zend\_Uri\_Http::setQuery() return the old query string? I don't expect this behaviour and

Zend\_Uri\_Http::getQuery() does the same with the difference being that this method performs this check:

return strlen($this->\_query) > 0 ? $this->\_query : false;

To me this interface seems to be quite odd.
-------------------------------------------

{color:gray} Note1: It seems like this oddity slipped in via <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-351>

Note 2: This ticket spawned from a thread at [http://nabble.com/Why-does-Zend\_URI%3A%3AsetQuery-â€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Why-does-Zend_URI%3A%3AsetQuery-return-old-query-string--td25473629.html.%7Bcolor)}

This could be a refactoring ticket for 2.0.

Along with this request, I'd rather see a fluent interface -- like many components provide:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $uri->setConfig($foo)->setQuery('foo')->setScheme('http');


Then, I'd also like isValid() instead of valid. Follows the validator pattern and the accepted convention that the method name is prefixed with is when they return booleans.

I agree, but the API will not change until 2.0

BTW I think Zend\_Uri should get a major face lift for 2.0, including some big functionality and purpose changes, separation of all validation work to a Zend\_Validate component, support for different URL schemes (even partial URIs and arbitrary schemas), resolving of relative URLs etc.

I made a proposal for that and even wrote some code but without API breakage this is almost impossible, so I dropped it.

Shahar.
