### Description

I chose "unknown" in the component as Zend\_Tool isn't listed.

I get the following after running: zf create project

"Exception: RecursiveDirectoryIterator::\_\_construct(./Zend): failed to open dir: No such file or directory"

inside my project folder i have: 'application' 'library' '.zfproject.xml'

no folder public, no index.php

yes, my include path is correct, as i am able to run: zf show verison and it comes back fine

This has been addressed in trunk by other fixes.
