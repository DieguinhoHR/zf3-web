ZF2-36: Multiple brokers initialization
---------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-07-18T13:46:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-31T15:50:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

If we have broker customization with next config:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resource_broker.class = "ZendTest\Application\TestAsset\ResourceBroker"
    resource_broker.options.enabled = true


and after that we try to set application options by next code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $application->getBootstrap()->setOptions(array('test'=>true));


application broker would be overwritten by new instance of broker.

That happens because in Zend\\Application\\AbstractBootstrap.php method setOptions() after next line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $options = $this->_options;


all previous options merged with new set of options goes to initialization once more.

Can you verify that this is true in current master? There were a number of changes around a week ago that may have corrected this.
