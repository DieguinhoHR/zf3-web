### Description

Hello,

I think there is a problem when we request only one specific part. Actually, there is a comparison between id requested and id answered by imap server. If i fetch for exemple this one on Dovecot:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        C: 6 FETCH 19 (BODY.PEEK[1])


I get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        S: * 4827313 FETCH (BODY[1]...


Please notice the lack of ".PEEK".

If I look at RFC 3501 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-7.4.2>), there is no "BODY.PEEK" listed in the response of a fetch. So, i think Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap must take this in consideration, if some Imap servers dont answers full "BODY.PEEK".

Here is a workaround :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($tokens[2][0] == $items[0] || $tokens[2][0] == str_replace('BODY.PEEK[', 'BODY[', $items[0])) {
    ...


I also notice that if we fetch one part in array, the function still answer a string. I think it's not right : if we pass a array for parameters $from, we are waiting for an array. If we passe a string, so get a string. Maybe it's another bug ?
