ZF-1215: Enable developers to create dates from date parts, and obtain date parts from dates.

### Description

If Zend\_Date provided public (i.e. PHP public) methods for obtaining the parts of a date and creating dates from these parts, then ZF developers would have an alternative to PHP's mktime() and getdate() that work well with Zend\_Date objects. There are many ways to enable such functionality in Zend\_Date.

Reasons for supporting these two methods in Zend\_Date include:

Convenience (developers don't have to extract timestamps, use PHP's functions, and then create a new Zend\_Date object)
=======================================================================================================================

Consistency (Zend\_Date API becomes more complete and consistent)
=================================================================

Allows developers to do more with Zend\_Date, without subclassing Zend\_Date (i.e. convenience, and portability of code - code can be shared easier with other ZF projects)
===========================================================================================================================================================================

PHP functions do not support 64-bit timestamps, but Zend\_Date does support 64-bit timestamps, which is a very cool feature :)
==============================================================================================================================

to 1) Why should a user use PHP's functions.... Zend\_Date has all a user needs. to 2) Zend\_Date is consistent... the API is feature rich, simple to use and has no known problems. to 3) Zend\_Date has more than 100 functions... I dont think that "more" is necessary to 4) it's PHP's fault not to support 64bit timestamps ;-)

I will not give access to the internal mktime or getdate function to prevent the illusion that they are 100% identical to the php functions.

But I see the possible benefit to have Zend\_Date extracted as array and have an array as input. First is already implemented with getDateParts() and will become public. For the details on the second I have to think about.

1) Agreed, but it would be nice if the developer had easier access (no need to create subclasses) :) 2) Zend\_Date API is missing public methods equivalent to PHP's mkdate() and getdate(). 3) 100 functions, but see 2) above. 4) Agreed!

Yes, there are many ways to provide 2) above that do not require exposing internal functions. It would be convenient if Zend\_Date had a method similar to getdate() and the output of this method could be used as input to Zend\_Date's method for creating date objects from these parts.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateParts = Zend_Date::now()->getArrayOfDateParts();
    $dateObject = Zend_Date::mkDateObject($dateParts);


I chose silly long method names to avoid confusion with any existing methods. The public methods could be all new, or some type of proxy to internal methods, or by making an internal method public. I am only trying to suggest the usefulness of allowing the output of one function to be used as the input for the other function (making date objects).

We will include this feature after the release of 1.0.

Added the new function toArray() which returns an array representation of the actual date object. Equal to PHP's getDate() function.

Integrated with SVN 5613

Creation of dates from an array will come in the future.

Added the possibility to use arrays as input values for all methods which accept date input values.

Included with SVN-5618
