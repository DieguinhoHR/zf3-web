### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.row.html#zend.db.table.row.extending.overriding)

the protected function init() doesn't work as written in the example. i think this should be a public function instead...?

The method in the class definition is public, so yes; there is a documentation error : the method in doc should be written as public. However, I think that this method should be set protected in the class, shouldn't it ?

I don't know, but I do know that protected function init() doesn't work right now ;-)

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

I extended a row class and created a protected init() function according to the documentation at <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3007>

I get the following error: Fatal error: Access level to Player\_Row::init() must be public (as in class Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract)

Changing the init() function to public corrects the error.

The documentation should be changed or the error should not be thrown.
