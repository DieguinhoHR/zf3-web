ZF-3239: 'From' table not available in $\_parts in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select

### Description

As described in [\#ZF-3235](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3235) it would be desirable to have access to the source table information in a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select instance. The current implementation sets the "from" information in the \_\_toString() method, after which it's available in the $\_parts array and thus accessible via getPart(). It would make sense to have the "from" information available in $\_parts directly after the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select object has been instantiated. Attached is a modified Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select which provides an idea to a possible solution. There's a new method \_setParts(), which loads some information into the $\_parts array. This is copied from \_\_toString().

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

I'd like the priority of this issue to be reconsidered... Because the way Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select works the Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect can't utilize the existing method of modifying the provided select query. Currently it's done like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $expression = new Zend_Db_Expr('COUNT(*) AS ' . self::ROW_COUNT_COLUMN);
    
    $rowCount   = clone $this->_select;
    $rowCount->reset(Zend_Db_Select::COLUMNS)
                         ->columns($expression);


However, at this point the FROM part is not yet know and can't be altered. The expression is used as argument for the columns() method, but this gets overwritten again in the assemble method. The only solution at the moment is to modify the query string in case of a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select. This is absolutely not desirable. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select should basically function the same way as Zend\_Db\_Select.

Attached is a patch that sets the FROM clause directly on instantiating the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select object. This is done in the setTable part:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setTable(Zend_Db_Table_Abstract $table)
    {
        $this->_adapter = $table->getAdapter();
        $this->_info    = $table->info();
        
        $primary = $this->_info[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::NAME];
        $schema  = $this->_info[Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::SCHEMA];
        $this->from($primary, self::SQL_WILDCARD, $schema);
        
        return $this;
    }


The code used is directly copied from the assemble method, so it could be argued that some code there has become redundant.

I have tested the modified select query with Zend\_Paginator and it now works the same as a Zend\_Db\_Select query. As far as I could find and run a unit test for this class (installing and configuring XDebug kinda messed with my PHPUnit's output) there don't seem to be any problems (at least no failed tests).

This issue should be fixed in time for ZF 1.6 RC1, so people can get the best Paginator experience ;)

This bug also prevents using Zend\_Db\_Select::columns(), before the select has been converted to a string at least once:

??Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Db\_Select\_Exception' with message 'No table has been specified for the FROM clause' in /home/jaka/sites/iadmin.kubje.org/wcs/trunk/src/library/Zend/Db/Select.php:224??

Even the examples from the manual do not work because of this bug:

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.qry.rows.set.integrity.example)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Bugs();
    
    $select = $table->select()->setIntegrityCheck(false);
    $select->where('bug_status = ?', 'NEW')
           ->join('accounts', 'accounts.account_name = bugs.reported_by', 'account_name')
           ->where('accounts.account_name = ?', 'Bob');


This would cause an SQL error ??Unknown column 'bug\_status' in 'where clause?? since the Bugs table itself wouldn't even be included in the select query, unless echoed out first.

(sorry to double-post) To be more precise: \_\_toString() would have to run before doing the join(), otherwise "accounts" is not joined to bugs, but the only table used for the select.

Jurrien's patch has a minor BC problem (if I understand everything correctly):

Currently, if you select only some columns, then only those would be returned, since \* is added before converting to string ONLY if no columns are selected.

With Jurrien's patch, \* would always be selected, unless explicitly removed using reset(Zend\_Db\_Select::COLUMNS).

In addition to Jurrien's change, I propose: - adding a protected variable $\_wildcardSelectedByDefault. This would then get set to true in setTable() at the same time as ?$this->from($primary, self::SQL\_WILDCARD, $schema)? - override columns() to remove ?self::SQL\_WILDCARD? from columns and set \_wildcardSelectedByDefault to false if setting columns for the primary table and $\_wildcardSelectedByDefault is true.

This way \* is selected unless columns() is called explicitly, and the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select object always reflects the current "state" (columns that will actually be selected).

I will be testing this solution during the next week. If anyone has any other suggestions/worries, please speak :)

Reassigned this issue to myself. I should be able to dig up an email conversation I had with Simon regarding this issue. Together with the comments in this post I should be able to fix this without BC breakage.

Resolved in r. 13530

Reverted in r. 13749 because of BC issues

The solution of ZF-2798 is also a solution for this issue.

Since 1.9 there has been a feature in place that allowed select() to be called on a table with that will load the from part into the object.

Please see [here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.html#zend.db.table.qry.rows.set.refine.example), and the api doc [here](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/Zend_Db/Table/Zend_Db_Table_Abstract.html#methodselect)

I think it might fix this problem.

I got this error today on Version 2.10.6. Is this bug fixed or not?
