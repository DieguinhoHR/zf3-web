ZF-7503: Incorrect inflection when creating an action through zf.bat

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    c:\xampp\htdocs\abc>zf create action noPrivilegies error 1 default
    Creating an action named noPrivilegies inside controller at c:\xampp\htdocs\abc/application/modules/default/controllers/ErrorController.php
    Updating project profile 'c:\xampp\htdocs\abc/.zfproject.xml'
    Creating a view script for the noPrivilegies action method at c:\xampp\htdocs\abc/application/modules/default/views/scripts/error/noPrivilegies.phtml
    Updating project profile 'c:\xampp\htdocs\abc/.zfproject.xml'


As you can see the view script created does not match the default inflection rules for view scripts. When I try to go to the action it complains that the viewscript no-privilegies.phtml does not exist.

Improved formatting

This was fixed as part of 1.10 when "canonical naming" was introduced. If you still feel there is an issue (although I just tested this scenario), please reopen.
