### Description

Some parameters have been added and removed from Twitter's API, ie, HTTP "X-Modified-Since" header doesn't seem to be honored and is replaced by a "since\_id" REST parameter.

The other new parameters are:

- user\_id
- screen\_name
- max\_id

I think it may be improvement or new feature

It's definitely a bug - the method is almost useless with the current API
