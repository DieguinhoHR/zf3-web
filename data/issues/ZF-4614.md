see ZF-3490 : For the memcached backend, there is a lifetime limit of 30 days (2592000 seconds)

so we should transform null to 2592000 (instead of 0), shouldn't we ?

I think you should stay with null to 0. This is value expected by PHP's Memcache module.

Maybe the people from Memcached ships a new version supporting a longer lifetime, this way, passing 0 will guarantee the max allowed lifetime without changing the code.
