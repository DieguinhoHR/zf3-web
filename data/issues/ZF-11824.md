### Description

The public method for test() doesn't allow you to set whether to test against the time as the protected method \_test() does.

Suggested fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function test($id, $doNotTestCacheValidity = false)
        {
            clearstatcache();
            return $this->_test($id, $doNotTestCacheValidity);
        }

The public method "test" only has one argument defined by Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface and can't be changed.
