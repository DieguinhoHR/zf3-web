ZF-2043: Unappealing From header

### Description

When a letter is sent and the message does not provide a name for the sender then the From-header is set with empty brackets.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail->setFrom('adress@mail.ca');


Results as From : "" [adress@mail.ca](mailto:adress@mail.ca)

One would expect the from-header not to include empty brackets "".

The setFrom function of the Zend\_Mail class should be changed as follows

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    /**
    * Sets From-header and sender of the message
    *
    * @param  string    $email
    * @param  string    $name     optional
    * @return Zend_Mail Provides fluent interface
    * @throws Zend_Mail_Exception if called subsequent times
    */
    public function setFrom($email, $name = '')
    {
            if ($this->_from === null) {
                $email = strtr($email,"\r\n\t",'???');
                $this->_from = $email;
    
                if ($name != '') {
                    $name = '"' . $this->_encodeHeader($name) . '" ';
                }
    
                $this->_storeHeader('From', $name .' <'.$email.'>', true);
            } else {
                throw new Zend_Mail_Exception('From Header set twice');
            }
            return $this;
    }

As the second parameter is optional I suggest setting $name = null and verifying whether $name === null to be conform with "PHP Coding Standard (draft) -> Optional Parameters".

One more thing: if name is given you're currently adding two spaces between name and email address. A possible variant, IMO also easier to read could be:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    public function setFrom($email, $name = null)
    {
        if ($this->_from === null) {
            $email = strtr($email,"\r\n\t",'???');
            $this->_from = $email;
    
            if (null === $name) {
                $from = sprintf('"%s" ', $this->_encodeHeader($name));
            } else {
                $from = '';
            }
            $from .= sprintf('<%s>', (string) $email);
            $this->_storeHeader('From', $from, true);
        } else {
            ...


Cheers, Thomas

Sorry for nitpicking, could not resist ;-)

Hello, Thomas. You are welcome.;-) Thank You for Your advice.

I refixed as following.

1) If $name is not used or the $name is same as $email, header is "From: $email".

2) If $name is used and the $name is encoded, header is "From: $name <$email>".

3) If $name is used and the $name is not encoded and not contains comma, header is "From: $name <$email>".

4) If $name is used and the $name is not encoded and contains comma, header is "From: "$name" <$email>".

Best Regards, Satoru Yoshida

Great. One last note: Wouln't 1) better be From: <$email> ?

Sorry, my fault. "From: user@domain.tld" is correct.

Hi, Thomas.

Thank You for checking my comment.

Yes, both "From: user@domain.tld" and "From: [user@domain.tld](mailto:user@domain.tld)" are correct.

I selected "From: user@domain.tld" on implementation. :-)
