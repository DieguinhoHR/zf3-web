### Description

I'm trying to use Zend\_Date->subTime(), but it keeps giving me an exception. Now I could very well be misusing this functionality as for it isn't documented in the reference guide.

Exception:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$ php5 test.php
    
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Date_Exception' with message 'Unknown date format, neither date nor time in 'c' found' in /home/dolf/Projects/.ZS4E.Workspace/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/Zend/Date.php:2687
    Stack trace:
    #0 /home/dolf/Projects/.ZS4E.Workspace/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/Zend/Date.php(2753): Zend_Date->_time('sub', '2009-07-01', 'c', NULL)
    #1 /home/dolf/Projects/.ZS4E.Workspace/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/test.php(5): Zend_Date->subTime('2009-07-01', 'c')
    #2 {main}
      thrown in /home/dolf/Projects/.ZS4E.Workspace/ZF-Standard-Trunk/library/Zend/Date.php on line 2687

Code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$ cat test.php
    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Date.php';
    $date = new Zend_Date('2009-07-11 21:07:46',Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    
    echo $date->subTime('2009-07-01',Zend_Date::ISO_8601);

This was done on trunk

According to API doc the method subTime() substracts the time part of a date from the actual set date.

But you did not gave a time part, only a date part... as no time part has been found in your input a exception is thrown.
