ZF-2425: Hostnames with arbitrary characters such as space are valid when ALLOW\_LOCAL is set

### Description

When validating a hostname with ALLOW\_LOCAL, like in the following code, host names containing invalid characters such as space, '!' and so on are valid:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $v = new Zend_Validate_Hostname(Zend_Validate_Hostname::ALLOW_LOCAL);
    var_dump($v->isValid('www foo com'));


This is because of a mistake in the $regexLocal regular expression, which uses \\x2e to mark '.' but this sequence is being resolved by PHP before preg compilation - so it behaves like an unescaped '.' in a regex - meaning any character is allowed instead of the dot separator.

The fix is easy - replace the double quotes encapsulating the regex with single quotes.

BTW this really makes our unit tests look poor.
