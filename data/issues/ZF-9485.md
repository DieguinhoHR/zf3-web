### Description

Commonly I see syntax like:

@return PDO\_Statement|Zend\_Db\_Statement Everytime I get your updates I go in and change to:

@return Zend\_Db\_Statement | PDO\_Statement Is it a lot to ask for a valid doc block that works with my IDE's code completion? I don't know that your method is even valid.

Found that example in Zend\_Db\_Select (line 678).

Why not have one select subclass for PDO people, and another subclass for Zend\_Db people, so everyone's code completions work everywhere consistently?

The OR operator is a valid annotation, and is actually primarily for use with phpDocumentor in compiling our API docs. I'm actually unsure if adding spaces around the operator will work with phpDocumentor; my recollection is that it may not.

Would you be willing to do a test to see if phpDocumentor respects whitespace around the OR operator? If it does, we can fix this with some simple find+sed scripts.

I went and read up on this:

" If you want to explicitly show multiple possible return types, list them pipe-delimited without spaces (e.g. "@return int|string")."

I guess we should not deviate from that even if it happens to work, because we would have no guarantee of forwards compatibility.

It would be nice if the ZF team could put together a list of "recommended IDEs" though. (I'm sure Zend inc. would not turn down the chance to put their own product on that list)

Closing as non-issue.

As mentioned above we should not change the docblocks as the standard is used (without spaces)
