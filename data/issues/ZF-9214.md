ZF-9214: Allowing non complex types (WSDL XSD) in WSDL output.

### Description

Currently, the types that are catered for within the PHP->Zend->WSDL process are limited to PHP types and complex types comprised on PHP types.

Considering that the WSDL file can act as a contract between the client and the server, allowing for the standard types as defined in [http://w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/â€¦](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/datatypes.html#built-in-datatypes) would seem to be a worthwhile step.

The patch I've attached allows the server to supply a class name to Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover. The default is Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl, so backwards compatability is maintained.

The class must be a subclass of Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl. By overriding Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl::getType() in the subclass, you can allow for additional types.

In my case, a subset of the W3C XSD data types.

This allows the WSDL file to be generated with the W3C XSD types being used in the DocBlocks for the SOAP service.

It does NOT deal with the content of the properties purporting to be these types. It is just to make a WSDL file.

This patch will allow you to subclass Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl and supply the name of the subclass to Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover to allow you to define additional non-complex types by overriding Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl::getType() and calling the parent::getType() if the requested type is not known.

Example of a Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl subclass.

Example usage (just a snippet) of the use of the $wsdlClass parameter in the constructor of Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscover.
