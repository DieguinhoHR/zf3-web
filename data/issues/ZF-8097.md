ZF-8097: getValues only returns some values when using array notation in setElementsBelongsTo 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The getValues method only returns the last key in the array for sub forms of the same name. Finding it quite difficult to put into words so I will explain with a code sample.

$form = new Zend\_Form();

$subForm1 = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm(); $subForm1->setElementsBelongTo("fields[0]"); $form->addSubForm($subForm1, "fields\_0");

$subForm2 = new Zend\_Form\_SubForm(); $subForm2->setElementsBelongTo("fields[1]"); $form->addSubForm($subForm2, "fields\_1");

After form submission and validation, the key "fields" contains only the values for $subForm2. This is because the values are merged using array\_merge rather than array\_merge\_recursive.

ZF-9586 is similar, could you try if that works for you?

Resolving as duplicate of ZF-9586
