### Description

The example code for a multi-page form ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.advanced.html#zend.form.advanced.multiPage)) suggests adding "public function setSubFormDecorators(Zend\_Form\_SubForm $subForm)" to the Zend\_Form\_Extension it tells you to make, but Zend\_Form (and so Zend\_Form\_SubForm) already has a method with that name, that type-hints an array as its argument, and does something completely different. Renaming it to something else (I'm using "setDecoratorsForSubForm", which is still a bit confusing...) would prevent confusion/errors
