Did you happen to use include('./header.phtml'); on windows?

This does not look like a ZF problem but a php issue. Let me know if telling the include to look in the current directory works.

Can you please check and make sure the include\_path variable in your php.ini is set correctly on windows (it's set differently on Linux and windows). If you sill have this problem please reopen the ticket and provide some example code or a unit test so we can reproduce the error.
