### Description

I'd like to be able to use array access instead of object access sometimes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$row = $Users->findRow(1);
    echo $row['user']; // instead of echo $row->user;

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Re-opening this issue... it's not a duplicate! This one's about Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row, while the other is about Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset
