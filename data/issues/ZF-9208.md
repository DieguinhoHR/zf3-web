ZF-9208: Shutdown procedure causes PHP fatal error

### Description

I get the following fatal error after the script end, i.e. during the shutdown procedure. This is caused by the Zend\_Search\_Lucene::\_\_destruct() function. I think this is a design bug because exception cannot be thrown during shutdown phase, and the code involved in the \_close() procedure might actually rise them. There is also a way to call \_close() more than once, by invoking Zend\_Search\_Lucene::addReference() and then Zend\_Search\_Lucene::removeReference() (causing the refcount to go to 1 and then 0 again, triggering the \_close() call). My point is: don't use \_\_destruct() at all, php would free all resources anyway after script execution.
