### Description

Wouldn't it be nice to enable the developer/user to get an overview of all project specific providers, which were initiated/generated with the create action of the Project and ProjectProvider provider, by providing him a show action in the ProjectProvider provider.

Something like 'zf show project-provider /path/to/project' or in case the developer/user is already in the project directory a more simple 'zf show project-provider'.
