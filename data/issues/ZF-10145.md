### Description

Zend\_AMF\_Server include an authentication & an authorization part based on Zend\_Auth & Zend\_ACL.

Zend\_SOAP\_Server & Zend\_REST\_Server doesn't include authentication & authorization... This is really missing.

Example : I have a Service\_User class & methods CRUD with other specifics methods like "getUserBooks" or "getallowedUsers".

CRUD functions shouldn't be public, because they involve database integrity; counter to specifics methods.

SOAP / REST Server can take functions or classes. It could be really usefull to setup some ACL on this methods or services..

That all folks.

In what way are authentication & authorization part of the SOAP protocol specification or the REST architectural style?
