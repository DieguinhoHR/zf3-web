### Description

For example [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html) has so much content, orientation is difficult. Scrolling up every time I want to see outline is annoying.

If Page navigation will be still visible no matter where I am in the document, orientation will be much more efficient. Some CSS like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    position:fixed;
    top:10px;
    right:10px;
    overflow: scroll;
    height: 600px;


or something similar for

<

div> which wraps Page Navigation will be sufficient.
