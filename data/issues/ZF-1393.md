### Description

The documentation of the Attachments in Zend\_Mail is mainly about the addAttachment() method whereas it should be the createAttachment() method. If you look at addAttachment in Zend/Mail.php you'll see that the argument should be a Zend\_Mime\_Part object.

 
    public function addAttachment(Zend_Mime_Part $attachment)
    {
        $this->addPart($attachment);
        $this->hasAttachments = true;
    
        return $this;
    }


But the documentation says that it should a binary string "$mail->addAttachment($myImage, 'image/gif', Zend\_Mime::DISPOSITION\_INLINE, Zend\_Mime::ENCODING\_8BIT);". These arguments match to the createAttachment() method and therefore this should be used instead of the addAttachment() in the documentation.

 
    public function createAttachment($body,
                                     $mimeType    = Zend_Mime::TYPE_OCTETSTREAM,
                                     $disposition = Zend_Mime::DISPOSITION_ATTACHMENT,
                                     $encoding    = Zend_Mime::ENCODING_BASE64,
                                     $filename    = null)
    {
    
        $mp = new Zend_Mime_Part($body);
        $mp->encoding = $encoding;
        $mp->type = $mimeType;
        $mp->disposition = $disposition;
        $mp->filename = $filename;
    
        $this->addAttachment($mp);
    
        return $mp;
    }
