### Description

If there is more than one instance running in EC2, Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Ec2\_Instance's describe will only return the last in the reservation set.

This is because onn line 253 the instances array is created and also replaces itself every time a reservation item is looped through.

The reservation id is also replaced since the data structure only allows one.

Yes I found this issue while doing [ZF-6717](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6717) and it has since been fixed in my user branch and will be released with that update. It should be in 1.8.4.

This has been fixed in my user branch were I'm working on the update to the API version.

This was done with r16390 as it was part of the update to the describeInstance method.
