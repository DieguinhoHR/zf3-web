ZF-3758: Add PUT Inlinefile

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2008-07-25T07:24:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-03-20T03:45:54.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.0 (30/Apr/09)

### Description

HTTP PUT a file inline would be great. It should do something like curl did with this:

$fin = fopen( $filename, 'r' ); $ch = curl\_init(); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_PUT,1); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_URL, $res['path']); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_VERBOSE, 0); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_INFILE, $fin); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_INFILESIZE, filesize($filename)); curl\_setopt($ch,CURLOPT\_TIMEOUT, 4); curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, true); if(!curl\_exec($ch)) { $this->error=curl\_error($ch); curl\_close($ch); return false; } curl\_close($ch);

You can currently do this by: // Uploading an existing file $this->httpClient->setRawData(file\_get\_contents($filename), ''); // Send the files $this->httpClient->request('PUT');

This feature should work something like this: $this->httpClient->setEncType(Zend\_Http\_Client::ENC\_NONE); $this->httpClient->setFileUpload($filename); //Compared to the existing functionality, you can only ad one file for Inline PUT $this->httpClient->request('PUT');

Putting file inline is for example needed for implementing the MogileFS protocol.

In my opinion things should not be duplicated.

Zend\_File\_Transfer handles (will handle) all variants of file upload and downloads. And it supports different adapters, also PUT, POST or even FTP.

Thomas I did not know about Zend\_File\_Transfer. It looks like what I need. But in my point of view Zend\_File\_Transfer's HTTP-Adapters should use Zend\_Http\_Client as Backend, but I might be wrong on this.

You're wrong at these. It should not use Zend\_Http\_Client as it does provide much more functionallity. Zend\_Http\_Client does not provide handling on validators or filters, it does not provide access to ftp, webdav and so on. Zend\_File\_Transfer will for example allow to upload per PUT and upload per FTP to another server automatically. This is not possible when using Zend\_Http\_Client.

Zend\_Http\_Client is meant to work as Http Client... which is a sort of browser. Nothing more. Zend\_File\_Transfer is intended to do something completly different. Also framework components should be coded in a way where they do NOT extend each other when it's not necessary.

As I said, I absolutly love Zend\_File\_Transfer. I think it's a great concept and I'm looking forward to use it.

I do not see very deep in the ZF development process, but for me Zend\_Http\_Client is a implementation of the HTTP Protocol from the client side. As I assume it's this, it has in my point of view to implement a full HTTP client regarding the standard (the reason for this "New Feature" request). As I do assume that Zend\_Http\_Client is implementing the HTTP Protocol I think the protocol (or part of it) should not implement again within the framework. Therefor I personaly think Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Protocol\_Http should use (not extend) Zend\_Http\_Client. But again, I do not have a very deep insight into the ZF development process and I might be wrong with my thoughts.

{quote}As I said, I absolutly love Zend\_File\_Transfer. I think it's a great concept and I'm looking forward to use it. {quote} Great to hear :-)

As you noted Zend\_Http\_Client is an implementation of a Clientside HTTP Part. And Zend\_File\_Transfer is an implementation of the Serverside for File Transfer.

So they do completly different things. Also to mention, when anyone want to do file transfer he must then also use Zend\_Http\_Client to get it working. This is exactly what we want not to have... the components should be seperated as long as they do not really extend each other.

Http\_Client implements much more and completly different methods and things than used in file transfer... and in my eyes it would be a complete bunch of overhead if we would extend Http\_Client just for file transfer which is in it's simplest way a validation of the $\_FILES array and moving the files. :-)

I would really not know where to use Http\_Client... it has no validators, no filters, no protocol other than http, there is no connection for different protocols, no handling of down/uploaded files... it's really a completly differerent class :-)

I dont understand what the problem is on this issue, since even the socket client supports PUTing a file with the described $client->setRawData(file\_get\_contents('bla.txt')); $client->request('PUT'); method.

Therefore Http Client already supports this feature and this issue is not really needed.

Ok, i understand this is being an important issue for large files that should not fit into a PHP string. The current Incubator Version of the Curl Adapter supports this behaviour, and its being enforced by a Unittest. Can you check and confirm if the unit-test Zend\_Http\_Client\_CurlTest::testPutFileContentWithHttpClient() functionality is the one you need?

The problem is not into functionality. I'm fine with first read the data with file\_get\_contents.

The problem is more that it looks like setRawData seems to not realy concepted for that (that is what you also might see in that you has to pass a second empty string). It might be hard for somebuddy to find out that he has to use the method "setRawData" if he want to upload a file. And in my point of view setFileUpload should not only work for POST but also for PUT and it should give a reasonable message if the http method does not allow to upload files.

You might see this is more of a API naming thing then a technical problem.

I think having direct file transfer capacity in Z\_H\_C would be great. Imagine you need to upload 100M file to somewhere like Amazon S3. Right now only way to do it with Z\_H\_C is to read whole thing in memory and then POST/PUT it. But nobody really needs this 100M hog in memory, if only we had the standard way to stream it out (and, consequently, in). Zend\_File\_Transfer is nice but seems to be meant for entirely different things. Ability to stream files without loading them in memory seems natural extension to Z\_H\_C capabilities.

@Stanislav: You miss one thing... Zend\_HTTP\_Client is for... HTTP... Zend\_File\_Transfer supports multiple protocols like FTP, WEBDAV and so on additionally to HTTP. ZFT is build for file transfer... for nothing different.

And you don't need to have the complete file in memory to send it. I don't know from where you have this information, but for ZFT this is not true.

Also, as I already said in a past comment: Zend\_File\_Transfer is a server component and Zend\_Http\_Client simulates a Client... this are two different things.

Is closed with the inclusion of cURL Adapter in trunk, to be released in 1.8
