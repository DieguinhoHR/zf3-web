### Description

When working with file uploads in Zend\_Form you have to call receive on every file element.

For simplicity it would be nice when we have a receive() method in Zend\_Form which would proxy to the file elements receive() method.

So instead of

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$form->file1->receive()) { 
        print_r($form->file1->getMessages());
        exit; 
    }  
    if (!$form->file2->receive()) { 
        print_r($form->file2->getMessages());
        exit; 
    }  


a simple

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$form->receive()) { 
        print_r($form->getMessages());
        exit; 
    }  


would be enough. Especially usefull when working with much file upload elements.

We will not add functionality to Zend\_Form for handling specific element types; this will only cause feature creep and eventually make the component less extensible.

I thought more of a way to call functions of an element from within form... a sort of rerouter if the method is not available in form itself... so it will try to call this function on the registered elements if it's not avaiable in the form.

It would just simplify life. Was just an idea :-)
