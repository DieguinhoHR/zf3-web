### Description

It is disturbing to Frenchify the word "email" by "Émail", and leave invariant in the plural because the plural suffix "ail" is "aux". I would therefore replace it by "courriel" translation, or "adresse mail".

The specific case of the phrase "email list" by "liste de diffusion".

your zip file contains much more than documentation. Also, it is preferred that you generate just one patchfile of your entire changeset.

Michael told me what he prefers : "regarding the patches, the more little the simpler". It's easier for me to generate just one patchfile. I add unified patch to leave the choice to the person who will do.
