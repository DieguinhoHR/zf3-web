### Description

Documentation states:

The standard separator for CSV string is the ';' sign. But it has not to be that sign. With the option 'separator' you can decide to use another separator sign.

According to the actual "code", this word has changed to 'delimeter' but not updated in documentation.

This has already be changed two weeks ago with r9745. The new manual will be available with the new release. So please be patient.
