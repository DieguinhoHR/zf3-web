The test passes for me and I believe for Matthew as well.

Would you be able to trace why $channel->isReady() on line 117 in file /tests/Zend/Wildfire/WildfireTest.php returns false and provide me with more information?

Fixed in trunk and 1.6 release branch; was missing a call to Z\_C\_F::resetInstance() in tests.

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
