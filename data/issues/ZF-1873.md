### Description

There is a typo in the manual page for Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps. In Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps.xml, this:

 
    <pre class="literal"><?php
    $user = $gdata->retrieveUser('foo');
    $user->name->givenName = 'Foo';
    $user->name->familyName = 'Bar';
    $user = $gdata->save();
    ?>

needs to be changed to this:

 
    <pre class="literal"><?php
    $user = $gdata->retrieveUser('foo');
    $user->name->givenName = 'Foo';
    $user->name->familyName = 'Bar';
    $user = $user->save();
    ?>
