### Description

New Problem description - see my next comment

Old description -Hello,-

-i'm using Zend\_Paginator with the DbSelect adapter.-

-Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect connect to the database, although there is a connection.-

-Screenshots: -$dbLisp connects to the database to get the session.- -Afterwards I use $dbLisp-->select() to create the Zend\_Db\_Select object -> so it should also be connected, but Zend\_Paginator connect again.-

Zend\_Paginator and his adapter connects never to a database! This is the sole task of the database adapter.

Why is this issue critical?

Can you provide a complete example to reproduce the problem? Thanks.

I can not reproduce the problem:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Adapter
    $dbAdapter = new Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql(array(
        'host'     => 'localhost',
        'username' => 'foo',
        'password' => '',
        'dbname'   => 'bar',
        'profiler' => true,
    ));
    
    // Select for a general query
    $selectForGeneralQuery = new Zend_Db_Select($dbAdapter);
    $selectForGeneralQuery->from('baz')->limit(1);
    
    // Execute
    $dbAdapter->query($selectForGeneralQuery);
    
    // Select for paginator
    $selectForPaginator = new Zend_Db_Select($dbAdapter);
    $selectForPaginator->from('baz');
    
    // Paginator
    $paginator = Zend_Paginator::factory($selectForPaginator);
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber(1);
    
    // Execute
    $paginator->getItem(1);
    
    // Ouput
    foreach ($dbAdapter->getProfiler()->getQueryProfiles() as $query) {
        echo ($query->getQuery()) . "\n";
    }
    


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    connect
    SELECT `baz`.* FROM `baz` LIMIT 1
    SELECT COUNT(1) AS `zend_paginator_row_count` FROM `baz`
    SELECT `baz`.* FROM `baz` LIMIT 10

Okay i found the problem.

I store a copy of Zend\_Db\_Select in the cache (the select query).

In Zend\_Cache the PHP function "serialize" is called.

Serialize call the function "\_\_sleep" from Zend\_Db\_Select object, which is located in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract. Where the variable $this->\_connection is set to "false".

After that serialization the next query has to connect again.

This is a normal behaviour:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * called when object is getting serialized
     * This disconnects the DB object that cant be serialized
     *
     * @throws Zend_Db_Adapter_Exception
     * @return array
     */
    public function __sleep()
    {
        // ...
    }

Yes it is the normal behaviour.

But in my case it's a problem: I use an instance ob the "Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql" to operate with the database. Also i use this instance to create the "Zend\_Db\_Select".

After the "Zend\_Db\_Select" object get saved in the cache serialized, the "Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql" instance also lose the connection and have to reconnect, if querys are executed after the serialization.

So how can i save the "Zend\_Db\_Select" in the cache, without losing my connection?

Within one page request you use a cache?!

You do the following:

create a Zend\_Db\_Select-object
================================

save this select-object in cache
================================

fetch the object from the cache
===============================

execute the select-query
========================

Did I understand correctly?

Correct me, but I think point 2 and 3 are unnecessary.

{quote}So how can i save the "Zend\_Db\_Select" in the cache, without losing my connection?{quote} Extend the adapter class.

(By the way, I hope, you don't save the select-object in Zend\_Registry!)

I hope not, that i save it there ;-) No, i save it with Zend\_Cache in a file...

I explain it now a little bit further: I got a datagrid, where result data from the Zend\_Db\_Select are displayed. The datagrid got pagination, custom user filters and so on....

On the grid you have also the option to export the current displayed (and maybe filtered) data to PDF or Excel (without pagination/limit). So i have to take the last executed query from the user (which is saved in the cache) and remove the limit.

I know that another options would be to cache the last filters set, but i liked to work with the Zend\_Db\_Select object.

Save the Zend\_Db\_Select object in the cache as the last step of all operations. So you have only one connection to the database and with the next request you can get the same select object from the cache.

create a Zend\_Db\_Select-object
================================

execute the query
=================

...
===

save this select-object in cache - last step!
=============================================
