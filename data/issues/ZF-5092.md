### Description

If you set validators like the following, the size validator runs but the extension one does not. This might be because setName updates $\_name but remains update \_adapter -> \_files array. I am not sure whether it occurs with other form elements or not.

$element = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File('hoge'); $element->setDestination('/tmp') ->addValidator('Size', false, 1024) ->setName('foo') ->addValidator('Extension', false, 'jpg,png,gif') ;

I have a problem like this and maybe it's related... When i have $form->setName("formname") the validation doesn't work... but if i remove the setName it works... i fixed some forms by removing the name but i have a form where i really need the name on it and this is blocking my project... I'am using Zend\_Dojo\_Form and Zend 1.11.10... thx
