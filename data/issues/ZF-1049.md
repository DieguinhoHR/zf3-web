### Description

I've had some troubles using Zend\_Locale\_Format ::toFloat() along with setlocale().

Here is a sample code to illustrate the issue :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once('Zend/Loader.php');
    
    Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Locale');
    
    // setlocale(LC_ALL, 'fr_FR@euro');
    $locale_fr = new Zend_Locale('fr_FR');
    $locale_en = new Zend_Locale('en_US');
    $params_fr = array('precision' => 2, 'locale' => $locale_fr);
    $params_en = array('precision' => 2, 'locale' => $locale_en);
    $myFloat = 1234.5;
    $test1 = Zend_Locale_Format::toFloat($myFloat, $params_fr);
    $test2 = Zend_Locale_Format::toFloat($myFloat, $params_en);
    var_dump($test1);
    var_dump($test2);


The problem comes from the setlocale() call : if it is not present, everything goes fine but when I set PHP's locale to French, I can't get toFloat() to work.

Output _without_ setlocale() :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(9) "1 234,50" string(8) "1,234.50"


Output _with_ setlocale() :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(4) "0,00" string(4) "0.00"


The server I work on is a Linux box (Debian stable), and AFAIK, the standard locale is 'C'. I'm using PHP version 5.2.1 with the BCmath extension enabled. Regarding the framework, I had this problem while I was using the 0.8.0 version and it is still present in the 3912 SVN version.

Last thing, I quote a short part of Thomas' last answer on the mailing list :

??So toNumberFormat does not have to parse for the decimal point, because the input is not a string but a integer/float value.??

Are you 100% positive about that ? I'm saying that because when I see a piece of code like the following :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // get number parts
    if (iconv_strpos($value, '.') !== false) {


in toNumberFormat(), my first guess would be that you are actually looking for the decimal separator in the input value.

This seems to be confirmed by a short trace I ran on this part of code :

 
    <pre class="highlight">

                     }
                 }
    +           die('strpos true : ' . $precstr);
             } else {
                 if ($options['precision'] > 0) {
                     $precstr = str_pad("0", ($options['precision']), "0");
                 }
    +           die('strpos false : ' . $precstr);
             }
             if ($options['precision'] === null) {
                 if (isset($precstr)) {


Output _without_ setlocale() :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    strpos true : 50


Output _with_ setlocale() :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    strpos false : 00


Behaviour of this part of code is different whether the locale is set to French or not.

Hopefully there's enough information in this description, if not just let me know :)

I am sure.

Please try this code so we can see if iconv\_strpos works on your system:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $value = 12345.50;
    print "\n".$value;
    print "\n".iconv_strpos($value, '.');   
        setlocale(LC_ALL, 'fr_FR@euro');
    print "\n".$value;
    print "\n".iconv_strpos($value, '.');   


I see 2 possible problems: 1.) setLocale has false settings on your OS. 2.) BCMath is set to precision 0 within php.ini.

Just tried your code, here is the result :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    12345.5
    5
    12345,5


You were also right, bcmath's scale was indeed set to 0. My sysadmin changed it to 10 but the output stayed the same.

I know...

You have 2 problems. One which your sysadmin fixed. And one which I will fix ;-)

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-14T11:23:57.000+0000

I just committed a new version which should solve your problem if the php.ini settings are correct. (maximum precision settings) Please try SVN 3926 or higher.

I just tried with SVN version 3953.

Problem seems to be fixed, at least for the part in toNumberFormat(). However, I still can't get it to work when the locale is set to French.

I ran a few tests and it seems to me that Gavin's new implementation of the Zend\_Locale\_Math::round() method, which is called in toNumber(), may have broken your fix. For example, the value of $op1 after this block :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (($decPos = strpos($op1, '.')) === false) {
                $op1 .= '.0';
                $decPos = $length;
                $length += 2;
    }


is 1234,5.0 with setlocale() and 1234.5 without and this is the value that is used in toNumberFormat().

I know this... I've seen the problem after gavin changed my "tiny" ;-) implementation. I already wrote gavin about his fault... he will change it to work the same way like the old implementation.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-15T06:21:50.000+0000

Fix has been broken due to changes for ZF-1054. Please fix your fix.

The Zend\_Locale\_Math class is not locale-aware, nor should it be locale-aware. The Zend\_Locale\_Math class is a simple proxy between PHP functions and BCMath. BCMath is not locale-aware, and does not support thousands separator characters, or decimal separator characters other than a period ('.').

The previous implementation of Zend\_Locale\_Math::round() method failed on many cases (see unit test). The new implementation produces correct results for more than 200,000 test cases I tried.

Also, usually we should add a unit test before closing an issue.

Problem not reproducable.

Probably fixed with 3972. Changed internal handling of toNumber/-Format. See previous additionally comments from the devteam.

Reproducible on the [ZF Community Server](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Sandbox). Post request to fw-server@lists.zend.com to obtain an account.

Guillaume Millet, would you have time to test the patch attached to ZF-1061?

 

 

Posted by Guillaume Millet (gmillet) on 2007-03-19T04:50:57.000+0000

I can, but which version should I apply the patch on ?

Anyway, I gave a try at the SVN version 4108 and now the output of my test file changes from :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> *without* setlocale() to :


_with_ setlocale().

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-07-21T06:11:45.000+0000

Problems are solved with SVN 5806.

Could you please verify if it's working for you ?
