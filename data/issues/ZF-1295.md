### Description

Exist a particular reason to save expire timestamp in the cache file name ? If not the system must not search cached file

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        private function _file($id, $expire = null)
        {
            $path = $this->_path($id);
            if (is_null($expire)) {
                $glob = @glob($path . $this->_idToFileName($id, '*'));  //??????????????????
                $nbr = count($glob);
                if ($nbr == 1) {
                    return $glob[0];
                }
                return null;       
            }
            $fileName = $this->_idToFileName($id, $expire);
            return $path . $fileName;
        }


and on load a cache id this method will call on test expire date and on read file

It is superior to write the expire timestamp as first byte in the file -> better performance on test read only the first byte and unpack this to a integer and on load the opened file must not close after testing expire date

Are you sure about it ? Do you make some benchs ?

particulary when you do a clean with CLEANING\_MODE\_OLD

I have rewritten the class Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File but it is not tested yet. testing and bench comming soon

This class should fix ZF-1338, too.

new version

I write tags as serialized string a cache file named ".tag" The expirce time included as the first 4 bytes in the data file. The hash including data file, too (32 bytes after expire only is read control is enabled) The data file is named ".data"

now the tests pass without: testCleanModeOld & testGetWithAnExpiredCacheId this methods using public \_\_expire ????

A very simple bench using tests (only Zend\_Cache) like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $start = microtime(true);
    for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++) {
      AllTests::main();
    }
    echo "\n\nStart: $start\n";
    echo "End:".($end=microtime(true))."\n";
    echo ($end-$start)."\n";


result is:
