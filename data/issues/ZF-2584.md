Hi Darby, I gave a look at it yesterday and I already prepared a first draft.

I included the most important concepts from current Testing Standard page, I delegated other sections to external documents, for example [http://devzone.zend.com/article/…](http://devzone.zend.com/article/2772-An-Introduction-to-the-Art-of-Unit-Testing-in-PHP) [http://devzone.zend.com/article/…](http://devzone.zend.com/article/2955-Creating-Code-Coverage-Statistics-with-xdebug)

I think it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel when someone has already -written- invented it. ;)

Changing to comply with new IT coventions for components.

Closing issue. As mentioned before we should not reinvent the wheel.
