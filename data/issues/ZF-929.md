SVN 3512 should fix 5 of them.

The unit tests had switched parameters. The 6th test I must check because I did not make the mo file and I actualy used the spare time while the code freeze to upgrade my machine to PHP5.2.1 and Apache 2.2.4.

It will need some hours to get it all back to work again, so I can check the 6th issue.

Solved with SVN 3591.

(The original source was not UTF8, so all messages which are tested have to be converted to UTF8 to be compared)
