### Description

There are several issues with this component, including:

need clear justification for use cases in which [http://www.php.net/parse\_url](http://www.php.net/parse_url) is not a better choice than using this component
==============================================================================================================================================================

e.g. use cases for URI's, not URL's
-----------------------------------

e.g. construction of URL's is not supported by parse\_url()
-----------------------------------------------------------

code require()'s bulky subclasses (even though they might never be used in the request)
=======================================================================================

Zend\_Uri should not be an abstract class:
==========================================

<http://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/>
-----------------------------------------

<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt> / <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zend\_Uri should work "out of the box" according to the RFCs above
------------------------------------------------------------------

Specialized handling of schemes should be provided by scheme-specific subclasses that are not require()'d to use Zend\_Uri.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A proposal is clearly needed. A rewrite might also be needed, but not before a proposal has been written that lists the purpose, use cases, etc. I am happy to help, just IM/email me anytime.

Waiving requirement for a proposal for Zend\_Uri. This class has been in Core for a long time, and it has matured plenty.
