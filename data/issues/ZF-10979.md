ZF-10979: Allow plugin resources to be registered automatically upon bootstrap request

### Description

At this moment Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract only allow to bootstrap plugin resources that are explicitly registered by calling registerPluginResource().

This requirement doesn't allow application bootstrap to load plugin resources by using plugin resources loader. It is specially uncomfortable in a case of some case of library that contains plugin resources.

For example: application bootstrap class have method \_initFoo() that depends on plugin resource Bar, which in its case depends on plugin resource Baz.

Currently, to get this scheme to work it is required to go by one of following ways: 1. Register both 'bar' and 'baz' into application bootstrap. It works, but requires application bootstrap to know about all _indirect_ dependencies of plugin resources. Means - Baz plugin is not directly required by application, but should be registered from application's bootstrap to allow Bar plugin to work. 2. Register 'baz' from Bar plugin resource. It also works but since Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::registerPluginResource() didn't check for duplicated registrations of same plugin it may cause different problem: in a case if plugin was registered by application bootstrap with passing some options - this registration will be overridden by plugin and custom options passed by application will be lost.

Proposed solution is to attempt to load plugin resource in getPluginResource() in a case if it is not registered.
