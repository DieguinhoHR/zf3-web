### Description

While trying to setup DisplayGroups in an xml configuration file (ordered by tag name) I discovered, that because I defined it above the elements-tag it wouldn't work. Would be nice if Zend\_Form could handle the options in an appropriate order.

XML-File:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    textElementName1Label 1
                        textElementName2Label 2
                        textElementName3Label 3
                        textElementName4Label 4
                        Form 1
                postElementName1ElementName2loginTest
                            Form 1
                        FieldsetFieldsetElementName1ElementName2loginTest
                            Form 1
                        textElementName1Label 1
                        textElementName2Label 2
                        textElementName3Label 3
                        textElementName4Label 4
                        Form 1
                post

Controller:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> $config = new Zend_Config_Xml(BASE_PATH . 'application/modules/ecrf/config/test.xml', 'sitearea', true);
            
    $form = new Zend_Form($config->test);
    $form2 = new Zend_Form($config->test2);
            
    $this->view->form = $form;
    $this->view->form2 = $form2;


If you look at the xml file you'll notice that and have the same options. works fine but doesn't work because of the different order. The error that occures starts with: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Form\_Exception' with message 'No valid elements specified for display group' in D:\\xampp\\htdocs\\projekte\\zend\\library\\Zend\\Form.php:1439 ...

Hope, you can now reproduce it. The snapshot used is ZendFramework-20080501-9348-en

Added a test to the suite showing to reproduce this (see r9380), but the test continued to pass. If you still experience the issue, please re-open, but be sure to paste in a fully reproducible case when doing so.
