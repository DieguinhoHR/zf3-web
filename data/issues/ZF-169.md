I would like to finish documenting it - fill out the blanks and maybe improve existing pieces. If you haven't started yet, assign it to me please

thanks

I can't assing to you mislav because your name is not on the list ! (maybe you don't have the dev status => see that point with Jayson).

But of course, I'm ok and I consider this task is for you.

Yet, if you need help, don't hesitate because the target is 0.1.5 (planned for July 6)
