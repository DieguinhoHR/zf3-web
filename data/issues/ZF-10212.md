ZF-10212: Missing Regions within array of valid regions.

### Description

Within the class Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Ec2\_Abstract there is a static array variable containing valid regions.

protected static $\_validEc2Regions = array('eu-west-1', 'us-east-1');

It currently only has 2 of the 4 regions available defined. I believe it should be (although perhaps there is a reason i missed for only having the two):

protected static $\_validEc2Regions = array('eu-west-1', 'us-east-1', 'us-west-1', 'ap-southeast-1');

Thanks Chris

On further investigation I see that this relates to the API version. Previous API versions only had the two regions.

Actually, this seems to work well without updating the API version, I guess Amazon accepts it just fine.

This would be nice to fix without going through a full update of the API, which will be quite an extensive work.

If needed, I can do it.

I've just edited this file to update the regions. Such a small change - are there other implications that are obstructing changing the code?
