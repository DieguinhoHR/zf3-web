ZF-10773: Format not set when using Date validator
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-12-03T05:46:11.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-02-14T14:58:12.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend\_Validate\_Date with Zend\_Locale taken form registry I get following validation error: "'something' does not fit the date format ''" where format is empty. It seems that $this->\_format is not set from $this->\_locale. Zend\_Date::isDate internally gets format from locale but outside in Zend\_Validate\_Date::isValid it is not known.

Which locale is being used? Which date is used? Which parameters are set within validate\_date?

My Date validator does not have any additional parameters and is set-up like this 'validators' => array( array('Date'), ) Locale is set through application.ini: resources.locale.default = "en" resources.locale.force = true When I enter any text into date field (with attached jquery Datepicker) I got message: 'foo' does not fit the date format ''

I believe the Date validator should get the date format from locale which is set-up and display it correctly to the user...

I can confirm this bug.

Same happens here... ZF 1.11.11. Setting Zend\_Locale in the registry prevents Zend\_Validate\_Date from working with the following error message: "'2011-01-01' does not fit the date format '' " (with empty format).
