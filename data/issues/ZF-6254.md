### Description

Currently the Http client for the audioscrobbler service is set hardcoded inside the constructor.

A testing mode is included to be able to unit-test the audioscrobbler service, because through the hard dependency the Mock Client cannot be used.

This can easily be solved by introducing a setHttpClient function on the audioscrobbler service.
