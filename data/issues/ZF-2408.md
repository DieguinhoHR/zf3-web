ZF-2408: \_redirect() method not working with 'exit' option set to false
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_redirect() never redirects when 'exit' option is set to false.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_redirect($myUri, array('exit' => false));


As I understand it should redirect the client but keep the script working.

Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector::gotoUrl() method never sends headers when getExit() returns false.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function gotoUrl($url, array $options = array())
    {
        $this->setGotoUrl($url, $options);
    
        if ($this->getExit()) {
            $this->redirectAndExit();
        }
    }


...and the fix is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function gotoUrl($url, array $options = array())
    {
        $this->setGotoUrl($url, $options);
    
        if ($this->getExit()) {
            $this->redirectAndExit();
        } else {
            $this->getResponse()->sendHeaders();
        }
    }

The headers are not supposed to be sent via the Redirector; they are instead set in the response object, and, if $exit is false, sent when the response is rendered (the response sends headers as well as output).

Unless you can provide an example the clearly displays that the redirect does not happen in such a situation, I will close this issue.

I've created the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        public function fooAction()
        {
        }
    
        public function redirectAction()
        {
            $this->_redirect('/test/foo', array('exit' => false));
        }
    }


along with relevant view scripts. I can verify that calling /test/redirect _does_ in fact redirect, contrary to the report.

Piotr, is it OK to close this bug? Are you still seeing this issue?
