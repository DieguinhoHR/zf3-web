Hi,

Are you encountering some troubles which can be reproduced? Or is this a best-practice suggestion?

Thanks, Shahar.

No I haven't troubles. I have found it by chance.

To uncompress deflated data the function gzinflate must use. (php.net: gzinflate â€” Inflate a deflated string) To uncompress data compressed by gzcompress the function gzuncompress (php.net: Uncompress a compressed string)

Or does I doing wrong ?

Well, since the compression support in Zend\_Http\_Client went through allot of testing and is being used in production, I am going to hold this off in lower priority. I will review if this is somehow problematic when the time is right, but for now, since it is working, I don't see any point in fixing it.

Shahar.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

I am not sure why, but this seems to be the correct way to reverse both compression algorithms. I am closing this for now as it does work and I couldn't get it to work just by using the functions you suggest.

If you encounter any problems or have a working patch which is somehow better, please reopen this bug.

I did encounter and issue using windows live contacts api. The results is returned with encoding "deflate" and using gzuncompress returns false while gzinflate decompresses it correctly.
