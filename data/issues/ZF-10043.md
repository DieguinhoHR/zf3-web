### Description

Currently a Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route of the following pattern does not work as expected with Zend\_Navigation View Helpers.

"/domain/:domain/:controller/:action/\*"

When specifying any pages under a domain for Zend\_Navigation an Exception is generated saying its missing the "domain" parameter, where as Zend\_Navigation should be doing a "getParam" for the missing parameter before it throws the exception since it is changing value which cannot be hard coded. There should also be some sort of method to register a callback or replacement Name/Title based on the return value of the "getParam" call. That way when I specify an integer in the domain field I can register what I want to display in the integers place in the Breadcrumbs/Menu.

This is still an issue, in that an exception is thrown when a dynamic route is used. The exception always follows the form mentioned, "_variable name_ is not specified".

You can rectify this by adding a default value for the variable, though I don't really understand why. It is certainly not required when using routes independent of zend\_navigation.
