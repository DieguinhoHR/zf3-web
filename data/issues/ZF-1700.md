### Description

We can't unset a variable with Zend\_Config.

I write this patch for Zend/Config.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __unset($name)
    {
        if ($this->_allowModifications) {
           unset($this->_data[$name]);
        }
    }

I'll defer to [~rob] for further comment, but I am curious as to why you would want to unset configuration data. I have not needed to unset application configuration data before, but maybe some use-case context would illuminate the reasoning?

We write a save method for Zend\_Config\_Ini. We use it to update our config file in upgrade of our application. In last version we need to remove a field into the config that's why we use unset.

Fix version after 1.0.1.

I'm struggling to see the benefit of unset too. Given that you'd have to write all the saving functionality, I'd have thought that was the place to put unset() too?

When we read this file with Zend\_Config\_Ini:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [general]
    tutu="test"
    tata.toto="test"


tutu is an instance of Zend\_Config\_Ini but tata.toto is an instance of Zend\_Config and we can't change this.

Unset could be useful. Think of situations where you want to iterate over a set but remove a few items before you do.

Not only do i see use in this method being implemented, but it rounds out the family of magic functions.

Fixed on trunk in revision 6362.

Darby, do you want me to put this onto the release-1.0 branch?

Yes, please do. I've reviewed the changes and they look good to me. :)
