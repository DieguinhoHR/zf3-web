### Description

Cannot match Zend\_Autoloader\_Resource namespaces with Zend\_Amf\_Server

$loader = new Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource(array( 'basePath' => APPLICATION\_PATH, 'namespace' => '', )); $loader->addResourceType('service', '/services', 'Service\_'); $loader->addResourceType('dto', '/dtos', 'Dto\_'); $loader->setDefaultResourceType('service');

$server = new Zend\_Amf\_Server(); $server->setProduction(false); $server->addDirectory(APPLICATION\_PATH .'/services');

'Service\_' namespace set up to map to the /services directory.

class Service\_Amf\_Files maps to APPLICATION\_PATH/services/Amf/Files.php

When a remote AMF call comes in to Service\_Amf\_Files, Zend\_Amf\_Server is looking for /services/Service/Amf/Files . This is because the Amf\_Server thinks (correctly) that all it's files are in the /services directory, but it doesn't know anything about the Autoloader\_Resource and goes ahead with the class naming conventions as if a 'Service' directory actually exists.

From The Framework mailing list: [http://nabble.com/Zend\_Autoloader\_Resource-and-Zenâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Autoloader_Resource-and-Zend_Amf_Server-Not-Playing-Nice-td23381910.html)

"Using Zend\_Autoloader\_Resource is working great. Except for one thing: matching

> the namespaces up with Zend\_Amf\_Server

If you haven't already, please add an issue to the tracker for this; most likely, it's the autodiscovery code in Zend\_Amf\_Server that needs to be slightly modified to allow for autoloading.

Thanks!
