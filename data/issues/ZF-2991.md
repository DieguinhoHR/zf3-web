### Description

When using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Oracle with Zend\_Db\_Select the table name should come in uppercase when quoted.

eg.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $db = new Zend_Db_Adapter_Oracle();
    $select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);
    $select->from('table');


should turn out to be

 
    <pre class="literal">
    SELECT * FROM "TABLE"


but not

 
    <pre class="literal">
    SELECT * FROM "table"


Because when quoting the table name in lowercase the database will retrun

 
    <pre class="literal">
    ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

Not for me... this is probably only related to Oracle.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

This is all wrong .. I found out the hard way that a table name and column names CAN be in lowercase in Oracle. So this issue can be deleted, because user (programmer) has to write the correct table name. :D

Sorry for the inconvenient.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
