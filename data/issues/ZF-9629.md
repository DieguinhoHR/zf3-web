### Description

The following code snippet returns the actual date, instead of the date set in the constructor.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/TimeSync.php';
    
    $serverlist = array(
    '<a>ntp://ntp.ubuntu.com</a>',
    );
    
    $server = new Zend_TimeSync($serverlist);
    $servers = $server->getIterator();
    
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array('timesync' => $servers[0]));
    $date = new Zend_Date("2001-01-01","YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
    echo $date;


the problems seems to be a line 174 - 180 of Zend\_Date (version $Id: Date.php 21282 2010-03-01 21:40:19Z thomas $):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($date instanceof Zend_TimeSync_Protocol) {
           $date = $date->getInfo();
           $date = $this->_getTime($date['offset']);
           $part = null;
    } else if (parent::$_defaultOffset != 0 ) {
           $date = $this->_getTime(parent::$_defaultOffset);
    }


as soon as "parent::$\_defaultOffset" is set, dates passed to the constructor are ignored, and the timestamp is used.

I think that you misunderstood what time synchronisation should do.

Using timesync you say that Zend\_Date MUST return the actual date. Regardless of any given input.

There is, and there must be no way to change the time and date which is returned by the timeserver.

When you need to change the result which is returned by the timeserver then you must do this after object creation.

The default offset is set by Zend\_TimeSync... there are just two ways how time synchronisation can be used. Directly or by using the option timesync. But from handling they are both more or less equal.
