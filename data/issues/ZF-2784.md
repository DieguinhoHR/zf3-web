### Description

Hello,

I've posted about this to mailing list, but nobody fixed it, so:

I'm currently working on Czech translation of the manual and I came across a thing, which can be written in a better-explaining way.

It is just a tiny bit in Zend\_Json-Objects.xml on line 29

instead of: // Decode objects as objects

can be: // Decode JSON objects as PHP objects

I know, it is not so important, but why not to make the manual even better :)

Reggards

Martin H.

Yes, I ensure it in [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.json.objects.html)
