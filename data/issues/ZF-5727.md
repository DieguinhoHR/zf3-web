ZF-5727: Wrong empty login fields handle.

### Description

The user name and the password shouldn't belong to the \_authenticateSetup because when the user doesn't fill the user name and the password out, the application terminates with Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Exception and we cannot test why is this terminated unless we parse the message of the exception. We have $this->\_authenticateResultInfo below the exception but it never runs with empty user input.

We suggest the following: comment these lines out to not throw exception, so the application can go with empty user name and password and another const in the Zend\_Auth\_Result and fill out from the \_authenticateSetup() so we can test easily.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable (line 307)
     */
    if ($this->_tableName == '') {
        $exception = 'A table must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    } elseif ($this->_identityColumn == '') {
        $exception = 'An identity column must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    } elseif ($this->_credentialColumn == '') {
        $exception = 'A credential column must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    } elseif ($this->_identity == '') {
        $exception = 'A value for the identity was not provided prior to authentication with Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable.';
    } elseif ($this->_credential === null) {
        $exception = 'A credential value was not provided prior to authentication with Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable.';
    }
    
    // change to:
    if ($this->_tableName == '') {
        $exception = 'A table must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    } elseif ($this->_identityColumn == '') {
        $exception = 'An identity column must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    } elseif ($this->_credentialColumn == '') {
        $exception = 'A credential column must be supplied for the Zend_Auth_Adapter_DbTable authentication adapter.';
    }

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable requires that at least an identity and a credential be supplied as arguments before authenticate() time. Typically, it would be the job of your Form, Controller or Model to ensure that this proper validation of provided information has been provided, and prompt the user that it has not before calling authenticate(). It would be bad practice to allow authenticate() to run on non-existent identity and credentials.
