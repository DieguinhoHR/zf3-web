ZF-7037: Issuing SoapServer Faults through Zend\_Soap\_Server.

### Description

I kept finding the need to conditionally issue SoapServer faults outside of the scope of classes or functions being handled by SoapServer.

To issue a SoapServer fault, you merely need to call SoapServer::fault($code, $message, ...), but from what I can deduce, Zend\_Soap\_Server has no public method to retrieve the instance of SoapServer it is using.

One fix is to make Zend\_Soap\_Server::\_getSoap() a public method. Alternatively, I chose to add an $issueFault flag to Zend\_Soap\_Server::fault(). By default, it will not issue a SoapServer fault, but if set to true, a fault will be issued with the message and code provided.

I have supplied the diff.

Please let me know if I'm off base in my attempt or am missing some simple way to externally issue a SoapServer fault through Zend\_Soap\_Server.
