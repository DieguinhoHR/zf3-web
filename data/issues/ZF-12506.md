### Description

Well, I'm actually requesting to revert ZF-11992.

Since the new year is just starting we have had some complaints that (when using weeknumber / year calculations derived from single dates) all of a sudden, instead of ex. week 1 and 2 of 2013 we get a range from week 1, 2012 up to and including week 2, 2013.

Please reopen the original issue and do not create a new one.

Ok, no problem; but how? I cannot find anything to reopen or otherwise point in that direction.
