### Description

When chaining routes together.. (ie. a hostname and a path route)... If a variable is used in the hostname, it should not be reused inside the path route...

For example.. if you were matching this hostname route:

:user.example.com

and this path is chained in:

:controller/:action/\*

then when you pass in array(user=>'someone')

you will get this back:

[http://someone.example.com/index/index/â€¦](http://someone.example.com/index/index/user/someone/)

It appears this is a bug... in the assemble function of the Hostname router...

On line 249, it attempts to unset the element from the data array, but because $data was not passed by reference it doesn't affect future chained routes.

Is there a convention I'm missing to force the chained routes to not use previously matched variables?

Assigning to Ben for triage.

Hm, I'm pretty sure that I already wrote a unit tested fix for that. Will look into it the next days.

Unless additional information or a specific example is provided, I recommend closing as "Not an issue".
