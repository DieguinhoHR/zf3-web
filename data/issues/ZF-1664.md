### Description

I have noticed a bug that was not present in version 1.0.0 RC1. This is the code I use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $overduesDb = Zend_Registry::get('overduesDb'); // loads the db connection
    $select = $overduesDb->select();
            
    $select->from(array('n'=>'notes'), 'n.*');
    $select->join(array('o'=>'overduesNotes'), 'n.id = o.noteId', array());
    $select->where('o.invoiceId = ?', $this->_invoiceId);
            
    if ($type != null) $select->where('n.type = ?', $type);
    $select->order('messageDate DESC');


when I print out the query it creates with "$select->\_\_toString()", I obtain:

with version 1.0.0 RC1:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "n".* FROM "notes" AS "n" INNER JOIN "overduesNotes" AS "o" ON n.id = o.noteId 
    WHERE (o.invoiceId = '041990') ORDER BY "messageDate" DESC


with version 1.0.0:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "n".* FROM "notes" AS "n" INNER JOIN "overduesNotes" AS "o" ON n.id = o.noteId 
    WHERE (o.invoiceId = 041990) ORDER BY "messageDate" DESC


As you can see, the string 041990 is not quoted anymore in the last release, and this ends giving an error upon fetching the results, as it tries to convert the varchar value to a column of data type int.

Is this normal? Am I using the method correctly or is it suppose to _escape_ quotes only? I am asking because the behaviour of this method has changed from version 1.0.0 RC1 to version 1.0.0.

Thank you for your cooperation, Loris Candylaftis

I apologize for this regression failure.

I had to change this behavior of the \_quote() methods because they broke under Oracle and DB2 when numeric values were quoted and then compared to numeric columns or expressions. That is, the following makes Oracle and DB2 unhappy:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    WHERE integerColumn = '1234'


So the change allows strings containing digits to remain unquoted. The reason this change was necessary is that Oracle and DB2 return numeric values as strings of digit characters, and then Zend\_Db\_Table uses the quote() method when constructing WHERE clauses. I had previously used is\_int($value) || is\_float($value) in the \_quote() method, but this didn't work for Oracle and DB2.

You are use a string of digits that passes the is\_numeric() test yet it must be interpreted as a string. Let's try to identify a temporary workaround and we'll figure out a better solution for ZF 1.0.1:

Edit or extend the Zend\_Db\_Adapter class(es) you use, and revert the logic in the \_quote() method. Change this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (is_numeric($value)) {


to this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (is_int($value) || is_float($value)) {

Fix committed in the trunk in revision 5800.

All unit tests pass, including those for Oracle and DB2, which are intolerant of comparing strings to int columns.

I have changed the solution and implemented it in revision 5845.
