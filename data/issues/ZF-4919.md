ZF-4919: NotEmpty works incorrect when validating data starting with space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Validator does tell that data is empty; but string contains characters. Think validator should pass data beginning with space as valid.

Can not verify issue. Please give an example...

False is returned on: \* String = '' \* String containing only whitespaces \* Non-String when empty returns false (f.e. integer 0 or array () )

No failure found.

When there is no response until 18.12. I will close this issue as no issue.
