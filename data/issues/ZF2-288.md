### Description

We often develop on domains like <http://local.www.example.com>, where <http://www.example.com> is our production URL. It would be nice to match that where the local part is optional (route: :environment.<www.example.com>).

Another use case is our staging environment. We use Akamai to make wildcard subdomains all go to staging environment. So we will have urls like <http://some-branch.stage.www.example.com> or <http://another-branch.stage.www.example.com>. It would be nice to optionally match against a route like :branch.:environment.<www.example.com>
