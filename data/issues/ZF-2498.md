ZF-2498: Zend\_OpenID doesn't play nice with Zend\_Controller (due to rewrites)

### Description

When implementing Zend\_OpenID inside a controller Zend\_OpenID::selfUrl() is always going to return the front controller 'index.php' but in reality it is being routed from <http://example.com/controller/action>

It seems like it should be possible to just cache the return\_to url that I send during Consumer::login() and check it against the one received in Consumer::verify(). As long as the return to URL matches what I expect, it's really not important that it matches the current URL. Doing so just makes it painful to work with controllers and rewrites.

I'm kind of curious is there any reason this check could not be dropped completely. I don't see any obvious reason why it needs to be there and it complicates things a bit for mod\_rewrite users.

Heres an option:

In JanRain's implementation you actually pass the return\_to URL to the complete() function.

$response = $this->consumer->complete($return\_to);

Sorry, but I'm not able to reproduce the issue. The demo MVC application "demo/Zend/OpenId/mvc\_auth" works fine. The bug is probably already fixed some time ago (svn diff -r 6835:7023 library/Zend/OpenId.php).

Hmm... I wasn't working out of SVN. I believe I downloaded a nightly, but perhaps not. I'll check it out via svn and give it another go. Sorry.

Dmity,

The issue is that on a CGI/FastCGI setup (I'm using lighttpd myself) the variables that are being used to evaluate selfUrl don't give you what you need.

For example, when I load a URL such as <http://localhost/testmod/testcontrol/testaction> and add a phpinfo() in there to check variables, this is what I see:

$\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_URI'] is not set $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'] is set to localhost $\_SERVER['SERVER\_PORT'] is set to 80 $\_SERVER['SERVER\_NAME'] is set to localhost $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_URL'] is not set $\_SERVER['REDIRECT\_URL'] is not set $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF'] is set to /index.php $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is set to /index.php $\_SERVER['PATH\_INFO'] has no value

The only variable that has the correct value for use in selfUrl (on my server) is $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI']. But, I'm wondering, why you don't use functionality such as is found in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http to do this work for you? Why make this evaluation in two different ways?

Must be fixed now. Could you please verify it?

Yep, it works! Don't know if you need Steven to verify that it works for him as well, but the update did get things working for me. Thanks Dmitry!
