Resolved as duplicating [ZF-1157].

This issue is not a duplicate. The SVN patch applied on the other issue did not include the fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $acl->isAllowed('someUser', 'someResource') ? 'allowed' : 'denied';

Oops! I beg your pardon, and will commit a fix shortly.

Thanks, Gavin! :)

No problems, we all have typos in our docs, and I know how much I appreciate having more eyes helping with docs I wrote :)
