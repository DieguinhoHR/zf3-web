### Description

I'm working with a XML config file like this one:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    user1@company.comUser Name

using this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?$cc = $config->mailler->cc->receiver->toArray()?>


$cc is not really what I expected it to be:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    array
      'receiver' => 
        array
          'mail' => string 'user1@company.com' (length=17)
          'name' => string 'User Name' (length=9)
          0 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'nice.guy@company.com' (length=20)
              'name' => string 'Nice Guy' (length=8)
          1 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'fred@company.com' (length=16)


I though I would get something like that:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    array
      'receiver' => 
        array
          0 =>
            array
              'mail' => string 'user1@company.com' (length=17)
              'name' => string 'User Name' (length=9)
          1 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'nice.guy@company.com' (length=20)
              'name' => string 'Nice Guy' (length=8)
          2 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'fred@company.com' (length=16)


When I think of this, I can't see why it doesn't work as one can expect it.

might it be a bug?

In fact that looks like a bug in the \_processExtends() method.

I think that this is expected behaviour as per the current parsing rules.

In you are specifying as an object with two properties. You then create an array of s in , but as $receiver->mail already exists, the best it can do is create an array for you as it doesn't convert the previously created receiver object into an array.

Now, we could change it so that it does convert the in into an array before merging the in . If we did that though, then as extends , the resultant array would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array
      'receiver' => 
        array
          0 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'nice.guy@company.com' (length=20)
              'name' => string 'Nice Guy' (length=8)
          1 => 
            array
              'mail' => string 'fred@company.com' (length=16)


as would completely override . Your expected result would never happen as that's a merge, not an override.

Thoughts?

in fact, thinking about it, <?$cc = $config->mailler->cc->toArray()?> might have the behaviour I wanted, according to that other non-bug (ZF-5973) I reported.

Try it, but I suspect that you'll have the same issue.
