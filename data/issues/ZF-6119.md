ZF-6119: Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page improvement for cache\_with\_cookie\_variables and sessions

### Description

Using sessions in an application may have a possibly undesired effect on Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page:

When trying to cache a page via the Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page frontend, and with options cache\_with\_session\_variables = true and cache\_with\_post\_variables = false, then no cache-id will be generated. Reason for this is that the session generates a volatile cookie with a predefined session name. Even if no other data is set in the cookies, then no cache-id is generated. This is expected behaviour, but it may be undesired. After all, if you refrain from using cookies, then you should be able to generate a cache-id.

An improvement should be built into Zend\_Cache\_Frontend\_Page::\_makePartialId(). If cache\_with\_session\_variables is true, then the session name ("PHPSESSID" per default) index should not be taken into account when trying to create a partial Id for the $\_COOKIES superglobal.

I'd go one step further and say that the namespace meta data (SESSION['\_ZF') etc. should also not be taken into account. This too is data that the innocent developer may not be aware of as present in the SESSION array and including it can cause the ID to change for every page.

The problem becomes even more lethal when combined with the various approaches found on the Web to implement an inactivity timeout. All invariably involve setting a "last Activity time" into the session on each request. (Either directly, or indirectly through rememberMe which calls regenerateID, etc.). Each page will cause the serialized version of the SESSION to change, causing a new key, causing a cache miss. All suggested solutions fail for this scenario (meaning they effectively negate the page cache if, for other reasons, the key must depend on the SESSION content).

Another approach involves subclassing Zend\_Cache\_FrontEnd\_Page to generate ids differently, but unfortunately, makeID (called in start), is private, forcing you to completely override start (which is not private), which seems rather inefficient and undesirable.

Pardon in the above comment, the remark about the visibility of makeId pertains to 1.6.x versions.
