Assigning to Martel. My understanding is that this type of route is not allowed on the standard route as it only supports one variable per path segment; you may want to check out the new regex route for this type of thing.

Martel will surely chime in and let us know what he things as well.

Matthew, you have explained it fully so there is no sense to say the same in another words, I guess :)

If you wish to use regex route, then you could probably use something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    new ... Route_Regex(
       "images/products/(\d+)_(\d+)_(\d+).jpg",
       array('controller' => ...),
       array(1 => 'id', 2 => 'width', 3 => 'height')
    );


And you can of course create your own route implementation.
