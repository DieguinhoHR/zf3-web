### Description

Locale files in resources/languages/ are old, and not corresponding to the present messages. I found this problem only in EmailAddress validation, but there can be other problems.

Every translation team is responsible for translating the resource files for its native language. There are unittests which show non translated messages and my requests to fix those are more or less ignored by the teams.

We provide actually 15 different languages and I speak only 2 of them. :-)

Feel free to open an issue for a specific language when you can also provide the related translation. We will be happy on any help regarding translation of resources.

Therefor closing this issue as won't fix and waiting for detailed informations.

Sorry for my insufficient report.

The problem is not in translations, but in English message. Therefore, there is no need for knowledge about each languages, just copy-and-paste work.

For example,

// from r24305 /trunk/library/Zend/Validate/EmailAddress.php self::INVALID\_FORMAT => "'%value%' is no valid email address in the basic format local-part@hostname",

// from r23772 /trunk/resources/languages/ja/Zend\_Validate.php "'%value%' is not a valid email address in the basic format local-part@hostname" => "'%value%' はメールアドレスの基本的な形式 local-part@hostname ではありません",

Here, "no valid email" and "not a valid email" are different, so this translation file is correct in translated messages, but does not work.

In different languages the change of two words can lead to a different translation. Therefor such changes must be reviewed and implemented by the related translation team.
