### Description

Apparently, there is no way to get the currently set controller directory from the Front and Dispatcher classes. This is badly required to alter the controller directory at runtime by appending to the currently set value retrieved by invoking getControllerDirectory().

These were added as part of the MVC rewrite, and are in the MVC implementation in the 0.2 incubator and current svn.
