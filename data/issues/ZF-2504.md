ZF-2504: Unused variable - possibly wrong assignment?
-----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-01-26T18:57:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-28T13:44:28.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File::\_path($id) - line 617.

 
    <pre class="highlight">// we store tags in the same directory than the father
    $id2 = $this->_tagCacheIdToFatherCacheId($id);

Anyway, the $id2 variable is declared to the same value as $hash on the next line, but is unused after this. Possibly the dev planned on doing something with it?

Also, while you're in this section of the code: the comment is confusing - reads like contamination to me. It's either 'the same directory as', or 'a different directory than'.

the file backend is completly new in trunk (SVN)

IMHO, it fixes this issue

please have a look at it and reopen this issue if there is still a problem
