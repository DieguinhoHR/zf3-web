### Description

_Zend\_Http\_Response_ could implement \*\_\_toString()\* magic method to take advantage of using in string context eg.:

 
    <pre class="highlight">



    <?php echo $response; ?>


This would simply proxy to asString().

Shahar, please work with Matthew on what to do with this one. Sounds reasonable, but I want to make sure that the use case is sound. Thanks.
