ZF-1508: Implement CROSS JOIN functionality for DB2
---------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2007-06-06T21:01:56.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-08-31T09:11:51.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

DB2 does not support the CROSS JOIN syntax:

SELECT "zfproducts".\*, "zfbugs\_products".\* FROM "zfproducts" CROSS JOIN "zfbugs\_products"

but this query should produce the equivalent result:

SELECT \* FROM "zfproducts", "zfbug\_products"

To implement this, there should probably be a Zend\_Db\_Select\_Db2 class that inherits from Zend\_Db\_Select.

We need to investigate whether this runs afoul of the same SQL semantics that have plagued MySQL 5.0.12. SQL-99 defined an order of precedence for comma-style and JOIN-style joins that causes some grief:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT *
    FROM TableA AS a, 
      TableB AS b JOIN TableC AS c ON a.foo = c.bar


In the above example, SQL-99 says that JOIN should be evaluated before the comma-join, despite the comma appearing first. So the correlation name for a.foo doesn't exist at this time, and the SQL parser gives up. I don't know whether IBM DB2 implements the SQL-99 semantics, or if it will do so in the future.

The correct solution is to avoid mixing comma-style (aka SQL-89) and JOIN-style (aka SQL-92), and only use one or the other consistently in a given query. That's why CROSS JOIN was defined in SQL-92, so there is a non-comma syntax to perform that type of join.

In any case, it's probably not a high priority to provide CROSS JOIN support, since few people even know about this syntax. So I'm marking this issue Postponed for now.

Also, a possible workaround is to use INNER JOIN with a condition that is always true, resulting in the same query result as a CROSS JOIN:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT *
    FROM TableA AS a INNER JOIN TableB AS b ON 1 = 1

Another possibility for extending Zend\_Db\_Select is that Zend\_Db\_Select\_Db2 implements joinCross() as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function joinCross($name, $cols = '*', $schema = null)
    {
        return $this->_join(self::INNER_JOIN, $name, '(1 = 1)', $cols, $schema);
    }

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
