ZF-5684: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract doesn't honor Zend\_Db\_Adapter fetch mode
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I need Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract in combination with Zend\_Db::FETCH\_OBJ but Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_fetch() has hardcoded to use Zend\_Db::FETCH\_ASSOC and furthermore Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract isnt't ready to have anything but an assoc as value for $this->\_data.
