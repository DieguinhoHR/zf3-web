ZF-5783: Undefined offset in Zend\_Gdata\_GdataOnlineTest::testFeedImplementation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Unit Tests: Problem Created: 2009-02-13T16:49:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-02-26T16:09:11.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.7.6 (02/Mar/09)

### Description

When running Zend\_Gdata\_GdataOnlineTest, the following unit test failure occurs:

 
    <pre class="literal">testFeedImplementation(Zend_Gdata_GdataOnlineTest)
    Undefined offset:  3
    .../library/Zend/Gdata/App/Feed.php:153
    .../library/Zend/Gdata/App/Feed.php:153

This is caused because testFeedImplementation() isn't calling rewind() before calling current(), and the changes made for protocol v2 support added a foreach() statement (which calls rewind() at the start of execution, not after).

The fix is to call rewind() inside of testFeedImplementation().

Assigning to [~jhartmann], since he already has code to fix this. :)
