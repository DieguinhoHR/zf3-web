### Description

The Zend\_Mail methods from(), addTo() and addCc() take a name to be displayed as second Parameter. This parameter could corrupt the mail headers if it contains comma. Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->setFrom('administrator@example.org');
    $mail->addTo('doe@example.org', 'Doe, John');
    $mail->send();


Now the mail would be send to 'doe@example.org' as well as 'doe@srv1.domain.local'. If UTF-8 and Umlaute are involved the whole thing would pile up to something along '=?utf-8?Q?d=C3=B6e@srv1.domain.local'

A work around would be to pass 'Doe%2C John'.

Back then i just used a urlencode() around my parameter. Is this the same quoting as described in the RFC for the [Internet Message Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.2.3), or do we have to implement something else?

Is this still an issue? I wasn't able to reproduce the result you describe when including a comma in the second argument of setFrom or add\* methods. This is the test that I used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @group ZF-10792
     */
    public function testCommaInRecipientNameIsEncodedProperly()
    {
        $mail = new Zend_Mail();
        $mail->setFrom('test@test.com', 'Test, Test');
        $mail->addTo('adam@lundrigan.ca', 'Doe, John');
        $mail->setBodyText('foo');
        $mail->send();
    }


The email was delivered to my mail server with the correct recipients and display names intact.

I have to add that this bug only occured on linux servers wich mail() to a local sendmail before it goes to the "Exchange", MS Exchange in that case. Maybe that is part of the problem, i'll try it out tomorrow.

Well without umlauts this works as expected!

Zend\_Mail::getHeader() reports:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    However with umlauts, when i take "Döe, John" as name, Zend_Mail::getHeader() reports:


Sending it from Windows to our SMTP works fine. Header unchanged.

When the nullmailer in Ubuntu handles this, the header in the Outlook Message Options reads like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    So nullmailer thinks it got 2 adresses here, i don't know.
    * Is the display name supposed to be not "quoted" when it is UTF-8?
    * Isn't the comma a special character to seperate adresses and therefor needed to be escaped by any means?
    
    If i pass "Döe%2C John" it works just fine again:


But now the space has changed to =20 by nullmailer!?

My advice is to ditch nullmailer and use SMTP directly from Zend\_Mail. Thats is the cool thing about this component. If anyone could figure out the RFC and tell us when and how to escape stuff it would be even better.

I think i found where it should be encoded. This patch will add the comma to Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable(), i also added two assertions in Zend\_MailTest.

Fixed in svn r24953.

Causes failures on Windows "Zend\_MimeTest::testEncodeMailHeaderQuotedPrintable with data set #3"

There are commas in data for test, but they are not encoded in expected data. Shouldn't they be also encoced?
