re: "Shouldn't return type be Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite instead of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface" -- No. While Router\_Rewrite is the default router shipped with ZF, you can attach different router classes that implement Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Interface; in fact, Router\_Rewrite is itself an implementation of it.

The second point is valid, however.

Zend\_Controller\_Front line 511 its correct so because the base class is \_interface The double documented thing will be fixed
