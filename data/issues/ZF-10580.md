### Description

This is relatively minor thing, but it breaks the coding standards where code can be run with E\_NOTICE turned on.

I'm going through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/â€¦](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_user_agents_for_mobile_phones) and seeing how the mobile detection works for WURFL for the various user agents. It didn't detect mine very well (it found that my Samsung Epic was a generic Android, even though there is a match for the user agent in the XML file). But I get an E\_NOTICE when I tried one of the other user agents.

Mozilla/5.0 (webOS/1.4.0; U; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/1.0 Safari/532.2 Pre/1.0

Notice: Undefined offset: 3 in D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework-1.11.0b1\\library\\Zend\\Http\\UserAgent\\AbstractDevice.php on line 570

And when I tried

Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; en-us; SPH-D700 Build/ECLAIR) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17

I got

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\workspace\\Test\\library\\Wurfl\\CapabilitiesHolder.php on line 67

Hi,

The first E\_NOTICE is now fixed but the second one is not reproductible.

Note that the notice message is coming from the Wurfl Api and not Zend\_Http\_UserAgent : you have maybe to verify the config of Wurfl Api in C:\\workspace\\Test\\library\\Wurfl

It seems to be an issue with detecting Android-based phones. I don't think I've been able to detect any of the Android phones I've tried. I will attach a test script.

This tests with several user agents for different types of phones. The Android-based phones will not be caught.

It's strange

In attachment the var\_dump of features identified with the second user agent mentionned : Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; en-us; SPH-D700 Build/ECLAIR) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17

I think there is maybe an issue with "$device->getBrowser()" => I will study this point

getBrowser method fixed : the value of "browser\_name" provided by Wurfl is now used instead of the value extracted from UserAgent chain

I've merged the changes from Raphael to the 1.11 release branch, and they'll be incorporated in the 1.11 final release.

Still not fixed in released ZF 1.11.0 Trying with Firefox 4 beta 6 I got the same " PHP Notice: Undefined offset: 3 in /usr/local/PEAR/Zend/Http/UserAgent/AbstractDevice.php on line 651"

\*\* if you try with latest wurfl xml file, this notice is not showing. But i presume using some exotic user agent will trigger it again.

The notice in AbstractDevice.php on line 651 still appears in ZF 1.11.3 (to reproduce, use Firefox 4 Beta 11) Here is the code in question:

if (isset($comment[4])) { $result['browser\_build'] = trim($comment[4]); } $result['browser\_language'] = trim($comment[3]); // <-- this line creates the notice

Adding an if to check if $comment[3] is set (just like the one for $comment[4]) should fix the problem, I think.

ZF-10580-a.patch Added the patch for fixing the issue with " PHP Notice: Undefined offset: 3 in /usr/local/PEAR/Zend/Http/UserAgent/AbstractDevice.php on line 651"

This problem also exists in zend 1.11.5 and can be resolved by using the patch above.

Can anybody test current trunk for me? I think I may have resolved these issues with ZF-11557.

I remember already got this error in two situations:

1 - At work, using firefox 3.6 in Linux behind a proxy.

2 - At home, using firefox 6 in Windows with no proxy (this one i'm getting right now).

The original issue has been resolved. Please open a new ticket if you encounter new issues with UA detection.
