### Description

@ hides error message and make it ignored by PHP's error\_log mechanism.

Details: PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 16777216 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 275863 bytes) in lib/Zend/Pdf/Filter/Compression/Flate.php on line 52 It's not being displayed nor logged using standard PHP error\_log mechanism, it is just silent fail hard to debug. I get this error on php.ini "memory\_limit = 16M" (debian's default) so this error can occur quite often. @ should not be used when function can generate fatal err, and if case of gzcompress() it can happen often.
