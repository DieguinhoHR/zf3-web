### Description

Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap->connect() throws an exception this way is fsockopen fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $this->_socket = @fsockopen($host, $port, $errno, $errstr, self::TIMEOUT_CONNECTION);
            if (!$this->_socket) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception('cannot connect to host : ' . $errno . ' : ' . $errstr);
            }


So for example, in case of a timeout, the exception has the following message:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    cannot connect to host : 110 : Connection timed out


When I got this trying to connect to an IMAP server, I figured the Zend-based software was trying to connect via POP3, which uses port 110, and that for some reason the error missed the hostname but only showed the port. I realized in the end that 110 wasn't a port but an errno. It is not entirely wrong though to expect a hostname after "host :". I would suggest this form instead:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'Cannot connect to host. connect(): error ' . $errno . ' (' . $errstr . ')'
