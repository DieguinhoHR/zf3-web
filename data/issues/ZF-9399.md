### Description

For debugging reasons in a production environment, I am reporting all serious exceptions (that produce a HTTP 500 error in my ErrorController) by email to the application responsible (me). I'd like to get the whole Exception output like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _reportException($e)
        {
            // Get exception output and enforce cli SAPI for text only output
            Zend_Debug::setSapi('cli');
    
            $debugOutput = Zend_Debug::dump($e, null, false);
            ...


in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception's the password of the connection gets exposed. Is there a way to obfuscate this or could you enhance Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception to obfuscate passwords by default? (e.g. by adding an extra method setObfuscateMode($bool), if you wish to turn it off) Please tell me, if it's already implemented in a different way. thanks, Philip
