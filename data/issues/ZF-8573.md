ZF-8573: FlashMessenger and Redirector
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-12-17T14:39:23.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:12.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When I use redirection: $this->\_redirect($url); or $this->getHelper('redirector')->gotoUrl($url); or $this->getResponse()->setRedirect($this->\_helper->url->url($parameters,$route))->sendResponse();

FlashMessenger works fine, but: $this->getHelper('redirector')->gotoRoute($parameters,$route);

An array with messages from FlasMessenger is empty.
