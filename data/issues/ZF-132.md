### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/manual>

On this page, the table at the top that contains the "Programmer's Reference Guide" part is enclosed in a table that has it's width restricted to 500px (i believe by using the width attribute in the table tag). This looks weird because the prev/next should span across the entire element whereas it only goes halfway across the page, unlike the other elements.

The navigation at the bottom of the page however does this right, and stretches out to 100% width as it should. I believe the top part should do the same. You can achieve this by either setting the table's width attribute to 100%, or through CSS.

Just thought I'd point that out..
