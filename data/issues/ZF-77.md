ZF-77: Sort does not work for itemSearch()
------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-20T23:13:00.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.2 (06/Apr/07)

### Description

Setting the "sort" parameter of any query results in

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Service\_Exception' with message 'You have entered an invalid value for Sort'

e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $query->category('Books')->Sort('title')->Author('Doe, John'); 
    $results = $query->search() ;


probable reason: Variable $SearchIndex? is not set in function "\_validateItemSearch" of Amazon.php (references to $SearchIndex? variable should become $options['SearchIndex'])

Also: List of valid sort values in $\_searchSort should be language dependent

 
            (for example sort value "-pubdate" in category Books is valid for "DE" but not for "US")


Also: Variable $\_sortVerbs is apparently never used.

1. Using version 0.15, I am unable to repeat the "sort" parameter issue. I could not find any reference to any variables named "SearchIndex" ($SearchIndex).
2. I agree, the list of valid sort values in $\_searchSort should be language dependent. I'll try to work on a solution to this problem.

Here is just the difference between the US and DE sort values for the 'Books' category. [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceServ…](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/2006-06-28/ApiReference/USSortValuesArticle.html#books) [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceServ…](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEcommerceService/2006-06-28/ApiReference/DESortValuesArticle.html#books)

1. In 0.15 there still is no reference to the $\_sortVerbs array.

I believe this issue to have been resolved with [SVN r4357](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=4357). If this is not the case, please feel free to reopen with additional comment.
