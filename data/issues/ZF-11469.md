### Description

I was running default Zend\_Http\_Client over several sites to check some particular links when I received the following fatal error from one: Error Message : Unsupported operand types Error Location : C:\\wamp\\lib\\ZendFramework-1.9.6\\library\\Zend\\Http\\Client\\Adapter\\Socket.php line 388

The response header I was seeing this...

{quote} HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\\n\\r Content-Type: text/html\\n\\r Content-Length: 185\\n\\r Location: [http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/â€¦](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2010/11/apples-ipad-expensive-brits%5Cn%5Cr) Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\\n\\r Content-Length: 185\\n\\r Date: Fri, 10 Jun 2011 15:11:33 GMT\\n\\r Age: 0\\n\\r Connection: close\\n\\r X-Would-Your-GrandPa-Would-Wait: Yes He Would\\n\\r \\n\\r {quote}

The problem is that 'Content-Length' is included twice in this header (i guess this makes it malformed) and Zend\_Http\_Response::extractHeaders($response\_str) [line 493, called from Zend\_Http\_Adapter\_Socket line 314] consequently assigns the 'Content-Length' value in it's header return array as follows: bq.'Content-Length' => array(0=>185,1=>185) ...rather than just the value: bq.'Content-Length' => 185

This then becomes a problem in Zend\_Http\_Adapter\_Socket line 388 where the fatal erros is caused when it's assumed 'Content-Length' is an integer rather than an array (an attempt is made to perform addition with it).

Sorry I'm a bit of a Zend Framework newbie so I'm uncertain as to what the best solution solution is, but presumably it's a good idea to check for this so that a fatal error is not thrown due to 'Content-Length' being included.

Perhaps similar sanity checks should also be made on some of the other header items?

P.S. I have absolutely no idea what 'X-Would-Your-GrandPa-Would-Wait' is about!!
