### Description

__Defining the environment__

I recognised those two problems trying to send Doctrine-models via AMF.

On PHP-side i have typical doctrine-classes in a specified relation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    abstract class BaseArea extends Doctrine_Record
    {
        public function setTableDefinition()
        {
            $this->setTableName('area');
            $this->hasColumn('id', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'primary' => true, 'autoincrement' => true, 'length' => '4'));
            $this->hasColumn('content_id', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'length' => '4'));
            $this->hasColumn('followed_by', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'length' => '4'));
        }
    
        public function setUp()
        {
           $this->hasMany('Point as Points', array('local' => 'id',
                                                    'foreign' => 'area_id'));
        }
    }
    
    abstract class BasePoint extends Doctrine_Record
    {
        public function setTableDefinition()
        {
            $this->setTableName('point');
            $this->hasColumn('id', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'primary' => true, 'autoincrement' => true, 'length' => '4'));
            $this->hasColumn('top', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'length' => '4'));
            $this->hasColumn('left', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'length' => '4'));
            $this->hasColumn('area_id', 'integer', 4, array('type' => 'integer', 'length' => '4'));
        }
    
        public function setUp()
        {
            $this->hasOne('Area', array('local' => 'area_id',
                                        'foreign' => 'id'));
        }
    }


Normal access to depending objects (in this case Points) works like this in PHP:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $result = Doctrine::getTable('Area')->findAll();
    
    foreach($result[0]->Points as $point) {
       // do some freaky stuff with this point
    }


Points is a Doctrine\_Collection implementing ArrayAccess.

__First problem__

Fetching an $area-instance from the db and sending it via AMF does not serialize the Points. This happens because Zend\_AMF does not know that there is a "hidden" property called "Points" as it is only handled via the magic functions \_\_get and \_\_set (see doctrine source code for this). Now thinking about how to solve this i think i know, that AMF cannot be changed to use a configuration parameter like "concernMagicProperties":

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $server = new Zend_AMF_Server();
    $server->concernMagicProperties = true;


Well. I think this is not possible (and maybe also not practical for all occasions). So i made the following change. Doctrine supports adding kind of "unused" fields like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $area->mapValue('_hiddenFields', array('Points'));


This makes sure Doctrine continues to work (and does not complain about integrity with the database) and Zend\_AMF can access this property to find out which hidden fields should be serialized. In a normal environment with the same problem (not using Doctrine) this could be reached by an public property \_hiddenFields which will not be serialized or, maybe more beautiful (this idea just comes to my mind), implementing a Zend\_AMF\_Value\_MagicBehaviour:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Zend_AMF_Value_MagicBehaviour {
        /** @return array ***/
        public function getHiddenFields();
    }


__Second Problem__

After changing Zend\_AMF to implement the first behaviour (using the public property \_hiddenFields) i recognised the second problem: AMF serializes the Doctrine\_Collection as a named object - which is entirely correct, but the problem is, that there must be a matching AS-class which would have required me to implement sort of my own AS-Doctrine-Collection with the big problem, that the property names are unknown at the time of compilation (the properties are called 1 2 3 4 5...) and as AS has no possibility to handle this - or i don't know it (no magic \_\_set or so) - the only possibility was to change Zend\_AMF so that this class gets serialized as an Array. AS has enough ways to change this array and send the list back.

To solve this i made a dirty hack in Zend\_AMF to check whether the given object is an instance of Doctrine\_Collection and handle it as array. More beautiful would be a similar behaviour as mentioned above:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Zend_AMF_Value_HandleAsArray {}


If a class implements this Interface, Zend\_AMF should handle the object as an array (not only if it IS an array).

_Summarizing there are two problems to solve:_

- How can magic "hidden" properties be serialized
- How can classes that implement ArrrayAccess or extend ArrayObject be serialized as an Array

I documented my specific changes in a patch which might not be the best, but it was a fix for me to use Doctrine. I would like to hear your opinion on this topic, also if there is another way of design.

(offtopic: btw: why doesn't zend framework trac has codeformatting for php? ;-) )

Here's a hack I wrote to send Doctrine models via AMF: <http://cesaric.com/?p=303>. It'll get all the nested collections of a data graph and convert them to standard objects and ActionScript ArrayCollections.

On a similar note, any luck going the other way around in trying to send ActionScript objects over AMF to the corresponding Doctrine model object?

I can't seem to get ActionScript classes to map to the respective Doctrine model classes. I'm using the $server->setClassMap(); method and it works fine as long as I'm not mapping to a php class that extends "Doctrine\_Record" (my BaseContact class below does extend Doctrine\_Record). If I comment out "extends BaseContact" below, Zend\_Amf type casts it just fine.

class Contact extends BaseContact {

 
    public function construct(){
        $this->mapValue("_explicitType","com.example.vo.ContactVO");        
    }


}

Any suggestions? Btw, great work on Zend\_Amf. It's coming along nicely!

The 'Doctrine\_Record' may not be available to your php service at the time amf is deserializing the objects. Hack open one of the amf files, put reference to a Doctrine\_Record in there. If you get an error, there's your problem.
