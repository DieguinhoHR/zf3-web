This method only exists on Zend\_Form\_Element\_File; it will not work for other elements.

I have just checked trunk and the 1.8 release branch, and this method _does_ exist in Zend\_Form\_Element\_File in both places. The only revision of Zend\_Form\_Element\_File in the 1.8 release branch was created when the branch was created.

You either do not have 1.8.0, or you have an earlier version of Zend Framework installed earlier on your include\_path.
