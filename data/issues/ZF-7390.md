### Description

When having attributes in the topmost element of an xml file, they are not parsed by Zend\_Config\_Xml (ZF 1.9 beta1) e.g.:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $string = <<
    EOT;
    $config = new Zend_Config_Xml($string);
    var_dump($config->toArray());


would output

 
    <pre class="literal">
    array
      'someconfig' => 
        array
          'webhost' => string '<a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a>' (length=15)
      'anotherconfig' => 
        array
          'webhost' => string '<a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a>' (length=15)


instead of

 
    <pre class="literal">
    array
      'someconfig' => 
        array
          'webhost' => string '<a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a>' (length=15)
      'anotherconfig' => 
        array
          'webhost' => string '<a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a>' (length=15)
      'test' => string 'test' (length=4)


I think the simplest way to solve this would be adding the following after line 106:

 
    <pre class="literal">
                foreach ($config->attributes() as $name => $value)
                {
                    $dataArray[$name] = (string) $value;
                }

I'm fairly certain this is an issue due to how PHP's DOM library handles the root node of an XML file, but I'll leave the final resolution to Rob and/or Ben.

It's more reliable to simply have a child node with that value.

No, actually this would be possible, tho at the moment, Zend\_Config\_Xml always assumes the first level nodes (within the root node) to be sections, and a section cannot be a string value but a parent of nodes. I have to see if I will find a way around that when refactoring Zend\_Config\_Xml.

But seriously, according to this example, sections are used here, so I don't see a reason for a text-section.

Well, this only is a problem when you have config files that don't make use of sections. Another problem (for me) is that "$thisSection = $element->$section;" at line 156 always refers to the same element even if there are multiple elements with this name in the section.

Not a supported use case. Top level keys in Zend\_Config\_Xml are sections.
