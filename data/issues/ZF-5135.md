ZF-5135: Zend Loader can't find my extended Zend\_Controller\_Action

### Description

Hi,

In my controllers, I have created a "Base controller" where by my base controller extends Zend\_Controller\_Action, sets up properties for my view (in the constructor) then my controllers extend this class.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // in /application/controllers
    abstract class SupportbaseController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
    //etc
    
    
    then I can do
    class IndexController extends SupportbaseController
    {
    //etc
    }
    


This works fine in 1.6.2, but in 1.7.1 I get: {quote} WARNING (Zend\_Loader::include\_once(SupportbaseController.php) [function.Zend-Loader-include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory) in /xxxxxxxxxx/Zend/Loader.php at line 83 {quote}

If I manually require the file, it all works fine, so it looks like it can work out that "SupportBase" is a controller (i.e. it is looking in the root, rather than the application/controller directory)

I accept that I could have done something wrong, or trying to do something that ZF isn't designed to to (but the documentation isn't too clear is it) - and this works fine in 1.6.2.

Thanks, James.

I'm having the same issue, and I was able to work around it the same way James did.

Are we really in error here or is it a coder error? In other words, am I doing something wrong that used to be ok?

Thanks! Greg

Is '.' on your include\_path? If not, add it.

Hi, Matthew:

Thanks for taking the time to reply!

Yeah, '.' is on our path. First thing in bootstrap's set\_include\_path(), in fact.

Thanks, Greg

Hello James,

I experienced same problems when switching from version 1.6 to 1.7. My workaround is to append the path of my controller directory to the include path.

Say, your directory structure is:

/application /models /controllers ... /library /Zend ... /public index.php

So, in your index.php you would have something like that: ... define('INDEX\_PATH', realpath(dirname(**FILE**))); $paths = array( INDEX\_PATH . '/../library', INDEX\_PATH . '/../application/models', INDEX\_PATH . '/../application/controllers', get\_include\_path() ); set\_include\_path(implode(PATH\_SEPARATOR, $paths)); ...

As with version 1.6 it worked without this explicit inclusion of controllers directory to the include path.

Regards, Sebastian.

Hi Sebastian,

Yes, I've applied something very slightly different, but on a similar principle; the thing that is bugging me is that it works in 1.6, and not in 1.7, which does imply an undocumented change (or at least something changed to start working how it should, in which case I've done something wrong).

Although set\_include\_path at run time is an expensive operation (compared to it being set in php.ini)

Matthew - yes "." is on my include path as well - any other help would be appreciated (again, is this a ZF fault, or something that (now more than one person) has done incorrectly)

Thanks.

Same issue here. In Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php in ZF version 1.6 lines 341 to 349 the loadClass() method uses Zend\_Loader::loadFile() with this code:

 
        $dir         = dirname($loadFile);
        $file        = basename($loadFile);
    
        try {
            Zend_Loader::loadFile($file, $dir, true);
        } catch (Zend_Exception $e) {
            require_once 'Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception('Cannot load controller class "' . $className . '" from file "' . $file . '" in directory "' . $dir . '"');
        }


in ZF version 1.7 lines 337 to 340 the loadClass() method now uses include\_once() with this code:

 
        if (!include_once $loadFile) {
            require_once 'Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception('Cannot load controller class "' . $className . '" from file "' . $loadFile . "'");
        }


My temporary patch to get it working for me is to comment out the new 'include\_once()' code in the new Standard.php (directly above) and paste in the old 'Zend\_Loader' code (also above). I'm not sure of the best way to work around this in the bootstrap.

The relevant Zend\_Loader::loadFile code is as follows: public static function loadFile($filename, $dirs = null, $once = false) { self::\_securityCheck($filename);

 
        /**
         * Search in provided directories, as well as include_path
         */
        $incPath = false;
        if (!empty($dirs) && (is_array($dirs) || is_string($dirs))) {
            if (is_array($dirs)) {
                $dirs = implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $dirs);
            }
            $incPath = get_include_path();
            set_include_path($dirs . PATH_SEPARATOR . $incPath);
        }
    
        /**
         * Try finding for the plain filename in the include_path.
         */
        if ($once) {
            include_once $filename;
        } else {
            include $filename;
        }
    
        /**
         * If searching in directories, reset include_path
         */
        if ($incPath) {
            set_include_path($incPath);
        }
    
        return true;
    }

Hi James,

Thanks for finding that - brilliant; I concur; I've been through the source of Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php, and the lines you mention have changed from:

Zend\_Loader::loadFile($file, $dir, true);

to

include\_once $loadFile

I think the key point is that in 1.7.1, previous to the new include\_once, it doesn't utilise as much of the following (that 1.6 with Zend\_Loader::loadFile did)

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
    332         $loadFile    = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $this->classToFilename($className);
    333         $dir         = dirname($loadFile);
    334         $file        = basename($loadFile);


So there is a change, which has caused code to break - what we (still) need to establish is should we now write code in a certain way to now reflect this change?

Thanks.

With 1.7+ release there was a BC break. You have to Namespace you classes like MyApp\_SupportController to get it working with the new introduced autoloader mechanism. Otherwise you have to add it to the include path.

If not true, please provide a working setup with path and application layout.
