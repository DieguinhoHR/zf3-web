ZF-7859: Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_ItemFeed extending wrong class?
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-09-16T05:05:58.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-05-04T23:18:29.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I think Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_ItemFeed is extending the wrong class.

Current: Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_ItemFeed <- Zend\_Gdata\_Feed

Expected: Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_ItemFeed <- Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_Feed

The problem is, that Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase\_ItemFeed is not registering Gbase namespaces.

Zend\_Gdata\_Gbase was discontinued by Google on June 1st, 2011 and has been removed from Zend Framework in 1.12.0. The classes remain, but will throw a Zend\_Exception when instantiated.
