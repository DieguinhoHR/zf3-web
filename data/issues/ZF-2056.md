### Description

The variable gets overwritten when there's more than one disc.

Row 154-158 in Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Item:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($result as $disk) {
        foreach ($xpath->query('./*/text()', $disk) as $t) {
            $this->Tracks[$disk->getAttribute('number')] = (string) $t->data;
        }
    }

Ok, this was my first issue, sorry for the [code]. I hope you understand anyway.

Instead of: $this->Tracks[$disk->getAttribute('number')] = (string) $t->data;

It should be: $this->Tracks[$disk->getAttribute('number')][] = (string) $t->data;

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Will be fixed in 1.8 or as of trunk revision r12666.
