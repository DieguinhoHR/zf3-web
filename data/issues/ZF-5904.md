-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

code to reproduce:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $f = Zend_Feed::import('<a href="http://www.laut.de/partner/allgemein/news.rdf">http://www.laut.de/partner/allgemein/news.rdf</a>');
    var_dump($f->title());
    
    echo $f->getDom()->tagName;


actual output: null rdf:RDF

expected output: channel laut.de - news

This patch solves the problem, all unit tests still pass.

Someone who knows where this is needed should fix the problem.

Ok, my patch is obviously wrong - as feed elements don't work anymore with it :D

so the only issue is that $feed->title() isn't working properly.

Please note that any missing or non-standard behaviour will not be fixed. Users are advised that Zend\_Feed is basically deprecated (not in ZF2) and they should use/migrate to Zend\_Feed\_Reader/Zend\_Feed\_Writer which are far more comprehensive, adherent to all standards, easier to use, simple to extend for RSS/Atom extensions and which have somewhere in excess of 1000 unit tests to back those statements up (or was it almost 1500?). Anyway - I almost broke my fingers in testing ;). Using the newer components will also make transitioning new functionality to ZF2 that much easier.
