### Description

I want to use Zend\_Serive\_Yahoo::webSearch() to search for websites but I get some notices (E\_NOTICE) when I search for "flabben":

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Server\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Service\\Yahoo\\WebResult.php on line 97 Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Server\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Service\\Yahoo\\WebResult.php on line 98 Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Server\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Service\\Yahoo\\WebResult.php on line 97 Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Server\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Service\\Yahoo\\WebResult.php on line 98

Here my code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$yahoo = new Zend_Service_Yahoo($appId);
    $results = $yahoo->webSearch('flabben');

I am getting valid results and I can use them but I think no api should cause notices.

Attached xml result so you can try to find out what is causing these notices.

If there is still something in my xml result that can be used by others to use my account, please let me know so I can deactivate actual application id and create a new one.
