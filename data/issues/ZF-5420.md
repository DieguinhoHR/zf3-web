I have Zend\_OpenID working without any problem on my localhost in 1.7.1 and 1.7.3.

However, some providers like Yahoo do not accept localhost consumers and will always return a non accepted login. I know that myopenid.com accepts localhost consumer login requests - try that provider with your code to verify if the problem is the provider.

I have also implemented a localhost provider and it works as expected too, there's no URL limitation or filter by default.

Hello Patrik,

meanwhile I have found out that it works on my machine with localhost URLs like <http://www.something.localhost>. But before I had something like <http://www.something.test>, which didn't work. Nevertheless, I would like to close this bug.

Cheers, Timo.
