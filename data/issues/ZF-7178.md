ZF-7178: ZendPDF::save() may fail when mb\_detect\_encoding returns false

### Description

When saving a PDF with improperly encoded data, mb\_detect\_encoding() can return boolean false, which Zend\_PDF::render() does not expect. This causes mb\_convert\_encoding to fail with Warning: Warning at /www/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Pdf.php:737: mb\_convert\_encoding() [function.mb-convert-encoding]: Illegal character encoding specified

In my experience improperly encoded PDFs are ubiquitous, so Zend\_PDF should be able to handle them instead of expecting the input data to be perfect.

Attached is a patch for how I believe a failed mb\_detect\_encoding() should be handled, and files to reproduce the problem.

Zend Issue #ZF-7177 also applies here
