ZF-1066: isDate() returns true for dates that do not appear to be valid
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    The above returns true, because getDate()/_parseDate() was able to extract a month from the input, even though the resulting array of date parts is not a valid date:


array(3) { ["date\_format"]=> string(1) "M" ["locale"]=> string(2) "en" ["month"]=> int(4) } ```

<http://www.php.net/checkdate> checks dates, but see reader comments, and test if checkdate() works for very small and very large years.

Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate should not check if the given string is a proper date. It should check if the string contains a date.

Therefor the following changed will be done:

Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() will return true if a string contains all given date format tokens. Standard is all date parts present

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Locale_Format::isDate('12.April'); // false because year is missing
    Zend_Locale_Format::isDate('12.April', array('date_format' => 'dd.MMMM')); // true because we expect not to have a year
    Zend_Locale_Format::isDate('12.April.2007', array('date_format' => 'dd.MMMM')); // true because the minimum required date parts are present, year is additional present


Zend\_Date::isDate() will parse the date and fail if the date itself is no proper date (for example 30.2.2007)... Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() will parse a string and fail if the string contains not the wished date parts (for example 12.April)...

The reason is quite simple: Zend\_Locale\_Format localizes a date string and fail if something is wrong with the string. Zend\_Date works with dates and fail if a date is wrong.

Included the change with SVN 4107. Added also some unit tests for isDate() showing the additionally new behaviour.

isDate() will be integrated into Zend\_Date soon.

The normalizing function isDate has been changed to checkDateFormat, see ZF-1067. Unit tests and docu has been changed to reflect the changes.
