### Description

Reply to comment:

The fact that $routeTwo doesn't look correct is exactly the issue. I'm passing in the baseURL ('/app') in my case which is how the current code knows the strip the first four characters (strlen('/app') = 4.) The problem that is it's possible for the router to encounter URLs which do _not_ have the correct baseURL value and therefore they shouldn't have their initial characters stripped. The use case is when one would like to build a "routing" controller which transposed (legacy in my case) URLs (completely arbitrary) to MVC-formatted URLs (baseUrl/module/controller/action/.) One can do this today, using a legacy URL routing approach per $routeTwo, but it's odd and non-obvious...

My proposal is to use a regex to determine if the initial characters of the URL _match_ the provided $baseURL before stripping the initial characters of the request URI and to not modify the request URI if they do not match.

P.s. I gave the ``` thing a try but it doesn't seem to like my syntax for some reason. Sorry...

Initial report:

If you have a baseURL set, setPathInfo's implementation strips the length of the baseURL from the request URI, not the baseURL's value itself. This makes it difficult to setup Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_\* rules to route from legacy URL(s) to Zend Framework MVC+mod\_rewrite URL(s). Example:

$router = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite(); $routeOne = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static( '/directory/index.php', array( 'module' => 'someModule', 'controller' => 'someController', 'action' => 'someAction' ) ); $routeTwo = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static( 'ectory/index.php', array( 'module' => 'someModule', 'controller' => 'someController', 'action' => 'someAction' ) ); $router->addRoutes(array($routeOne , $routeTwo ));

$frontController->setControllerDirectory(array('default' => '../application/default/controllers', 'api' => '../application/api/controllers')) ->setRouter($router) ->setBaseUrl('/app');

RouteTwo "matches" but RouteOne does not. Because the first four characters are missing (strlen('/app')) there are potential issues with naming overlap.

Suggested fix, replace:

Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php:551 if ((null !== $baseUrl) && (false === ($pathInfo = substr($requestUri, strlen($baseUrl)))))

with

Zend/Controller/Request/Http.php:551 if ((null !== $baseUrl) && (false === ($pathInfo = preg\_replace("/^".$baseUrl."/", "", $requestUri))))

This will cause the baseURL to be stripped for requestURI's which have it, but not alter requestURI's which don't - allowing a developer to handle that case with their own routing.

I think part of your code was stripped on submission, as the route indicated in $routeTwo does not look correct. (Use ``` to enter code)

Looking at your "solution", the only difference I see is that it appends an additional '/' to the $baseUrl when stripping it. Have you tried changing the baseUrl you pass to the front controller to include the trailing '/'?

Please add more information on how to property reproduce and reopen.

Thanks, Ralph
