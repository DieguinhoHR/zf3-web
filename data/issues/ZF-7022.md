ZF-7022: clarification for form->addElement

### Description

Docblock currently reads:

If a Zend\_Form\_Element is provided, $name may be optionally provided, \* and any provided $options will be ignored.

However extending options for passed in element objects is not currently possible, IMO the docs should state "if configuring by string, optional options may be passed, if passing object options are ignored". Although it would be even cooler to mimick the javascript / jquery configuration extend idiom ( an options object can be extended by another options object to override stuff ).

Basically if a form class has a default order, why wouldn't the programmer want ( or at least from the current docs expect ) to be able to add the element with a different order. It seems all you would need is a little call to ->setOptions().

umm the tracker hosed my text. I guess because of astericks when I was copying the before and after docblocks, you should be able to decipher what I meant.
