ZF-9458: Zend\_pdf : deleting pages and $pdf->save()
----------------------------------------------------

### Description

I open a pdf file I delete some pages using unset($pdf->pages[$id]); and I save the file $pdf->save($filename) If I open the file with a pdf reader I see only the remaining pages. But since the resulting file size was basically the same size I opened it with a text editor to check it and I found out the all the deleted pages are still there. It seem that deleting pages unlink them from the visualization but not delete the info from the file content. I dunno if this is the normal behaviour of the save method.

Looking at the api I saw that there is a parameter, so I tried to use $pdf->save($filename, $updateOnly) with $updateOnly=true. I thought that this is the way to have only the remaining pages in the file, so as result I expect to have the file with only the remaining pages (both visualization and file content).

As result I got a file that apparently has only the remaining pages (looking at the size) but all the pages are blank, no text in them.

The behavior is correct. If $updateOnly save() method parameter is set to true, then incremental update PDF format capability is used. It allows to update PDF file by appending new data to the end of existing file (list of pages, pages content, etc.)

If you need to extract several pages from large source document and want to reduce target document size, then cloning page functionality (which will come with ZF 1.11) could be used:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $page1 = clone $pdf1->pages[$templatePageIndex1];
    $page2 = clone $pdf2->pages[$templatePageIndex2];
    $page1->drawText('Some text...', $x, $y);
    $page2->drawText('Another text...', $x, $y);
    ...
    $pdf = new Zend_Pdf();
    $pdf->pages[] = $page1;
    $pdf->pages[] = $page2;


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $extractor = new Zend_Pdf_Resource_Extractor();
    ....
    $page1 = $extractor->clonePage($pdf->pages[$templatePageIndex1]);
    $page2 = $extractor->clonePage($pdf->pages[$templatePageIndex2]);
    $page1->drawText('Some text...', $x, $y);
    $page2->drawText('Another text...', $x, $y);
    ...
    $pdf = new Zend_Pdf();
    $pdf->pages[] = $page1;
    $pdf->pages[] = $page2;


The second example is more efficient if pages share any resources (fonts, images and so on).
