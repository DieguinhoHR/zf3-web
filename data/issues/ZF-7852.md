### Description

Removed unneccessary require\_once of Zend\_Rest\_Client when it is never used. Zend\_Rest\_Client was being included in the constructor even when Zend\_Http\_Client is already included and is the only one being used.

Also renamed class property Zend\_Service\_Simpy::$\_http to Zend\_Service\_Simpy::$\_httpClient. I hope I am not going to far with that it just seemed that is the standard naming convention.

Matthew, The comment

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @see Zend_Service_Rest
     */


Is still in constructor.
