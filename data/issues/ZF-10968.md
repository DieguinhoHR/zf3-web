### Description

Search with $index->setResultSetLimit(4); and without gives different results. Most top (and that right) result in full search does not list at all in limited resultset. Didn't actually test, but as i can see there is still that problem in repo. Problem located in Zend/Search/Lucene.php, sorting is later than fetching limit, so it gets not top hits, but random one.

 foreach ($query->matchedDocs() as $id => $num) { $docScore = $query->score($id, $this); if( $docScore != 0 ) { $hit = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryHit($this); $hit->id = $id; $hit->score = $docScore;

 
        $hits[]   = $hit;
        $ids[]    = $id;
        $scores[] = $docScore;
    
        if ($docScore > $topScore) {
            $topScore = $docScore;
        }
    }


// LIMIT IS HERE if (self::$\_resultSetLimit != 0 && count($hits) >= self::$\_resultSetLimit) { break; } }

if (count($hits) == 0) { // skip sorting, which may cause a error on empty index return array(); }

if ($topScore > 1) { foreach ($hits as $hit) { $hit->score /= $topScore; } } //SORTING IS HERE if (func\_num\_args() == 1) { // sort by scores array\_multisort($scores, SORT\_DESC, SORT\_NUMERIC, $ids, SORT\_ASC, SORT\_NUMERIC, $hits);
