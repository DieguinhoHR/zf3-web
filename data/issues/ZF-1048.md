### Description

We frequently use ! in passwords, for example this produces an error: [foobar] foo = bar!

This doesn't: [foobar] foo = bar

Zend\_Config\_Ini uses parse\_ini\_file behind the scenes. Looking at [http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://uk3.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php), I see that you could try using double quotes around "bar!".

However the manual page also says: "Characters {}|&~![()" must not be used anywhere in the key and have a special meaning in the value.".

Regards,

Rob...

Rob's comment explains this to be expected behavior, because of the use of parse\_ini\_file(). The [Zend\_Config\_Ini documentation](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.config.adapters.ini.html) mentions this, as well.

(Sorry to add more noise here.)

Thanks for clearning this up. I must have overread where it said that it relies on PHP's function parse\_ini\_file. After I knew that the fix was fairly simple...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foo = "bar!"


I still think that if an error (of any level) is generated from the parse\_ini\_file(), it should be wrapped into an exception.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
