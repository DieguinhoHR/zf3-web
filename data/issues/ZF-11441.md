### Description

Validation error strings from Zend\_Captcha\_ReCaptcha and Zend\_Captcha\_Word should be also included in resources\\languages\\en\\Zend\_Validate.php - they can be translated and used the same way.

patch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        // Zend_Captcha_ReCaptcha
        "Missing captcha fields"=> "Missing captcha fields",
        "Failed to validate captcha" => "Failed to validate captcha",
        "Captcha value is wrong: %value%" => "Captcha value is wrong: %value%",
    
        // Zend_Captcha_Word
        "Empty captcha value" => "Empty captcha value",
        "Failed to validate captcha" => "Failed to validate captcha",
        "Captcha value is wrong: %value%" => "Captcha value is wrong: %value%",

As Zend\_Captcha is an own component shouldnt the ressource strings also be integrated within this component? Because Captcha is no validator within Zend\_Validate Having a resources\\languages\\en\\Zend\_Captcha.php would be the correct way how resources are meant to be created
