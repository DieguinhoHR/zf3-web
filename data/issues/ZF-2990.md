### Description

Hi, I am using AjaxContext helper and I think it should be modified to put appropriate headers to not cache content. Otherwise seems a bit unusable..unless I missed something.

I need some help; what headers would be useful to you? What configuration options might each need (such as expiration date, etc.)?

Once I have this information I can begin work. Until then, I'm postponing for 1.7 release at the earliest.

Hi, I am not really sure what are appropriate headers here as it seems different browsers understand those caching stuff quite differently. In general I think it makes sense not to cache request... (of course configurable will be best). I am currently using component as is... can't say I experienced bad behaviour or something but still. Just thought that this might be relevant when ajax context.

Actually... this is something that is probably best done in other places: \* In your view script \* In the action itself, once a context is detected \* In your .htaccess or vhost definition, via mod\_expires \* Client-side (Dojo and jquery both have mechanisms for preventing caching of requests, as do others)
