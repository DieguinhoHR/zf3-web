### Description

PHP 5.3 will warn about \_\_get magic call not being public.

Warning: The magic method \_\_get() must have public visibility and can not be static in /home/squeaky/workspace/www/squeaky/lib/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 247

Changing

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function & __get($name)


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function & __get($name)


resolves issue.
