### Description

Certain classes in Zend are not very easy to extend because they extend on multiple levels. For example, extending Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text requires a few runarounds to avoid adding much code to the standard codebase. It would be very helpful to have Zend already released with a complete set of class shells that extend each Zend class.

example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class ZendExt_Form_Element_Text extends Zend_Form_Element_Text
    {
     // empty shell class
    }
    
    class Zend_Form_Element_Text extends ZendExt_Form_Element_Xhtml
    {
      // standard zend class
    }
    
    class ZendExt_Form_Element_Xhtml extends Zend_Form_Element_Xhtml
    {
      // empty shell class
    }
    
    class Zend_Form_Element_Xhtml extends ZendExt_Form_Element
    {
      // standard zend class
    }
    
    class ZendExt_Form_Element extends Zend_Form_Element
    {
      // empty shell class
    }
    
    class Zend_Form_Element implements Zend_Validate_Interface
    {
      // standard zend class
    }


This is my current setup and I am able to customize zend form elements completely without having to touch Zend itself, making it easier to update. It would have helped me a great deal to have this from the get go.

Assigning to Matthew as this is a design issue. Frankly, I don't see the benefit of such class shells, but maybe I'm missing something. Extending framework classes should be done entirely in user-land code IMO.

I see absolutely no benefit to this. If you need to alter the behavior of a class, you extend it using your own class prefix, and then inform your Zend\_Form instance of that prefix. This allows you to drop in your own replacements while still allowing you to use the dynamic features of Zend\_Form; it also allows you to selectively choose which types of elements you override. This is fully documented, and I've written a number of tutorials on the subject.
