ZF-2087: Strange behavior with YYYY
-----------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-10-19T05:10:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-10-19T05:26:16.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.3 (30/Nov/07)

### Description

Here is an example :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('31/12/2007', 'dd/MM/YYYY');
    echo $date->get('dd/MM/YYYY');


Result is :

 
    <pre class="literal">
    31/12/2008


I use yyyy instead of YYYY to avoid this strange result.

I work on ubuntu platform PHP : 5.1.6 Locale : FR

No, this is no bug.

YYYY is defined as ISO-8601 year. ISO defines that the year begins with the first week including a thursday. (something like that).

This means that if a day like the 31.12 belongs to the first week of the next year it will also be displayed for the next year. Same for the week.

This is why this date displays 2008 as year and not 2007.

If you need the real-date you should use "yyyy" as this is the real-year value and not the ISO defined year. Otherwise it would have no sense to define two constants for year values.

ISO years are normally used for week/year outputs for example used within calendars.
