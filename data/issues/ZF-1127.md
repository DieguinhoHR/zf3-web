These tests should be skipped on Windows. It's also strange that cygwin is still able to read the files after a chmod 0. The problem is it's necessary to make the file unreadable without removing it to test for a fopen error.

Bill could you tell me what you get with this script: <?php echo PHP\_OS; echo php\_uname(); ?>

Currently I'm using the PHP\_OS check I found in [http://php.net/php\_uname](http://php.net/php_uname) . Maybe it's better to check for 'Windows' in the result of php\_uname(). It works with Windows XP (without cygwin).

Ok forget my question. I'm now stat()ing the file after the chmod(). Windows returns 0444, for readonly, which is the only supported flag. Cygwin should to the same.

I'm closing the bug, but please test again with Cygwin. I set the version to 0.9.1 - guess that's your target with such a high priority ;)
