Looking through sequences and the lastIdInsert solution for Oracle I found no reason why the surfix of the sequencename should not be lowercased.

There is no benefit or problem according to this.

Feel free to reopen this issue when you have additional informations or reproduction code related to this issue.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.
