ZF-2114: wrong headers EOL for DATA part in SMTP Protocol
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Headers for emails which transport is set to Smtp are separated by the function \_prepareHeaders with the $EOL property which is set to "\\n" in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp.

The same headers are parsed by the data method in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp and exploded by a self::EOL class constant. This constant is declared in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract as equal to "\\r\\n". This results in not separating headers and in the residual presence of '0A' characters between headers lines instead of the expected '0D0A'.

This can cause problems with some email servers respecting strict standards.

The solution I see is to declare the class constant EOL for Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp as equal to "\\n" in accord with the $EOL declaration in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp class.

The data parsed in the data() method in ZF 1.0.2 is exploded via Zend\_Mime::LINEEND - are you using the most recent revision of the Mail components?

Thank you for your answer.

I'm just using version 1.0.2.

I'm talking about line 288 in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp and the 'exploder' I see is self::EOL

This change was already fixed in trunk but looks like it missed out being included for ZF 1.0.2. Try replacing these components with the latest versions from the nightly snapshot or update your repository using subversion and you'll see the fix.

No further evidence of bug - please re-open only if using newer ZF 1.0.3 release and condition still exists.
