### Description

When sending mail in utf-8 and using quoted printable encoding there is problem with (.) dot character if this char is placed at wrap position. for example

&email=3Duser@domain.= com

if text is

&email=3Duser1@domain.= com

then . after domain is removed and you actually get

&email=3Duser1@domain= com

This happened in html and text mode.

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for 0.7.0 release.

I test this with latest trunk and it look like this was duplicate of ZF-326. But I see that there was still problems with some line endings. What's the status of this problem?

Hi Uros - can you see this behaviour any more?
