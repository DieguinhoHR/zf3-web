ZF-4462: Zend dojo form editor IE bug 
--------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-10-03T05:42:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-01-13T05:59:17.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

IE seems to send back the content of the dojo editor in an "Editor" variable, instead of the variable that was defined by the user when the form was build (FF is using that one).

Ex :

$form->addElement( 'Editor', 'content', array('id' => 'content') );

Ok, I'd expect the content of the editor to be in the "content" variable, accessible by $\_POST['content']

Now submit the form gives :

Array ( [title] => bug test 2 [content] => Array ( [Editor] => bug test 2 ) [sendlive] => 0 [id] => [save] => save )

That's not the case with IE, sending the content of the editor in an array inside the content variable

The same request using firefox :

Array ( [title] => test [content] => test bug firefox [sendlive] => 0 [id] => [save] => save )

Ok, FF works fine.

Please grab the generated markup, and post it to the Dojo mailing lists and/or bug tracker. Unfortunately, we cannot support Dojo-specific issues, only issues that are specific to the Zend Framework Dojo integration (i.e., creating invalid markup and/or JS).

Actually, the issue is with the Editor View Helper using the Textarea. It's fixed by using the Div tag instead of the textarea as the markup.

$html = '<input' . $this->\_htmlAttribs($hiddenAttribs) . $this->getClosingBracket(); // . $this->textarea($textareaName, $value, $params, $attribs); $html .= '

\_htmlAttribs($attribs) . '>' . $value; $html .= '

This may be fixed in ZF 1.9.7, as we no longer use a textarea for representing the Editor dijit.
