ZF-114: Support extra information identified by names with underscores
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-21T22:12:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:09.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.2 (06/Apr/07)

### Description

The manual ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.service.flickr.html)) documents Zend\_Service\_Flickr\_Result as having the following properties:

owner\_name, date\_taken

However, these properties are not set correctly. Flickr actually returns the following variables:

ownername, datetaken

I assume this is the same for other variables with underscores

The [Flickr API documentation for the flickr.photos.search method](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) indicates that the options such as owner\_name and date\_taken are specified using the underscore character.

Indeed, the /response/ from Flickr does _not_ use underscores to name these options.

I just wanted to comment at this time that I have confirmed this erroneous behavior.
