ZF-3631: Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit: Cannot set value that differs from name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-11T19:12:40.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-08-04T06:10:42.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

The value attribute of a Zend\_Form\_Element\_Submit appears to be tightly coupled with the id and name attributes. Thus, it is not possible to set a value independent of the element's name/id. This also prevents one from displaying spaces in the submit button value (e.g. "Add Category").

Please read the documentation more closely. To set the display text of the submit button, specify a label for the element. The label is used as the input value attribute (and, for Button elements, the text of the button).
