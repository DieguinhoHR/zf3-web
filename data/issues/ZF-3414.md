### Description

Hello,

While i was working with an application i noticed there are significant differences on redering of and on browsers.

IE does render much better than . Problem is on ZF there is no view helper to render button as . The formButton view helper renders as .

So i think would be useful to allow somehow rendering as also.

The original behaviour was to use an element. However, contributors and users felt this was too limiting (you cannot use arbitrary HTML in such an element), and we chose to use . If you want a standard input button, you will need to create your own view helper.
