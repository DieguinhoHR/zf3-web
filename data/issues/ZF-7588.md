ZF-7588: Expose sorting/grouping functionality from pagination adapters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-08-13T13:15:59.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:52:39.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Working with a data grid component and Zend\_Paginator can be a bit clumsy when there are sorting and grouping parameters defined at run time that may or may not exist.

We probably need to expose sorting and grouping functionality from the pagination adapters, enforced via an interface. For the purposes of backwards compatibility, this would likely be a separate interface from the regular adapter interface. Arrays, for example, may be sorted via a heap implementation (but this would not be required for this ticket; the database adapters would be the primary focus).

The ultimate goal of this ticket and ZF-5376 ("Allow Zend\_Paginator to Accept An Infinite Item Count Per Page") is to make Zend\_Paginator objects flexible enough that they can be used as a universal data access mechanism.
