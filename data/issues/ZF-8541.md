### Description

The bug is reproducible in a system with Windows XP with Japanese as the language setting. A service file EmployeesService.php lies under the directory <a>D:/wamp2.0i/www/こんにちは</a> Now this directory is added using Zend\_Amf\_Server 's addDirectory(). Calling any function on EmployeesService from flex application leads to following error:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Warning: include_once(EmployeesService.php) [function.include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in D:\wamp2.0i\www\ZendFramework\library\Zend\Loader.php on line 135
    
    Warning: include_once() [function.include]: Failed opening 'EmployeesService.php' for inclusion (include_path='D:/wamp2.0i/www/縺薙ｓ縺ｫ縺｡縺ｯ\.;.;C:\php5\pear;D:/wamp2.0i/www/ZendFramework/library') in D:\wamp2.0i\www\ZendFramework\library\Zend\Loader.php on line 135


Note that the include path shows a completely different path.

In Japanese localized Windows, path is written by sjis-win (aka. cp932, ms932).

But, this issue seems to happen not only for the specified language. In other languages, which caracter encodings are used for Windows?

I believe other localized version would cause same problem like as this.
