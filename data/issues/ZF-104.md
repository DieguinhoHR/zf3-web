### Description

Hi,

Did not see an example of how to create custom headers and footers with the Zend PDF resource?

Can this be done?

Not sure exactly what this means. You can draw pretty much anything you want on a page.

Are you asking for some sort of _automatic_ header and footer generation on every new page?

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

Depends on document representation model, which should be designed before.

Postponed to post-1.0 period

headers and footers are very important features for corporate branding, do you plan any implementation or should we look at other pdf libraries?
