Trevor, is this still an issue? I'll send out a mail to you, Ryan, and Jochen so we can get a clear answer. Please close if this documentation is no longer planned.

Yes, this is still an issue, and something I'd like to see added. The code is in place to submit raw XML and is used quite frequently form what I see on mailing lists, but the manual does not explain this functionality.
