### Description

Currently, the plugin broker does no exception handling, which means that if a plugin throws an exception, it escapes the ErrorHandler plugin, thus leading to a possibly broken site.

The proposed solution is to wrap all calls to plugins with try/catch statements:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($this->_plugins as $plugin) {
        try {
            $plugin->HOOK_NAME();
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            if (Zend_Controller_Front::throwExceptions()) {
                throw $e;
            } else {
                $this->getResponse()->setException($e);
            }
        }
    }

Since some plugins or actions may require the successful completion of a plugin, we will need an API in the request object for retrieving and checking exceptions. The proposed API is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $response->hasExceptionOfType($type);                                                           
        $response->hasExceptionOfMessage($message);                                                     
        $response->hasExceptionOfCode($code);                                                           
        $response->getExceptionByType($type);                                                           
        $response->getExceptionByCode($code);                                                           
        $response->getExceptionByMessage($message);

Resolved in r5499; documentation for response object updated to reflect new API.
