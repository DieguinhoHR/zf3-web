### Description

The description of "getGenerator()" on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.writer.html) is wrong. While the method name is "getGenerator" it is pretty clear that the text is trying to describe the setGenerator method. It also says that the method takes an array with three keys; it actually takes $name, $version, and $uri arguments, in that order.

Similarly, the description of getDateModified actually refers to setDateModified.

Resolved in r22094.

The setGenerator description was intended to be correct - I've added changes to the source code to make this a reality. As a result I've also marked the prior methodology of multiple params as deprecated in the test suite (it won't be removed until ZF 2.0).
