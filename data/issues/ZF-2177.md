### Description

Add a performance testing harness that will allow for measuring response times both one at a time and under load. This harness should work well and provide accurate results in our currently established performance testing environments. These tests should optionally provide an reasonable environment for testing other frameworks and web dispatching architectures. Must be able to test operations such as Lucene index creation as well.
