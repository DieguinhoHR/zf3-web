### Description

Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim uses trim(), so there are two problems. - It does not filter the characters like U+0085 next line and U+00A0 no-break space. -- You can use preg\_match('/^[\\s\\p{Zs}\\p{Zl}\\p{Zp}]+$/u', $str) to see what characters are white spaces in UTF-8. - If the trim\_charlist parameter includes multibyte characters, it does not work as expected. -- The returned string is cut in the middle of the multibyte character.

$trim\_charlist = " \\t\\n\\r\\0\\x0B・。"; $filter = new Zend\_Filter(); $filter->addFilter(new Zend\_Filter\_StringTrim($trim\_charlist)); $s = $filter->filter($value);

There is neither mb\_trim() function or iconv\_trim function in php core. We need to trim with preg\_replace or something. @see <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=23501> [http://php.oregonstate.edu/manual/en/…](http://php.oregonstate.edu/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php#87047)

Changed to improvement as even PHP itself does not support this feature
