ZF-2746: Zend\_Form should implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface

### Description

Zend\_Form should implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface, and already does -- with the exception of type-hinting on the isValid() method. Removing that and putting the type checking into the method itself would allow Zend\_Form to implement Zend\_Validate\_Interface, thus allowing it to be used as an all-purpose validator for data-sets -- which could allow swapping it in where Zend\_Filter\_Input has been used previously in models.
