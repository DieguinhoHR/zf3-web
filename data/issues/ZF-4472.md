This one is interesting....

He expects "delimiter= ;" but found "delimiter=;"... same for "testoption" and "ignore".

Clear should be false but he got 1 ?? Could it be that phpunit does no longer ignore the order of array entries ?

It seems order is important.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->assertTrue($arr == $expectedArr)


should work.

Probably fixed with r11751
