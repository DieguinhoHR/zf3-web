ZF-10496: cURL adapter should set CURLOPT\_NOBODY when performing HEAD request

### Description

With some websites, a HEAD request using cURL would give the message

"Error in cURL request: Received problem 2 in the chunky parser".

This problem was fixed by adding the line:

curl\_setopt($this->\_curl, CURLOPT\_NOBODY, true);

to Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Curl.php, right after $curlValue = "HEAD".

I believe this makes cURL ignore whatever inconsistencies it finds between the returned header and (chunked) body.
