### Description

h3. Problem

Fixing issue ZF-1778 created new issue:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('mysqli', ...);
    
    $stmt1 = $db->prepare('UPDATE A SET B=?');
    $result1 = $stmt1->execute(array('1'));
    
    $stmt2 = $db->prepare('UPDATE B SET C=?');
    $result2 = $stmt2->execute(array('2'));
    
    // this will fail (return false), because initiating stmt2 will close stmt1.
    $result3 = $stmt1->execute(array('3'));


h3. Solution

Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Prepare a statement and return a PDOStatement-like object.
    *
    * @param  string  $sql  SQL query
    * @return Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli
    */
    public function prepare($sql)
    {
        $this->_connect();
        if ($this->_stmt) {
            $this->_stmt->close();
        }
        $stmt = new Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli($this, $sql);
        if ($stmt === false) {
            return false;
        }
        $stmt->setFetchMode($this->_fetchMode);
        $this->_stmt = $stmt;
        return $stmt;
    }


should be changed back to ( version commit [pre 5906](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/viewrep/Zend_Framework/branch/release-1.0/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php?r1=5867&r2=5906)):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Prepare a statement and return a PDOStatement-like object.
    *
    * @param  string  $sql  SQL query
    * @return Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli
    */
    public function prepare($sql)
    {
        $this->_connect();
        $stmt = new Zend_Db_Statement_Mysqli($this, $sql);
        if ($stmt === false) {
            return false;
        }
        $stmt->setFetchMode($this->_fetchMode);
        return $stmt;
    }


h3. Should be reconsidered

NB! Fixing this problem rises ZF-1778 again, thus logic should be reconsidered.

IMHO "Fixed code" is more correct because same logic is used in pdo abstraction class Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
    * Prepares an SQL statement.
    *
    * @param string $sql The SQL statement with placeholders.
    * @param array $bind An array of data to bind to the placeholders.
    * @return PDOStatement
    */
    public function prepare($sql)
    {
        $this->_connect();
        $stmt = new Zend_Db_Statement_Pdo($this, $sql);
        $stmt->setFetchMode($this->_fetchMode);
        return $stmt;
    }

Please categorize/fix as needed.

the questions is wheather ZF-1778 also appears for PDO. I think it only works when using with mysql and set to unbuffered resultsets. I will try maybe...

Reassigning to Ralph to bring closure to this issue.

It would be nice to get this fixed, as it's contrary to advice given. (see ZF-10930)

This is a limitation in mysqli, not Zend\_Db. Mysqli can only have a single buffered statement open at a time, that is why the previous statement must be closed before a new one can be utilized. This is the reason why mysqli\_multi\_query(). In order for us to be able to accomplish this, we'd have to do a dance with mysqli\_store\_result() inbetween preparations. Since we have no context for how you are using the Statement or more specifically, how much data you have in a result set, we cannot simply assume that you'd like to store that in PHP space (as opposed to keeping the data inside the mysql connection).

Long story short, if you need multiple statements at once, you should be looking at PDO.
