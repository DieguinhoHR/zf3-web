ZF-1466: Include error file and line number in error messages
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Posting on behalf of [~coogle]:

Include the file and line # in your work around to throw exceptions on session start; otherwise when that error actually happens the error is meaningless without knowing where in your code it actually was thrown.

Example solution below:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Session_Exception
    {
        static public function handleSessionStartError($errno, $errstr, $file, $line)
        {
            self::$sessionStartError = $errstr . " ($file:$line)";
        }
    }


Probably this should also be done for the handleSilentWriteClose() method; hiding error information cannot be good. ;)

You can print a very nice compact stack trace using Exception::\_toString() method. It gives you all the information you need.

Karol, that is correct. And since this Exception/error handling code is isolated to a very specific call session\_start, there is little need to add any information to the error message itself (since the exception stack has line and file information in it).
