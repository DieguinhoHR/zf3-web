ZF-2600: isValid() function unexpected behavior

### Description

Zend\_Form seems to validate unrequired elements when it should not.

_Case in which this strange behavior occurs:_

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $POSTDATA['name'] = 'x';
    $POSTDATA['age'] = ''; //not required, but posted empty
    Zend_Form->isValid($POSTDATA);


_What happens:_ Zend\_Form validates age, because the array key was set

_Expected behavior:_ Zend\_Form skips age, because the value was empty

_Possible fixes:_

1 Add a strict option to the method (backwards compatible)
==========================================================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isValid(array $data, $strict = true) {
            $valid = true;
            foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
                if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                    if ($element->getRequired()) {
                        $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
                    }
                } else {
                    //Changed
                    if (($element->getRequired()) && ($data[$key] != '') && ($strict == false)) {
                        $valid = $element->isValid($data[$key], $data) && $valid;
                    } else {
                        $valid = $element->isValid($data[$key], $data) && $valid;
                    }
                    //Change end
                }
            }
    // etc.. etc..*/ 
    }


2 Just change the behavior
==========================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isValid(array $data)
    {
     $valid = true;
            foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $element) {
                if (!isset($data[$key])) {
                    if ($element->getRequired()) {
                        $valid = $element->isValid(null, $data) && $valid;
                    }
                } else {
                   //Changed
                    if (($element->getRequired()) && ($data[$key] != '')) {
                        $valid = $element->isValid($data[$key], $data) && $valid;
                    } 
                   //Change end
                }
            }
    //etc.. etc..

I'm assuming this behaviour was observed using the Preview Release, and not current trunk.

Earlier this week (week of 3 Feb 2008), I added the ability to allow non-required values to be empty, and made this the default behaviour. To override that behaviour (i.e., make a non-required value also require validation when present), you must call:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->setAllowEmpty(false);


Please verify what version of ZF you are using (preview release, snapshot (if so, which one), or current trunk).

I first used the preview 1.5 release, then downloaded a snapshot to see if the problem was still there ZendFramework-20080207-7833-en

It doesn't seem to be fixed in the latest snapshot either ZendFramework-20080208-7862

I cannot recreate the issue. I've got the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElement('text', 'username')->getElement('username')
          // Note: the following line is unnecessary; elements are optional 
          // by default. Doing this simply to be explicit.
          ->setRequired(false)  
          ->addValidator('stringLength', false, array(1, 64));
    
    $data = array('username' => '');
    
    if (!$form->isValid($data)) {
        var_export($form->getMessages());
    } else {
        echo "Form validated";
    }


The expected result is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Form validated


And that's what I receive. Are you certain you are using code from the latest trunk (i.e., that you are pointing your include\_path at the new snapshot you downloaded)?

Oh, you're right, i get the same when linking to the snapshot version.

I just looked for the fix, expecting it to be in the Zend\_Form, but you fixed it in Zend\_Form\_Element.

Anyway, great job on writing Zend\_Form. I was quite disappointed that 1.0 didn't came with it.

Fixed in a revision earlier this week (week of 3 Feb 2008)
