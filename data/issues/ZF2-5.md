### Description

For example:

File: application.ini

 
    <pre class="literal">
    [production]
    
    ; Regular keys
    this.that = "abc"
    
    ; Import a config file
    import = "/subfolder/routes.ini"


XML version (application.xml)

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    abc

For XML, simply use xincludes:

```

Don't know, if it is supported by the current Zend\_Config\_Xml implementation, needs to be checked. For INI, it should also be called include, and not import.

One addition to INI files:

1. I would use ":include" to make it different to an option named include.
2. xinclude could use on different sections. This should also work on INI files. Example:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    include = "option value of include"
    :include = "./cfg2.ini"
    
    group.include = "option value of group.include"
    group:include = "./cfg2.ini"


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    option = "value"


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
        'include' => 'option value of include',
        'option'  => 'value',
        'group'   => array(
            'include' => 'option value of group.include',
            'option'  => 'value',
        )
    );

Having spoken with Matthew, this is something we'd like to see.

I'm not likely to get to it any time soon, so if anyone would like to take this on (and has signed the CLA), please let me know!

I'm carrying this out.

But before going further, I'd like to dicuss a bit the approach.

I'm not fond of the ':' operator since it's already used by default as inheritance operator. I would suggest something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    phpSettings.display_errors = false
    
    ; inserts the content of subset/common.ini 
    ; just like if it were typed directly here
    @include subset/common.ini
    
    ; imports all ini files from the resources.d sub-directory 
    ; using their name (without extension) as key
    resources = @import ressources.d/*.ini
    


with other files in ressources.d/ looking like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ; as it is imported from a "db".ini file, these keys
    ; will be treated as db.*
    adapter = "pdo_mysql"
    params.host = "localhost"


this approach aims at mimicking apache2.conf and php.ini ones.

it allows to separate whole parts of the configuration.

What do you think about this?

To use "@" instead of ":" it's ok for me ;)

Your part to include multiple files by wild-cards is an interesting idea and I have the following questions/issues to this: 1. It will be only supported by ini-files or is there an xinclude port of it?

1. Which wild-cards should be available? -> Only \*, ? -> Or usage of glob or fnmatch
2. resources = @import ressources.d/_.ini -> There is no way to create an real option value "@include foobar" Why not using (Don't tested it yet): resources@import = ressources.d/_.ini or resources.@import = ressources.d/\*.ini

Additional: Is the a chance to import config files of different types ? like @include subset/common.xml

Greetings

> 1. It will be only supported by ini-files or is there an xinclude port of it? To be honest I'm not a big fan of XML, and don't it that well - so I would say that if such an implementation exists, well, we can manage to support it :)
> 2. Which wild-cards should be available? -> Only \*, ? -> Or usage of glob or fnmatch I feel like glob would do the trick - if I don't use it, I'll be forced to use/emulate regexp, which probably wouldn't be more efficient. So glob is a good candidate for me.
> 3. resources = @import ressources.d/_.ini -> There is no way to create an real option value "@include foobar" Why not using (Don't tested it yet): resources@import = ressources.d/_.ini or resources.@import = ressources.d/\*.ini I didn't test neither yet, but I feel like it would be easier and more efficient not to parse the key part of the file. Using key = hard\_coded\_value / @import/include/something\_else would be easier to handle. I wouldn't implement something to complicated if it's not to serve the usability of the component
> 
> Additional: Is the a chance to import config files of different types ? like @include subset/common.xml I guess it would be, but I think this would make harder to implement a caching mechanism, and overall, would be confusing to me :)

> Greetings Thanks a lot for your comment and suggestions!

Gauthier,

How far did you get with this?

Rob...

hi Rob,

well, I didn't have much time to work on it recently unfortunately...

If needed, I think I can manage to get it out in few weeks from here now.

Gauthier,

It was more a case of if you have code then it would be good to get a prototype and see if we could get it completed for ZF2.

Regards,

Rob...

well, I've got some good news... I worked a bit on my code today, and I managed to get something working. The bad news are that it's limited to .ini files (or ini formatted files to be more accurate), and does not support Zend\_Config\_Writer neither.

But his does the trick:

main.ini

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    key = "key value"
    @include = "conf.d/*.ini"
    
    [development]
    devKey = "test"


conf.d/db.ini

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    db.adapter = "mysql"
    db.param.host = "localhost"
    
    [development]
    db.adapter = "dev db adapter"


conf.d/phpSettigns.ini

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [production]
    phpSettings.display_errors = off


results in this array (generated by ->toArray() on the Zend\_Config\_Ini("main.ini", "production") object) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array(3) {
      ["key"] => string(9) "key value"
      ["db"] => array(2) {
        ["adapter"] => string(5) "mysql"
        ["param"] => array(1) {
          ["host"] => string(9) "localhost"
        }
      }
      ["phpSettings"] => array(1) {
        ["display_errors"] => string(0) ""
      }
    }


This works with one section or more, and also with no section at all. I tested it many ways, but only manually yet. I still have to write unit tests for it. But has it mostly does... nothing but instantiating new Zend\_Config\_Ini objects, it shouldn't need that many tests.. Moreover, by having add a "\_fileName" property, and thus creating an object for every file, it shouldn't be that difficult to add writing support...

What do you think about it (patch against latest svn version and full class file attached)?

patch against r23445 and full Ini.php files provided

I 'm disagreed with the way to process here. The ability to Imports a file is a good feature/idea but it sound like a big improvement and code remaniement. Also, any improvement like this must be ported in all adapters (eg. yaml, xml and so on) to be able to provide a common specification. BTW: I've your looked at the Symfony 2 to take idea for the way to process ?

In case of your proposal, required to be removed 'config' support from Zend\\Application::setOptions() method?

huh it looks like I didn't received update notices regarding this task... is this still expected to be done in ZF2?

 

 

Posted by Ben Scholzen (dasprid) on 2012-04-29T10:50:38.000+0000

Imports for INI and XML were added in ZF2, see the manual for further information.
