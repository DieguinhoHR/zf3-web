### Description

I think that atomic add/set functionality should be added to Zend\_Cache backends, to provide features needed to build proper locking.

The purpose would be to provide a uniform to the functionality provided by e.g.: APC: apc\_add <http://php.net/manual/en/function.apc-add.php>

Redis: SETNX <http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/SetnxCommand>

Memcache: add [http://code.google.com/p/memcached/â€¦](http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewCommands#add)

Additionally atomic incr/decr and setAndGet would be helpful.

This will be implemented with ZF2 on all backends (than storage adapters)

This issue won't be fixed in ZF1. -> fixed in ZF2-135
