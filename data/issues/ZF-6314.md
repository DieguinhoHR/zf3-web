### Description

You may want to add the following to the quickstart.css to take care of the overflow ([http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/…](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-a-model-and-database-table)):

div.code-sample code { overflow: auto; display: block; white-space:pre; }

Also you may want to add the note from the Zend\_Db Program Reference and a link to that section - [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.html#zend.db.adapter): "Each Zend\_Db Adapter uses a PHP extension. You must have the respective PHP extension enabled in your PHP environment to use a Zend\_Db Adapter. For example, if you use any of the PDO Zend\_Db Adapters, you need to enable both the PDO extension and the PDO driver for the brand of RDBMS you use. "

The quickstart will be rewrite in Docbook format and we will apply new documentation standard => overflow won't exist.

This job will be realize after 1.8 release.
