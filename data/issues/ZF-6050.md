### Description

I'm not the greatest programmer, so maybe I'm just being thick. But I don't think so...

Assume we have a MYSQL database with a table that contains a timestamp column. Use UNIX\_TIMESTAMP to convert the timestamp value into an int. When we try to access the property on the stdClass object returned from Zend\_Db\_Select, we get an error. Sample code below.

I am running ZF 1.7.6 and have replicated the error on a number of different local dev boxes and shared hosting environments...

If you could confirm the bug exists I would be grateful, as I've already spent a good few hours assuming it's my programming, not a ZF error.

try { //Enable Class autoloading include "Zend/Loader.php"; Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload();

 
    $db = new Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql(array(
        'host'     => $server,
        'username' => $user,
        'password' => $pass,
        'dbname'   => $dbname
    ));
    
    //Choose whether to get array or object here
    $db->setFetchMode(Zend_Db::FETCH_OBJ);
    
    // Create Zend_Db_Select object
    $Zend_select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);
    $Zend_select->from('tbl_page', array('page_id', 'page_title', 'page_edited', 'pageedited ' => 'UNIX_TIMESTAMP(page_edited)'));
    $Zend_select->limit($items);
    $query = $Zend_select->query();
    $rows = $query->fetchAll();
    
    foreach($rows as $key => $value) {
    
        if(gettype($value) == "array") {
            print $value['page_edited'] .  " " . $$value['pageedited'] . "<br />";
        }else{
            print $value->page_edited .  " " .  $value->pageedited . "<br />";
        }
    
    }


} catch(Exception $e) { print $e->getMessage(); }

//Let's do the same thing with mysqli directly try {

 
    $db2 = new mysqli();
    $db2->connect($server, $user, $pass, $dbname);
    $query = "SELECT page_id, page_title, page_edited, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(page_edited) AS page_timestamp FROM tbl_page";
    $result = $db2->query($query);


/\* fetch object array \*/ while ($obj = $result->fetch\_object()) {

 
        print $obj->page_edited . " " . $obj->page_timestamp ."<br />";
    
    }


} catch(Exception $e) { print $e->getMessage(); }

You need to wrap SQL expressions in Zend\_Db\_Expr:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $Zend_select->from('tbl_page', array(..., 'pageedited ' => new Zend_Db_Expr('UNIX_TIMESTAMP(page_edited)')));


Then you can simply access attributes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $rows = $Zend_select->query()->fetchAll();
    
    foreach($rows as $row) {
         echo $row->page_edited;
         echo $row->pageedited;
    }

Tried duplicating, but it appears the first commenter is correct. For db expressions, you should warp those in Zend\_Db\_Expr objects so that they are not quoted as values. Please reopen if you still feel there is an issue here.
