### Description

To support post-redirect-get operation of Zend\_Form (wherein a form is posted, processed, and either redirected to a success page, or back to itself to be re-entered).

The method should:

a) save the data in the form that passed validation b) save any error messages about data that failed validation.

The next time the form is displayed on a get request, it should display as if it were just rendered from post.

To support regression a new method

Zend\_Form::enablePRG() may be needed.

Benefit of this change -- forms will support forward-back navigation without generating re-posting data warnings (where data can potentially be resubmitted twice by accident)

Requires a larger scope view. Will be addressed later/differently.

Hi,

I think this may be more simpler.

On form initialization register a new namespace within Zend\_Session\_Namespace

Some hash like the implode of all fields, or something.

$this->\_formSession = new Zend\_Session\_Namespace($hash);

If the form passes isValid()? unset all params from session

$this->\_formSession->unsetAll();

else

$form->post = $\_POST $form->errors = $form->getMessages();

Before call the render method iterate on every form element and do something linke this

foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $value) { if (isset($this->\_formSession->errors[$key])) { $this->getElement($key)->setErrors($this->\_formSession->errors[$key]); } }

Same for default values If not passed isValid()

foreach ($this->getElements() as $key => $value) { if (isset($this->\_formSession->post[$key])) { $this->getElement($key)->setValue($this->\_formSession->post[$key]); } }

Something like this.

Don't know your idea...

I will take a deep looker at Zend\_Form and try to find a permanent solution.

This is a really nice Improvement that I would like to see...

Best Regards, Bento Vilas Boas
