ZF-1251: Zend\_Controller\_Plugin does not allow postDispatch notification on Action controller exception

### Description

for reference:

[http://nabble.com/Zend\_Controller\_Front-and-exceptâ€¦](http://www.nabble.com/Zend_Controller_Front-and-exception-handling--tf3476740.html#a9704789)

when action controllers render an exception, post dispatch is not notified in plugins due to the notifcation of postDispatch being the same try catch block that the exception would be thrown from.

concerning these few lines from the front controller:

- - - - - -


                 /**
                  * Dispatch request
                  */
                 $dispatcher->dispatch($request, $response);
    
                 /**
                  * Notify plugins of dispatch completion
                  */
                 $this->_plugins->postDispatch($request);
             } while (!$request->isDispatched());
         } catch (Exception $e) {
             if ($this->throwExceptions()) {
                 throw $e;


 }

it appears as though if an exception is thrown from the action controller, plugins are not notified of postDispatch(). Is this the intended behavior?

Aside from that, would be the best method for catching the following errors: Non-Existent Controller Non-Existent Action Exception Due to User Application Code

I've seen a few different attempts at a solution over the course of the different iterations of ZF Controllers, but still curious what people think?

Once we get the action helpers into core, we will have Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Exception present again. This will allow catching using the following:

- Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception => invalid controller
- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Exception => typically invalid action method, but possibly helper exception
- Exception => other application exception

I am in the process of modifying and testing the functionality as requested.

Early exception catching added in r4482.
