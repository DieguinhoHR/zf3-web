### Description

The content passed to the decorators render method is by default an empty string when no arguments are provided, this leaves Decorator\_Form always closing the tag since the viewhelper strictly type-checks for false.

Zend\_Form:3152

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $seed = '';
    if (0 < count($args)) {
        $seed = array_shift($args);
    }
    if ($decoratorName === 'FormElements' ||
        $decoratorName === 'PrepareElements') {
            $this->_setIsRendered();
    }
    return $decorator->render($seed);


I randomly checked several decorators but this seem to be the only "wrapping" decorator so the empty string(@see $seed) seems to be compliant with most of the decorators, maybe change it to below if so?

Zend\_View\_Helper\_Form:64 ```

At the moment you will always have to decorate the tags yourself(OMG <@:)) if you're not rendering the form through the decorator
