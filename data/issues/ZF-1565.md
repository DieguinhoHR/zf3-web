### Description

Some 'best practice' recommendations may already be added to Zend\_Search\_Lucene module documentation.

1. Don't use 'id' for stored field names.
2. Some recommendations for MaxBufferedDocs, MaxMergeDocs and MergeFactor settings for different usage modes (indexing, searching, batch indexing, indexing small/large documents).
3. Shut down index before the end of script (unset index object), so auto-commit will be done _before_ exception mechanism is shut down.

1. Do not use index on NFS (see flock() documentation).

1. If documents have any unique-id field, then documents should be retrieved through $index->termDocs() method instead of $index->find()
2. If index is not optimized than each segment has his own term dictionary and preloaded term dictionary index. It also increases search time (each search is actually several mini-searches through segments)

1. Encoding parameters usage.
