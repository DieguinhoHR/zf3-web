### Description

This is a request for validate classes that are like Alpha and Alnum, but which also permit whitespace.

So values like "1313 Mockingbird Lane" can be validated.

Suggested class names:

- Zend\_Validate\_AlphaWS
- Zend\_Validate\_AlnumWS

I was thinking it might make sense to augment the existing Alpha and Alnum filters to provide an option to permit whitespace, off by default, for backward compatibility. Then, the corresponding validation classes would simply proxy the option along to the corresponding filters they use. Thoughts?

How about do it in a way that encourages subclassing.

For example, make Zend\_Validate\_Alpha have a boolean property $\_permitWhitespace. This is set to false in Zend\_Validate\_Alpha and true} in Zend\_Validate\_AlphaWS, which extends Zend\_Validate\_Alpha.

Then Zend\_Filter\_Alpha takes the optional parameter, as suggested in ZF-1534.
