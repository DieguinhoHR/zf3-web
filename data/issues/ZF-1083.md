### Description

I can't get IDN hostname validation working at all as of r4097.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $tld = 'höhö.ch';
    $hostnameValidator = new Zend_Validate_Hostname();
    $hostnameValidator->setValidateIdn(true); // optional as IDN validation should be enabled by default
    if (!$hostnameValidator->isValid($tld)) {
        print_r($hostnameValidator->getMessages());
    }


prints:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [0] => 'höhö.ch' appears to be a DNS hostname but cannot match against hostname schema for TLD 'ch'
        [1] => 'höhö.ch' does not appear to be a valid local network name
        [2] => 'höhö.ch' appears to be a local network name but but local network names are not allowed
    )


while höhö.ch should be a valid IDN hostname.

I'll take a look into this, this may be some kind of character encoding problem

Philip,

Can you please try this script out (HostnameTestForm.php), you should access it via a web browser, and let me know if it works for you.

I have managed to replicate your problem though cannot see why its occuring at present. With UTF-8 it seems mostly down to character encoding and that can be a little tricky to pin down. The form based version above should work fine for when accepting IDN hostnames via POST

Thanks Simon. Check out your script at: <http://web.onlime.ch/HostnameTestForm.php> It won't work. I can't tell if my editor (joe under Debian Linux) messed up the encoding of your file. ZF is a "clean" checkout of r4172, no modified files there.

Looks like the upload process messed up the character encoding. I'll put together some test scripts and give you a link to them soon so we can get to the bottom of this

Just a note that Alexander Jäger (lx at survive-linux dot com) has also reported this issue. I'll send him a link to test files too to help resolve this issue.

Sorry about this bogus issue. This was just a charset issue. My files were ISO-8859-1 encoded and I didn't apply utf8\_encode() to the domain prior to passing it to the validator.

solution 1: Format all your files to UTF-8

solution 2: $tld = utf8\_encode('höhö.ch');
