### Description

When running unit tests, I get this fatal error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function gzinflate() in /usr/local/lib/php/ZendFramework-1.0.0/library/Zend/Http/Response.php on line 567

I guess if module needs it it should check for it, and/or unit test should skip it if it's not present.

Bookkeeping. Adding link to duplicated issue.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all closed issues to the person who ultimately fixed them.
