ZF-2956: Consider the rel-attribute in getLinks

### Description

It would be nice if the Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document\_Html would use the rel-attribute of links. The getLinks method no fetches all links of a document.

Patch:

Done.

I don't think it's good idea to have this behavior as default since 'nofollow' initiative is not a W3C standard. But it's really useful to have such option.

links with 'nofollow' rel attribute can be excluded now using the following code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Search_Lucene_Document_Html::setExcludeNoFollowLinks(true);
    $doc = Zend_Search_Lucene_Document_Html::loadHTML($html);


This functionality is merged into 1.5 and 1.6 release branches. So it will be included into ZF 1.5.3 and ZF 1.6 (documentation mentions it's only available starting from 1.6, so it's "undocumented" feature for the ZF 1.5.3)

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
