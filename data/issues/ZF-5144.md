ZF-5144: Variation of Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket with DNS caching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Attached is a minor variation of the Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket class that extends it to add DNS caching. This is potentially useful for improving performance under the following circumstances:

- The server operating system does not support DNS caching, either natively nor via installed software, or the developer using ZF does not have the necessary privileges to augment the server to that end.
- The ZF-based application using Zend\_Http\_Client targets multiple remote hosts and alternates hosts between requests more often than not or has another requirement that mandates establishing multiple connections to the same host or hosts over the course of its runtime.
