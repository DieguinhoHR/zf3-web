### Description

At the Zend\_Controller documentation, in Zend\_Rest\_Route usage section says literaly:

To enable Zend\_Rest\_Route for specific modules, construct it with an array of module names as the 3rd constructor argument:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $front     = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $restRoute = new Zend_Rest_Route($front, array(), array('product'));
    $front->getRouter()->addRoute('rest', $restRoute);


It then specifies that you can create a route using Zend\_Config and the controllers of some module can be configured by specifying as follow:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    routes.rest.type = Zend_Rest_Route
    routes.rest.defaults.controller = object
    routes.rest.mod = project,user


When I tried to configure a RESTful module using Zend\_Config, I figured that could be used as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    routes.rest.mod2 =
    // or 
    routes.rest.mod3[] =


But this fails, the error is in the getInstance method of Zend\_Rest\_Route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($config as $key => $values) {
      if ($key == 'type') {
        // do nothing
      } elseif ($key == 'defaults') {
        $defaultsArray = $values->toArray();
      } else {
        $restfulConfigArray[$key] = explode(',', $values);
      }
    }


In the else part of code should have a validation, since the value of the variable $value is an array or an empty string, and in these cases this fails. To be consistent in building RESTful modules using Zend\_Config, the code should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($config as $key => $values) {
      if ($key == 'type') {
        // do nothing
      } elseif ($key == 'defaults') {
        $defaultsArray = $values->toArray();
      } else {
        if (!empty($values)) {
          $restfulConfigArray[$key] = explode(',', $values);
        } else {
          $restfulConfigArray[] = $key;
        }
      }
    }


Sorry for my bad english.

Are you instantiating this through zend\_app?

 

 

Posted by Grover Campos Ancajima (gtux) on 2010-04-30T14:26:55.000+0000

Well, yes, is a normal plain zend project from zf tool.

Please beware that Zend\_Rest is explicitely not supported with zend\_app. Therefore closing as wont-fix.

Not really understand the answer given, leaves me the feeling that you had no interest in studying (or even reading) what I'm exposing.

- First, Please tell me explicitly: where does it say in the Zend\_Rest\_Route's documentation that can not be used with Zend\_Application?.
- Secondly, I would understand why in the documentation specifies how to use the Zend\_Rest\_Route using Zend\_Config or instancing an object. Please see [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.rest.route_usage)] and [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.rest.route_config)]? All that in order to use it with Zend\_Application, if I'm not wrong.
- Thirdly, if Zend\_Rest\_Route can not be used by Zend\_Application, then why is within Zend\_Controller's documentation: [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html#zend.controller.router.routes.rest)]?
- And last question if Zend\_Rest\_Route can not be used by Zend\_Application, what else can be used Zend\_Rest\_Route?

I'm sorry I wasn't clear on this before.

The zend\_rest component wasn't designed to be used with zend\_application (that may be because it was developed before zend\_app was, not sure about that). Also, its design differs quite a lot from the other type of routes there are. Though there are plans to make it work more in line with the other routes, that isn't possible for the moment because it would break backwards compatibility.

You can configure Zend\_Rest\_Route through Zend\_Application. You would however have to either write your own init method, or write a custom resource plugin.

To answer your questions in short:

- It may not have been described, nor has it been described that it can be used with zend\_app.
- The assumption is wrong. You dont have to use zend\_app\_resource\_route in order to set up zend\_rest with zend\_config.
- Zend\_Controller is a different component than Zend\_App. Zend\_App complements Zend\_Controller , not the other way around.
- It's just PHP, you can use lots of code with zend\_rest\_route, including your own. Just not zend\_app\_resource\_route...

If there are any questions left, feel free to ask them.

I would like to expose the bug from a different point of view, because apparently I was not clear before.

In documentation about Zend\_Controller, in Zend\_Rest\_Route section specifies how to use Zend\_Rest\_Route. It teaches how to get an instantiate of Zend\_Rest\_Route and add it to Zend\_Controller\_Front, and it also indicates how that can be added to an application using Zend\_Config so it can be instantiated automatically from the bootstrap.

So far everything works right, unless, in the form which Zend\_Rest\_Route is programmed, it not cover the ability to specify that a complete module can be RESTful using Zend\_Config.

Obviously this can be achieved from other forms, such as writing an init method in the Bootstrap itself (either the application's Bootstrap or specific module's Bootstrap), or through a custom plugin to give some examples.

What I propose is that it may be possible to use Zend\_Config to specify, in a simple way, that a complete module be RESTful style only changing a few lines in Zend\_Rest\_Route component, and take advantage of the simplicity of using a configuration file for the entire application using the tools that currently exist in Zend Framework and not give the job to the developers having to re-engineering to achieve this.

The code that I'm talking about is in getInstance method of Zend\_Rest\_Route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    foreach ($config as $key => $values) {
      if ($key == 'type') {
        // do nothing
      } elseif ($key == 'defaults') {
        $defaultsArray = $values->toArray();
      } else {
        if (!empty($values)) {
          $restfulConfigArray[$key] = explode(',', $values);
        } else {
          $restfulConfigArray[] = $key;
        }
      }
    }

In that case I'm reopening it, but only if it can be fixed without touching code in zend\_app.

It may be possible. I'm looking to do a slew of fixes and improvements before ZF 2.0 soon so I'll look at this at the same time.

Is there any thought on this making the 1.10 branch? Or should I use other means than Zend\_Config to get this to work in the next couple of months.

 

 

Posted by Luke Crouch (lcrouch) on 2010-06-02T06:18:18.000+0000

I'm planning a Zend\_Rest workday in the next week or two. I've been cautious about it since we don't know how much of Zend\_Rest will translate into 2.0. But I should be able to fix it soon.

This bug is still happening on 1.11.4: From Zend\_Config it's not possible to enable Zend\_Rest\_Route for a specific module.

The solution proposed by Grover Campos Ancajima is clean, easy to implement and it has no drawback. Is there any chance to have it implemented for the next version of ZF 1.11?
