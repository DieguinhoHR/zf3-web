ZF-7343: Problem deserializing multiple calls
---------------------------------------------

### Description

There still seem to be issues with the deserialization of multiple simultaneous calls as I still get a 'Net.Connection.Error' if multiple calls are made (I just upgraded ZendAMF to 1.8.4PL1).

My setup: I'm calling my web service from Flex with a NetConnection call. The web service is implemented with the Kohana framework. Using the ZendAmf component works great except for this flaw.

The Flex application makes 4 calls with the following parameters 1 - Object (String, String, String, String) 2 - String 3 - String 4 - String

The Request->readMessage() method recognizes 4 bodies and fails when reading the 3rd as $data (around line 185 in Request.php) is an empty array.

I have changed the sequence in which these calls are made and the error goes away if the call with the Object is the last. Unfortunately I can not force this sequence as the components making these calls can be arranged in an arbitrary sequence.
