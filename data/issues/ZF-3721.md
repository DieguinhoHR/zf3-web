### Description

The Zend\_Gdata\_PhotosOnlineTest test suite does not clean up after itself. This leaves the account used to run tests littered with albums and photos. Eventually the test account hits its upper limit on albums, causing tests to fail.

I believe [~jhartmann] is working on this. Assigning to him.

Not sure who fixed the tests as Fisheye seems to be down. Looks like all tests in PhotosOnlineTest have clean up methods, so marking this resolved as of 1.7.5
