### Description

Here is the issue:

I have a controller that generates an image and keep in session every time and how often this image is generated. I then have a view that calls this action like this ![customimage](/utility/customimage) . Now I am trying to write a test, but I can't because the action in the image tag is not getting dispatched.

NOTE: this is not a captcha.

This is not an issue with Zend Framework itself, but in the end user's application.
