### Description

findManyToManyRowset fails when using different column names on target table and intersect table (after commit 6251)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bugsTable        = new Bugs();
    $bugsRowset       = $bugsTable->find(1);
    $bug              = $bugsRowset->current();
    
    $bugsRowset   = $bug->findManyToManyRowset('Bugs', 'BugsProducts');


The error on findManyToManyRowset: {color:red}Notice: Undefined index: product\_id in /srv/sites/athweb-prt03/library/Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php on line 839{color}

When calling findManyToManyRowset the name of the column in the lookup table now has to be the same as the column name in the intersection table. Prior to commit #6251, column names did not need to match.

Changing the "id" column in both the products and bugs tables (schema below) to 'product\_id' and 'bug\_id' and make the corresponding changes in the referenceMap, findManyToManyRowset works.

The user should be able to specify unique column names.

The db structure that fails is:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    CREATE TABLE `bugs` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,  <--- this would need to be bug_id to work
      `bug_description` varchar(100) default NULL,
      `bug_status` varchar(20) default NULL,
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE `bugs_products` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY, 
      `bug_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
      `product_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
    );
    
    CREATE TABLE `products` (
      `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY, <-- this would need to be product_id to work
      `product_name` varchar(100) default NULL,
    );


The referenceMap is:

 
    <pre class="literal">
         protected $_referenceMap    = array(
            'Bug' => array(
                'columns'           => array('bug_id'),
                'refTableClass'     => 'Bugs',
                'refColumns'        => array('id')  <--- this would need to be bug_id to work
            ),
            'Product' => array(
                'columns'           => array('product_id'),
                'refTableClass'     => 'Products',
                'refColumns'        => array('id')  <--- this would need to be product_id to work
            )
        );

Reworded summary. (copied old summary into first line of description.)

Upgraded priority.

This regression was caused by changes made for ZF-1664. Linking to that issue.

Revision 6332 should fix the problem. Can you please update and test?
