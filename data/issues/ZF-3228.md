### Description

I would like to suggest the followin improvement for the Zend\_Form::setElementDecorators() method:

It should be possible to pass an array of elements. The passed array of decorators should be set for all of these elements. This should work both for excluding and including these elements. The method could look like this:

 
    public function setElementDecorators(array $decorators, array $elements, $include = true)
    {
    }
