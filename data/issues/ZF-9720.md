### Description

Thats the way I had initialized Zend\_Translation in bootstrap: <?php $locale = new Zend\_Locale(); Zend\_Registry::set('Zend\_Locale', $locale); $translate = new Zend\_Translate(Zend\_Translate::AN\_ARRAY, APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../languages/', 'auto', array( 'scan' => Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_FILENAME, 'log' => Zend\_Registry::get('Zend\_Log'), 'logUntranslated' => true, )); Zend\_Registry::set('Zend\_Translate', $translate); ?>

In languages folder create two translation files en.php and lt.php. Internaly those files looks like:

 <?php /\*\* \* English language file \*/ return array( 'token1' => 'text in english1', 'token2' => 'text in english2' ); ?> This part was working perfectly until I had made upgrade of ZF to 1.10.3. Sad, can't say what version was before. I guess 1.9.x. After some debugging I had realized, that Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Array::\_loadTranslationData as $data parameter can accept only string with path to translation or array of such strings for multiple translation files. Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Array::\_addTranslationData doesn't do anything with $data value, simply passes it to \_loadTranslationData. But structure of array passed has all (except the first) arguments passed to Zend\_Translate constructor.

If in Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Array::addTranslation method after line with this code:

 <?php $options = $options + $this->\_options; ?> I add something like this:

 <?php if (is\_array($data) && !empty($data['content'])) { $data = $data['content']; } ?> Translations start to work again. If that is really the way component is intended to be used, then I think this issue is feature breaker.

Not reproduceable in trunk.

In line 126, if options is a string (note that it should be an array according to API doc) it is converted to array('content' => options) which itself is accepted by addTranslation().

Using your example all works without problems without any changes to the component.
