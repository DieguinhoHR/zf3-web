### Description

Some very usefull enhancements for Zend\_Db.

Zend\_Db functionality for working with table structure.

Possible interface:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Table(); // extends Zend_Db_Table
    
    $table->deleteField(
        title // field title in DB
    );
    
    $table->addField(
        title, // field title in DB
        'VARCHAR', //type
        255, // length
        null, // default value
        ...
    );
    
    $table->alterField(
        title, // field title in DB
        'VARCHAR', //type
        255, // length
        null, // default value
        ...
    );


Functionality for table structure import into DB and export to xml or other format would be very usefull too.

Possible interface:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Table(); // extends Zend_Db_Table
    
    $table->importStructure('table_structure.xml');
    
    $table->exportStructure('table_structure.xml');

Perhaps Zend\_Table\_Schema? I'd be wary of adding too much functionality to the base class. Perhaps the schema object could accept an instance of an existing table to :-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new myTable();
    
    $schema = new Zend_Table_Schema($table);
    $schema->addField('fieldname', array('type' => 'VARCHAR', 'null' => true));
    
    $result = $table->fetchAll();


And you could use an instance of Zend\_Config to import the structure. I would assume a more generic Zend\_Config-type object would be passed for an 'exportStructure' method.

I think this would be a very useful addition as long as it's not too driver-specific. For instance, would you pass a generic string for field type, or create a more generic 'VARCHAR' property that can be translated into a specific database field type? That may make code more portable.

I think something of this magnitude should follow the [normal proposal process](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home).

Maybe, but i can't write proposal, cause i have no free time for this.

Ok. There are still opportunities to discuss these ideas on the fw-general mailing list.

If these ideas prove popular, someone else often summarizes the ideas and suggestions into a proposal.

Changing fix version to 0.8.0.

A general class for database metadata operations is a large subject.

This is not to be covered in the issue tracker. Any discussion should be done in a proposal.
