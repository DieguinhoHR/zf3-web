ZF-7915: Check session\_set\_save\_handler() and throw exception if it failed to set saveHandler
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If session is already started, Zend\_Session::setSaveHandler(new Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable()) silently fails to set session\_set\_save\_handler(), but Zend\_Session::getSaveHandler() shows that saveHander is set successfully. I added 2 checks to ensure that session was not started before and session\_set\_save\_handler() successfully changed saveHandler.

Still not fixed? Issue is pretty reasonable. I have been wondering, why my session db table is empty while php sessions were working. I.e. calling session\_start() before setting save handler causes session save handler to fail silently.

What can be done to have this fixed?
