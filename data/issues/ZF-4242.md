### Description

\*\* EDIT \*\*

I'm not sure what changed in my configuration, but it seems to be working now.... though not with single quotes (though i am not sure if single quotes are supposed to qualify a phrase at this point)

- - - - - -

search by phrase using Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_QueryParser::parse no longer works in version 1.6.0

using example search text:

city:'philadelphia, pa'

or

city:"philadelphia, pa"

a print\_r of

$query->getQueryTerms()

returns

Array ( [0] => Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term Object ( [field] => city [text] => philadelphia )

 
    [1] => Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_Term Object
        (
            [field] => contents
            [text] => pa
        )


)

in version 1.5.3 it returned a Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Phrase Object with a subarray of terms

Searching by phrase must be done with double quotes, as documented in the [reference manual](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.query-language.html#zend.search.lucene.query-language.terms)

Resolving this as not an issue.
