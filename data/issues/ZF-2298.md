ZF-2298: quoteInto changes value when an array is passed as second argument.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-12-12T10:28:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-08-27T10:20:20.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.9.3 (22/Sep/09)

### Description

When passing an array to $adapter->quoteInto() as the second argument, the function changes the values of the array. For example:

// names = Array ( [0] => php [1] => google [2] => working ) $names = array( 'php', 'google', 'working' );

$where = $dba->quoteInto('name IN (?)', $names)

// print the existing array print\_r($names);

// prints out // Array ( [0] => 'php' [1] => 'google' [2] => 'working' )

Notice quoteInto() has now added single quotes to each value in the array, which is unexpected behavior. This was specifically recreated using the MySQL db adapter using Zend \_Db\_Table.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Cannot reproduce, with latest trunk I tried the unit test below, and it passed fine. Appears that everything that is passed into quoteInto() comes out as it went in.
