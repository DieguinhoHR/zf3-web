It did not work. I use PostgreSql version 1.8.4

My sugestion:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sql = "SELECT c.relname  AS table_name "
                  . "FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c "
                  . "JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles r ON r.oid = c.relowner "
                  . "LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace "
                  . "WHERE n.nspname <> 'pg_catalog' "
                  . "AND n.nspname !~ '^pg_toast' "
                  . "AND c.relname !~ '^(pg_|sql_)' "
                  . "AND c.relkind = 'r' ";

My fault, this commit wasn't suppose to be in branch but only in trunk that's why the "Fix Versions" field was "Next minor release" I will revert it in branch ASAP.

I failed to answer and have to re-edit the ticket..

All is to know what do you realy expect when using show tables. Query provided is fine.

Perhaps you just want to select like that :

select table\_schema, table\_name from information\_schema.tables where table\_schema <> 'pg\_catalog' and table\_schema !~ '^pg\_toast' and table\_schema <> 'information\_schema';

or just ommit the is\_visible from the First query, but _please_ keep clear of that : "AND c.relname !~ '^(pg\_|sql\_)' " which is useless and can just lead to errors. (damn! do you really suggest I can not have a table name "sql\_zend" or "pg\_rox" ?!)
