### Description

The documentation rather directly implies that one cannot use Zend\_Http\_Client with a DIGEST auth scheme.  
[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.client.advanced.html)

{quote} HTTP Authentication

Currently, Zend\_Http\_Client only supports basic HTTP authentication. This feature is utilized using the setAuth() method, or by specifying a username and a password in the URI. The setAuth() method... {quote}

This is rather misleading, if not completely a misnomer. As Zend\_Http\_Client fully supports the php's cURL library, one can simply configure Zend\_Http\_Client with the cURL Adapter (Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl).

What is technically correct, is that the public method setAuth() of Zend\_Http\_Client only supports BASIC. Not the entire Zend\_Http\_Client utility - as implied.

This needs to be stated much more clearly. Development efforts are taking alternate platform / framework direction based on the sentence in question. Obviously, if the reader continues on, and is familiar w/ cURL in PHP, this fact can be discovered. However, the simple statement "Zend\_Http\_Client only supports basic HTTP authentication" stands out and can cause the reader to stop there - feeling the the statement is final.

example:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
            $adapter = new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Curl();
            $adapter->setConfig(array(
                'curloptions' => array(
                    CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH    => CURLAUTH_DIGEST,
                    CURLOPT_USERPWD     => "$username:$password"
                )
            ));
            $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
            $client->setUri("http://<a href="www.example.com">www.example.com</a>");
            $client->setAdapter($adapter);
            $response = $client->request();
    


This simple example of digest Authentication w/ the curl adapter should be included in the documentation.
