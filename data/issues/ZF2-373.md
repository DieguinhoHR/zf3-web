### Description

Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Adapter#query should have definition like query($sql, $parametersOrQueryMode = self::QUERY\_MODE\_PREPARE, ResultSet\\ResultSet $queryResultSetPrototype = null), because it makes mapping custom raw queries to custom row objects possible.

There are better workflows for this, $adapter->query() is really only there as a matter of convenience. What is your use case?
