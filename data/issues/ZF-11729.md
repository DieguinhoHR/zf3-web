Can you please provide: \* A simple form that demonstrates/reproduces the issue \* The expected markup from rendering the form \* The actual markup from rendering the form

This will make it easier for us to verify the issue, as well as provide a test for it.

Thanks!

//code in action $form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->addElement('text','random-element-name',array( 'label'=>'This is weird', 'value'=>'think its a bug', )); $form->addDisplayGroup(array('random-element-name'), 'foobar',array( 'legend'=>'foobar', )); $this->view->form = $form;

//output

 This is weird    foobar This is weird //expected (element now named random\_element\_name)

  foobar This is weird
