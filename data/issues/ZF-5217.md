### Description

Invoking the following code (from /demos/Zend/Gdata/Health.php):

 
    <pre class="literal">$client = new Zend_Gdata_HttpClient();
    $client->setAuthSubPrivateKeyFile('/file/that/doesnt/exist', null,
                                      true);

Causes the following error to be printed indefinitely:

 
    <pre class="literal">Warning: feof(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in
    /Users/trevorjohns/Projects/zf/library/Zend/Gdata/HttpClient.php on line 99
    
    Warning: fread(): supplied argument is not a valid stream resource in
    /Users/trevorjohns/Projects/zf/library/Zend/Gdata/HttpClient.php on line
    100

Infinite loop fixed. An exception is thrown now is the file cannot be opened.
