ZF-6312: Fix enableRequestDebugLogging

### Description

Looks like the change to add streaming uploads broke the ability to log requests since it switches out the socket adapter dynamically. Looking at the original code, I was confused on how it ever worked since it sets an adapter but if the http\_client is already instantiated, that shouldn't actually do anything.

Rewrote some parts of App.php to make this work and added the necessary files.
