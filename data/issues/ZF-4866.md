ZF-4866: ContextSwitch appends suffix multiple times when \_forward() is called
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When using ContextSwitch, if you \_forward() to another action for which ContextSwitch is also active, the new suffix is prepended again. Thus, instead of simply "xml.phtml", you get "xml.xml.phtml".

I'm unable to reproduce this. However, when \_forward() is called, and the newly called action does not have a matching context, then the context view suffix from the original action is assumed -- which is incorrect behavior. As an example, if action A defines and detects an xml context, and then forwards to action B, which defines only a json context but does not detect it, the view suffix xml.phtml will be re-used. More appropriate is to use the original view suffix (phtml) -- or, in the action method, determine if a valid context was found.

I will fix the code so that the original view suffix is returned.
