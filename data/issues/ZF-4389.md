ZF-4389: Make Zend\_Config able to update config files
------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, it is not directly possible through Zend\_Config, to update the config files from which a configuration was loaded. I would suggest to add a ``` is true). Hence it is not really possible to preserve the config format the user used (e.g. intendation, use of attributes in Zend\_Config\_Xml), the save() method would just write the data in a generic given format.

The question would be, what about sections? When section A extends section B, Zend\_Config doesn't know about the sections anymore after loading the config, and also not, in which section to write new data. This is a problem which I couldn't solve yet (in my opinion, a writable config file does not require sections, as it is a config file which is dynamically updated at runtime, and thus doesn't depend on enviroments).

Any comments?

See ZF-2838.

I'd prefer to see the ability to write out configuration files in a separate class (Zend\_Config\_Writer maybe?) for two reasons: 1. Zend\_Config doesn't need the bloat. 2. It's a non-trivial problem that doesn't map exactly to reading the config file.

Regards,

Rob...

Agreed, as discussed in IRC, I'm going to create a proprosal for an appropriate Writer interface.
