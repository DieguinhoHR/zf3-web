ZF-7193: Config with "elements" should not remove existing elements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-07-04T17:54:03.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:32.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">$form = new Zend_Form ();
    $form->addElement ('Submit', 'submit');
    var_dump ($form->submit); // The element
    
    $form->setOptions (array('elements'=>array()));
    var_dump ($form->submit); // null

I dont expect, that setOptions() will reset the form. Especially I expect, that if a element is defined as option, it will not re-create the element, if it exists, but it will set the options to the existing one.

Currently I use this workaroung, it may help to understand

 
    <pre class="highlight">if (isset($c->elements)) {
      foreach ($c->elements as $name => $val) {
        if (isset ($form->{$name})) {
          $form->{$name}->setOptions ($val->options->toArray());
          unset ($c->elements->$name);
        }
      }
      $form->addElements ($c->elements->toArray());
      unset ($c->elements);
    }
    $form->setOptions ($c->toArray());

Following ZF conventions a setConfig() method is supposed to do this. However, I would suggest (to Matthew) to add an addConfig() method too, which obviously shouldn't remove the elements.
