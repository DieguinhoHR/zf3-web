ZF-6797: Please add exception codes to all exceptions in Zend\_Gdata
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It's just not efficient to strstr() on exception messages, in order to figure out what went wrong. An example is when a video was removed from YouTube, you get an exception which says that the service returned 'Video not found, 404' (along those lines), but the exception code is 0. Instead a 404 error code in the exception would be expected and also easier to handle in the application.
