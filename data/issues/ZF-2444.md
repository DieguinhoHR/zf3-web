### Description

Several users have requested the ability to set decorators and filters for form elements en masse:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form->addGlobalDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'div', 'class' => 'foobar'));
    
    $form->addGlobalFilter('StringTrim');


This would simplify setup of the form elements and keep things DRY.
