This is a Fix for the whole Zend\_Form package.

To Matthew Weier O'Phinney @ ZF-6062

Overloading actually works with variables with numeric values, i have a deeply nested setup working with numerical form names.

_Notice for XHTML:_ ID and NAME must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("\_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").

Look here: [<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#id>] [<http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Name>]

Cleaned the patch, found the truly bug within isValid() and isValidPartial() which causes loss of data with SubForms and ElementsBelongTo.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isValid|isValidPartial
    {
    ...
    // This handles BelongsTo and returns in all cases, even without
    // belongsTo Array Notation the data for the current (Sub)Form
    $data = $this->_dissolveArrayValue($data, this->getElementsBelongTo());
    ...
    // Here is the bug which eats SubForm data when descending deeper
    // into $data as this is already done by dissolveArrayValue and will
    // be done in the next cycle as well
    if (isset($data[$key])) {
      $valid = $form->isValid($data[$key]) && $valid;
    }
    ...
    }

This is a bad idea: ??Invalid name provided; must be _unique_ per (Sub)Form??

Example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
        Old price:
        
    
    
        New price:
        


Or

 
    <pre class="highlight">

Kai Uwe the current implementation as found in the source of Zend Framework 1.10.2 simply overwrites your equal named submit buttons without notice.

you do

$form = new Zend\_Form(); $form->addElement('submit','Submit',array('options'=>array('value'=>'red'))); $form->addElement('submit','Submit',array('options'=>array('value'=>'green'))); $form->render();

As result you will get a value="green" submit button, but no red one.

And if its not the correct syntax - hey, it's just an example.

Hi Christian, I know the bug in the current version, but your patch also doesn't solve the problem. Another idea: I think the Zend\_Form class is not the right place. This part is better for decorators (Callback, ViewHelper, ViewScript) and/or the view.

Hi Christian. How can I apply this new fix?

 

 

Posted by Christian Albrecht (alab) on 2010-03-09T15:31:21.000+0000

Hey Sergio on linux console this is done with the patch command. But please be aware that this issue is not even commented yet by core developers.

Refactoring patches and Structure of issue.

 

 

Posted by Christian Albrecht (alab) on 2010-04-05T06:12:42.000+0000

Added a patch so changing Type.

 

 

Posted by Christian Albrecht (alab) on 2010-04-05T06:13:19.000+0000

That was the wrong issue ;P

 

 

Posted by Christian Albrecht (alab) on 2010-04-20T09:31:08.000+0000

Changing Priority since the 'loss of data Issues' are resolved.
