Also I've added :

```

in the begining of Zend.php, so now even if Zend is not in include path then it will be in it :)

Also today I've added anothe method to Zend to araise usability :)

 
    <pre class="highlight">

     *          Zend's core dir if TRUE or absolute if FALSE.
     * @throws  Zend_Exception If given path is not available or incorect.
     * @return  string Performed path to Zend's incubator.
     */
    static public function includeIncubator($pathToIncubator = null, $pathIsRelative = true)
    {
        // If param $pathToIncubator wasn't set, or was set to null then set
        // $pathToIncubator equal to '../incubator' and $pathIsRelative to true.
        if (null === $pathToIncubator) {
           $pathToIncubator = '..' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'incubator';
        }
        // Perform relative path
        if ($pathIsRelative) {
            $pathToIncubator = realpath(dirname(__FILE__)
                             . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR
                             . ltrim($pathToIncubator, '\\/'));
        }
        $pathToIncubator = rtrim($pathToIncubator, '\\/');
        // If path is not valid throws Zend_Exception.
        if (!is_dir($pathToIncubator)) {
            $error = sprintf("Cannot find '%s' path. Seems like this directory "
                             . "is not available or path is incorrect.", $pathToIncubator);
            throw new Zend_Exception($error);
        }
        // Else append Zend's incubator path to 'include_path' environment of PHP
        self::includePath($pathToIncubator);
        // And finally return performed path (for debug purposes)

So now I can use it like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    require_once 'library/zend.php';
    Zend::includeIncubator();
    ?>


PS Sorry for chain-post, but I ddn't found how to edit my first comment.

Nice addition IMHO so that we don't have to use .htaccess or ini\_set but just include "/somewhere/in/the/filesytem/lib/Zend.php" and makes deplyoment easier

I've rewrote those methods (includePath and excludePath) and removed includeIncubator() because it's not necessary anyway... so now I have following lines in my Zend.php [code] <?php // ... skipped ... /\*\* \* Include Zend's core dir to 'include\_path' configuration option. \*/ Zend::includePath(realpath(dirname(**FILE**))); // ... skipped ... final class Zend { // ... skipped ... /\*\* \* Zend::includePath() \* \* Add new path to PHP's 'include\_path' configuration option. \* \* Valid examples of $includePath are: \* $includePath = array('new/path', 'another/new/path'); \* $includePath = 'new/path' .

} [/code]

So now in index.php of my project I have such lines:

[code] /\*\* \* Setting include\_path configuration option \*/ Zend::includePath(array('../incubator/', '../draft/'), true); [/code]

Let us coordinate with Art Hundiak who is working on Zend\_Registry in the incubator. Then we can rollout a tested version of Zend.php with various enhancements at the same time, instead of multiple times.

I can't find how to edit comments so that's why I've decided to edit main post...

            }
            return $pathToCorrect;
        }


So in my project's index.php I have such string, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // include_path is
    // '.:/home/ixti/includes'
    require_once 'lib/Zend.php';
    Zend::includePath(array('/', '../incubator'), true);
    // now include_path is
    // '.:/home/ixti/includes:/home/ixti/includes/lib:/home/ixti/includes/incubator'

Gavin Vess, I don't clearly understood what you are going to do, but if my help or assistance is needed then I'll be glad to assist :)

Anyhow if my code is usefull and you'll include it into Zend, I'll be pleased. :)

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-01-30T15:39:32.000+0000

Various changes have been made to related functions in Zend.php over the last few months. I continue to see value in your functions above, but some rework would be needed. Based on current guidelines from the team, I believe the scope of changes above require a proposal. Recently the ZF team has clearly stated that we need to avoid adding features to the ZF (before ZF 1.0) without properly following the process for proposing new features (i.e. proposals).

In order to proceed, I suggest you submit this as a proposal. The greater visibility of a proposal may also help attract input and contributions from the community. I believe the ideas and functions above have a greater chance of acceptance and adoption by the community, if they are contributed in the scope of a larger effort (a proposal addresses path manipulation utility functions for the ZF).

If you submit a proposal for these functions, please provide several use cases showing the community why and how these functions can be used with the current Zend.php related functions, autoloading, the ZF incubator, etc. These use cases attract community support and suggestions for enhancements :)

Ok. I'll write a proposal as soon as possible.
