### Description

all applications somehow need a user login and profile system and rules for the priviliges for their users. I have been using asp.net since 2003 and membership and tules are ready for me there. but I need to use php in my new project and I like to see that kind ready to use membership and rules and profile system.

actually most of developers use ready systems for their applications and that would be good big plus for the framework.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
