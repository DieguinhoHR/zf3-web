### Description

Hi,

For an unknown reason, this works: print '/_'.json\_encode(array('items'=>$result)).'_/'; but this does not: $this->\_helper->autoCompleteDojo($result);

(yes, the context switching is initialized)

Not enough information to determine what issue the reporter has; my own demos work fine.
