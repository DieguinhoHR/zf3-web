I notice you're using PHP 5.2.0. This error does not occur in 5.1.x as indirect property access using overloading works on references; this particular error occurs because 5.2.0 does not handle it the same way, particularly with arrays.

I'm downgrading the priority as the stated supported PHP version is 5.1.4; however, I will work to get a fix in place.

downgrading to critical from blocker; only affects 5.2.0 at this time.

Fixed in revision 2276. Had to have Zend\_View extend ArrayObject to get access to work properly.
