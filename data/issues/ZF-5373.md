### Description

snippet: - form creation: (Inside a class extending Zend\_Form, defining my form)

$captchaVals = array('none' => 'None','image' => 'Image','recaptcha' => 'Recaptcha') $this->addElement('radio', 'captcha', array('label' => 'Captcha type','multiOptions' => $captchaVals,'separator' => ' ' ));

snippet: form instantiation:

$form = new MyFrm(); $ctctFrm['captcha'] = 'image'; $form->populate($ctctFrm);

The radio buttons are all displayed BUT the 'image' button is not switched on as expected. All other text type fields get populated as expected. If I set the element to type 'select', the populate() function does not set the selected option as expected either.

This means that selections/radio buttons etc are unuseable as a html display types when trying to populate a form. The documentation for Zend\_Form\_Element.. (or indeed in the general Zend\_Form examples) does not mention how to set the correct radio button in a radio group or selection box. The html rendering function for select / radio etc. should check the current value of the element and set the appropriate attribute for the element if the value matches one of its options.
