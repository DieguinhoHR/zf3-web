### Description

When the RewriteRule is defined in Apache config instead of a .htaccess file, $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] doesn't contain a filename and is equal to $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI']. I'm not sure if it is a bug in PHP/Apache tandem or some very weird feature I wasn't aware of.

Reported by two people.

By _JÃ¶rg Sandkuhle_:

{quote} if i use the new RewriteRouter, i get an error

_Warning_: strpos() [function.strpos <<http://develop/function.strpos>>]: Empty delimiter. in\*\* C:\\apache\\xampp\\htdocs\\develop\\libs\\zend\\incubator\\library\\Zend\\Controller\\RewriteRouter.php on line 67

Thats because if i use the url <www.example.com>, the $\_SERVER['SCRIPT\_NAME'] is "/", the basename from "/" is empty.

 
        $base = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];
    
        if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], basename($base)) === false) {
            $base = rtrim(dirname($base), '/');
        }
        $this->_rewriteBase = $base;


If i type <www.example.com/test> everything is ok. {quote}

And by _Matthew Ratzloff_:

{quote} With the pre-rewriteBase RewriteRouter everything worked great for me, but now that the rewriteBase stuff has been added I can't get it to work at all. This is using a version of the router I checked out just a couple hours ago.

Here are some specific errors I'm getting (lines refer to RewriteRouter):

getCurrentRoute() on the root index throws this:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Exception' with message 'Current route is not defined' [...] on line 84

The index page gives a warning:

Warning: strpos() [function.strpos]: Empty delimiter. [...] on line 63

And all routes (/controller/action, controller/action/key/value, special routes defined with addRoute()) default to noRoute. The traditional routes work just fine with the original router.

And I'm not sure if this is how rewriteBase is supposed to work, but getRewriteBase() returns the full web path (minus domain). Manually setting the rewriteBase with setRewriteBase() makes no difference. {quote}
