ZF-11835: Conditional comments functionality missing from Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta

### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.headmeta) describes passing a $conditionalHttpEquiv parameter as a modifier to methods such as appendHttpEquiv. Although there are no code examples for what to pass for headMeta, there are examples in headScript which pass an array of the form ('conditional' => 'lt IE 7'), for example.

Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadMeta::itemToString() does nothing with a conditional key, whereas Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript::itemToString() treats 'conditional' as a special case and wraps the value in a javascript comment.

Attached patch which implements behavior matching that of Zend\_View\_Helper\_HeadScript

I don't think we need the

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    && !empty($item->modifiers['conditional'])


as the isset() will take care of that as well?

Just tested and you're right - we do need the !empty().

Patch looks good to me.
