ZF-2273: Zend\_Config\_Xml cannot handle XML lists
--------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-12-06T04:52:38.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-12-19T02:21:29.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Zend\_Config\_Xml does not correctly handle flat lists. Take the following example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    value1value2

When accessing this XML config with Zend\_Config only the path list->item is there and points to "value2" ("value1" has been overwritten), not list[0]. SimpleXml handles such flat lists completely correct.
