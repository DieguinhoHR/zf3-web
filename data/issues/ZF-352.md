### Description

Instead of:

[foo] prop1 = 'some value'

[bar] extends = foo prop2 = 'some value'

it is proposed that section extension take place in the following way:

[foo] prop1 = 'some value'

[bar : foo] prop2 = 'some value'

Edited a bit to illustrate the proposed change.

Patch v1 essentially converts the

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [X:Y] 
    a = b


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [X]
    extends=Y
    a = b

Fixed in subversion changeset 1282

I did not see a documentation change in the changeset.

I don't have a system where I can compile docbook, so am reluctant to commit documentation changes until I do.

ZF-403 covers documentation updating for 0.2 and I've attached a patch for this issue to it.
