### Description

At present, the HTML5 doctype from Zend\_View\_Helper\_Doctype renders non-closed tags in some circumstances which prevents the use of (X/)HTML5 rendering. By adding an XHTML5 doctype option, one could retain any HTML5 specific support but enforce closing all tags correctly as with any XHTML serialisation. This would allow HTML5 pass the isXhtml() test used by many components including View Helpers.

This patch adds a 'XHTML5' option to the Doctype view helper.
