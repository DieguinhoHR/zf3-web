### Description

There currently is now way to detect within an application if a session has been destroyed with Zend\_Session::destroy() as Zend\_Session::$\_destroyed is declared private and there is no Zend\_Session::isDestroyed() method. A Zend\_Session::isStarted() on a destroyed session still returns TRUE as it isn't reset within Zend\_Session::destroy(). This is bad as there are cases where you destroy a session but later in the code flow want to check if there is a valid, started session. As you can only check or Zend\_Session::isStarted() this leads to the problem that when depending on the result of Zend\_Session::isStarted() any call to Zend\_Session\_Namespace() results in an exception stating that the session has been destroyed and can't be re-started.

Easy workaround this problem: Add a Zend\_Session::isDestroyed() method with the following code to Zend/Session.php:

public static funcion isDestroyed() { return self::$\_destroyed; }
