### Description

It would be nice to have a method in Zend\_Locale\_Format to format names.

Names could be formatted by: \* creating the correct firstname - lastname order \* capitalizing firstname and/or lastname \* ... ?

e.g in France it seems to be common to write names like: SMITH John while in Belgium the rule is: John Smith

Zend\_Locale is based on unicode CLDR. Actually CLDR does not provide data for such a feature.
