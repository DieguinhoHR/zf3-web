### Description

Alot of people don't know about the feature of nested controllers because of the missing documentation, and if you know it you have to try around to get the feature working.

Afaik the feature is included since version 0.6, so adding that to the documentation would maybe be on time :-)

I'm not sure what you mean by "nested controllers"... and I'm the MVC maintainer; "nesting" is not a term I've ever used in relation to Zend\_Controller. If you mean the dispatch loop, and the fact that you can dispatch many actions in the same request, this is fully documented in the Zend\_Controller manual pages. If you're meaning something else, please elaborate.

The ZF offers you the possibility to nest (i dont know how to call it otherwhiste) controllers so your directory structure represents the actual url structure.

A little example, this site structure is possible:

/application + /default + /controllers + /Sub1 + /Sub2 + HelloController.php

If you call the URL [http://domain.com/default/sub1\_sub2\_hello/â€¦](http://www.domain.com/default/sub1_sub2_hello/index) the HelloController.php will be called in the last nested sub directory. The class in the HelloController.php file needs to be "Named Sub1\_Sub2\_HelloController".

I hope its more clear now?

You're talking about the ability to use controllers within subdirectories, and you're right, this is undocumented. I'll try and find some time to do so before the 1.6.0 release.

If you want to call it so, yes i am talking about that :-)
