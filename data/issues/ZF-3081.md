### Description

Hello,

I have found a bug in Imap protocol to append a message to a box. Excuse me for my english, and i hope you will understand what i mean.

Here is an example of a correct APPEND operation :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    . APPEND user.pdupont {152}
    + go ahead
    From:
    To:
    Subject: Les lapins d'Australie
    
    Ne pas les confondre avec les kangourous.
    
    . OK [APPENDUID 896443059 1408] Completed


But in "Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Imap::append", it throw "requestAndResponse", which "\_assumedNextLine" with '+ OK'. But it needs for APPEND '+ go ahead'. So to resume :

send 'APPEND '. $folder .' {'. strlen($message) .'}'; waiting for '+ go ahead' send $message

And of course, could the uid be return when we call $uid = $imap->appendMessage(...) ?

Thanks a lot, Vincent

Thanks. We now don't check for the response text, only for '+ '
