### Description

The testsuite for ZF isn't compatible with PHPUnit 3.5.5 Since we're still using PHPUnit 3.4 for our QA processes, we need to retain 3.4 compatability.

fix in r23508 had 2 issues:

TestHelper.php raised a PHP warning in PHPunit 3.4, and there was a call to PHP\_CodeCoverage\_Filter in tests/Zend/Config/Writer/AllTests.php

These problems are now also fixed in svn r23509
