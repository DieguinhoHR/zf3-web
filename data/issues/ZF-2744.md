We can't use the same privileges for directories as for index files because different meaning of 'x' privileges (list vs execution).

Users can care about index directory privileges by themselves (create directory with right privileges before index creation). That's better way than creating additional API functions for this.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
