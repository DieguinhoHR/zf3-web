### Description

Hi,

I find that ExtJS 4 REST proxy and Zend framework Zend\_Rest\_Route are incompatible. Basically, it is because Ext JS Rest proxy append base url with record ID. Therefore, it causes Zend Framework to route POST request to PUT action. I put detailed report in the following URL.

thanks and regards,

Yiyu Jia

This could be resolved in potentially two ways... 1. Create a custom Zend router that understands Extjs url format.

1. Create a ExtJs Rest proxy that structures the url into the format that Zend requires by default. I have documented this second approach here: [http://techfrere.blogspot.com/2011/08/…](http://techfrere.blogspot.com/2011/08/linking-extjs4-to-zend-using-rest.html)

Hope this helps...

Regards, Mark

Zend\_Rest\_Route should support http:/www.example.com/{module}/{controller}/{idvalue}

So is this making a POST request to a /{idvalue} URL to create a new resource, or append to an existing /{idvalue} resource?
