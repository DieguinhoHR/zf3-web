### Description

TestHelper needs to be included in GdataOnlineTest, CalendarOnlineTest, and SpreadsheetsOnlineTest so that it these tests may be run independently of Zend\_Gdata\_AllTests.

Additional includes will be required as well, since these tests rely on Zend\_Gdata\_AllTests to perform necessary calls to require\_once.

Expanded issue to include all of Zend\_Gdata online tests, with the exception of Zend\_Gdata\_GappsOnlineTest.

Also updated affected versions to include 1.0.1.
