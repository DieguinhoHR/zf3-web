### Description

On the page describing it's use ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.table.relationships.html)) the first arguement to findDependentRowset is described as either the dependent table's model or the string of the model. There is an important difference.

Where the dependent table is held in another database, you must pass in an instance of the model.

When passed in as a string, findDependentRowset assumes the database is that of the row.
