### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene provides access to any of Zend\_Search\_Lucene class by one require once operation:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php';


That provides right require\_once order. It should be described in the documentation.

Zend\_Search\_Lucene doesn't use any special require\_once policy now.

See [ZF-8174] comments and commits.
