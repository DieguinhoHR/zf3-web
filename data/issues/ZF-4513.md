### Description

Currently the mysqli adapter doesn't take in to consideration the mysqli options that can be passed in (<http://us2.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.options.php>).

I feel this can be best achieved using the driver\_options variable and modifying the \_connect() method to handle if there are any driver\_options.

Attached is my first stab at a patch for this.

Version 1.1 of my patch to make it easier to have config options set as strings + the default CONST variables from php.

I also suppress any errors that mysql\_real\_connect might throw and updated the test to see if it is connected or not.

It misses the associated tests before closing the issue

After talking with Ralph we determined that there was not way to test if they are successful or not...

After talking it over with Wil and Ralph again I have came up with a test it was checked in on r13027
