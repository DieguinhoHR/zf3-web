### Description

In the manual ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.functions.html#zend.locale.equals)), a function called isEqual is described.

However, a call to it generates the following error message.

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Zend\_Locale::isEqual() in ...

I had a look in the Locale.php file and found that the current name is equals(). As far as I understand, the manual should be updated or the function renamed.

Docu writer was false... isEquals had never exist.

Fixed the docu with SVN 5071
