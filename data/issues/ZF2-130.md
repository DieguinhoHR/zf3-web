Could you please provide some sample code which reproduces your issue? The Zend\\Validate\\EmailAddress component contains some unit tests which test the MX record-checking functionality, and they pass when I run against master:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [webadmin@spiral tests]$ phpunit --filter MX Zend/Validator/EmailAddressTest
    PHPUnit 3.6.7 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 6.75Mb
    OK (2 tests, 10 assertions)
