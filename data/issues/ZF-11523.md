### Description

Hi,

I have overridden Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable for customization purpose. I also overridden Zend\_Db\_Select to provide bindings/parameterized queries also with 'where' conditions.

Because of the $dbSelect->\_\_toString() (in Zend/Auth/Adapter/DbTable.php@480), my object is not called! So I have to rewrite \_authenticateQuerySelect() method just to remove this strange usage.

I propose this patch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    480c480
    <             $resultIdentities = $this->_zendDb->fetchAll($dbSelect->__toString());
    ---
    >             $resultIdentities = $this->_zendDb->fetchAll($dbSelect);
    


Hope this so simple path will be approved.

Thx a lot for your work on this good framework (it really helps me!), Wilfried

The issue at hand is that the user's superclass of Zend\_Db\_Select binds variables to the query, but these bindings are lost because Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable is cast to a string before being passed to the database adapter. Passing the Zend\_Db\_Select object directly rather than just the SQL string allows Zend\_Db\_Adapter::query to pull the bound variables and use them to execute the statement.
