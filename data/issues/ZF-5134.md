ZF-5134: Create "Checked" validator for ZFE\_Checkbox
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

I discussed it with Matthew on IRC, we agreed that there is no clean way to validate that checkbox was checked. For example "required" flag has no meaning for this element, as it always have value due to its implementation in ZF.

Issue is related to ZF-5122.

No comment. But I can't just add a new component.

Each new component needs to have a proposal, and it needs a little bit of time until I finished it. I added 2 new filter proposals in the last days, but there are still about 5-10 open issues which have to be written as proposal.

As you may imagine, this is a lot of work. So please be patience until I finished all of them.

Note: I am no employee but do this in my sparetime. :-)

I don't think that there is need for a new validator. It seems to me that the following is a valid solution: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5325> {quote}Checking for required on Zend\_Form\_Element\_Checkbox using notEmpty does not make any sense, in my opinion. "Required" for a checkbox should be defined as the fact that the checkbox was checked; Not that the value is not empty.{quote}
