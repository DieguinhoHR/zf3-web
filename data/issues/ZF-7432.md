I have attempted to reproduce, but cannot. I am using mysql 5.0.51a-log, updating a field that is defined by tinyint(1).

Without more details, and the specifics of your database, its hard to determine what is going wrong. I have a feeling though, that the problem you are experiencing is not Zend\_Db related, but is database and/or scheam specific.

If you have more details, feel free to reopen.

Thanks, Ralph

I will post my table sql

CREATE TABLE `pepsi_ecards_images` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto\_increment, `user_id` int(11) default '0', `filename` varchar(255) default NULL, `moderate` tinyint(1) default '0', `created_at` datetime default NULL, `from_country` varchar(3) default NULL, `from` tinyint(4) default '0', PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO\_INCREMENT=51 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

Sorry, still cannot reproduce. I added a record (with id 51 as expected) to your schema you provided, and ran this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('Pdo_Mysql', array('username' => 'developer', 'dbname' => 'test', 'password' => 'developer'));
    Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db);
    
    $table = new Zend_Db_Table('pepsi_ecards_images');
    
    $table->update(array('moderate' => 4), 'id = 51');
    var_dump($table->fetchAll()->toArray());


After checking the database, i can see the value that i provided.

The problem persists, after many tests, i put my sqls in a logfile and see that the value dont is inserter the SQL persists with "?" when i put new

$data = array( 'moderate' => new Zend\_Db\_Expr("2") );

the sql is correct but the value dont change in DB

I create a file only to execute this sabe SQl and it works, my conclusin is the problem is witch zend framework.

this is my code of my file that wworks

 <?php error\_reporting(E\_ALL); $banco = new PDO('mysql:host=XXXXXX;dbname=XXXXXX, 'pepsimundo\_web','XXXXX'); $dados = array(5,52); $r = $banco->prepare('UPDATE `pepsi\_ecards\_images` SET `moderate` = ? WHERE (id = ?)')->execute($dados); var\_dump($r); ?>

If this would indeed proof to be an issue within ZF, a lot of people would have this problem (which is not the case). That by itself makes me believe it's /not/ a bug in ZF (besides, noone seems to be able to reproduce). So you really need to do some debugging here (it's probably something very simple).

Nope, doesn't work. Here is my code:

// this is my model where I trying to update column in mysql which is type tinyint, class Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract { public function updateRow($data, $id) { $this->update($data, array('id = ?' => $id) ); } } // so $data = array('is\_active'=>1)

when I try to update column in db my model function updateRow(...) doesnt work, but if I write my model in this way

class Application\_Model\_DbTable\_Users extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract { public function updateRow($data, $id) { $this->update($data, "id = $id")); } }

It works ??

Any idea?
