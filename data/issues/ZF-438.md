### Description

In ZF\_Incubator the new Zend\_Rest\_Client uses a non-existing class which causes a fatal error (see the message below):

Warning: require\_once(Zend/WebService/Client/Abstract.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in c:\\library\\Zend\\Rest\\Client.php on line 26

Fatal error: require\_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'Zend/WebService/Client/Abstract.php'

Zend\_WebService doesn't exist (yet), Zend\_Service doesn't have am abstract Client class.

Fixed in revision 1412, which was actually back in October 29. Which means it was fixed as of Zend Framework preview release 0.2.0.
