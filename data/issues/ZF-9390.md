### Description

Hi,

The Zend\_Log factory method should use

$log = new self();

instead of

$log = new Zend\_Log();

to create the log instance, so it would be possible to extend Zend\_Log without extending the factory method.

Nope,

why $log = new Zend\_Log(); ?

It should be

$log = new static;

So it ist possible to do something like that;

My\_Log extends Zend\_Log

public function log(...) {}

With new Zend\_Log, there is no chance to extend log()

appendix: in this case ther is no need to override factory-method, this is what i meant with no chance...
