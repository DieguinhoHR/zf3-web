### Description

As reported by Rafael Hengles:

I had a problem sending mails through a Microsoft ESMTP server, and I discovered that on the RSET command, it returned 220 instead of the expected by ZF, 250. I hacked it to "$this->\_expect(array(250,220));" and now it works. Anybody knows a better solution or why does this happen?
