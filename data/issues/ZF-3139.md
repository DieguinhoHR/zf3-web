ZF-3139: Consumer doesn't handle 1.1 delegation properly.
---------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In 1.1 OpenId (livejournal and myopenid.net are examples) delegation must be handled outside of the claimed\_id which comes back as the id of the provider rather than the actual openid. To get around this, we've had to use $\_SESSION to store the original identifier entered by the user.

After verify() returns true, we check If the original identifier doesn't match the claimed id. If it doesn't, we re-perform discovery on it. If the claimed\_id matches the realId of the original identifier, then we assume that it really is verified.

Otherwise, we use the claimed id.

It would be optimal if the claimed\_id that came out of verify() was already based on that process. But it would require the use $\_SESSION to do so.

This bug must be already fixed in SVN trunk. Could you please verify it and close the bug in case of success.

Yeah, sorry, I didn't look at recent fixes before submitting this set of bugs, sorry.

This is a dupe, and it appears fixed in SVN. I can't really test, because we're about to launch and I don't have a good test bed right now.

No problem, just reopen the bug if it doesn't work for you or open a new one but add a test case. Anyway, thank you very much for your reports.
