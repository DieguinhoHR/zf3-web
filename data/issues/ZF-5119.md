### Description

Hi,

a public function getAdapter() in Zend\_Db\_Statement would be nice to get the Zend\_Db\_Adapter from a Zend\_Db\_Statement.

In my case I want to describe the statement with the getColumnMeta() from the adapter (PDO). But my class only know the statement. So I can't determine/access the adapter and in consequence can't retrieve the metadata.

thx
