### Description

In this issue: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5260> functionality for memcache weight, timeout, retry\_interval and status were added. Now we are running memcache on a Debian 4.0 with PHP memcache extension 2.0.1. In this version the extension only allows 6 parameters and throws an ErrorException if you use more. As you see, the affected field is the 'status' field in the addServer function. As I did not see how to get the version of the php extension, i created the following patch which is working fine for me. It also should not affect newer versions of the extension, because the default setting in the php extension is true, just like Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Memcached does.

I just commited a "compatibility" option into SVN trunk to deal with that kind of problems

For the moment, this option controls only the status parameter like you describe it here.

Many thanks
