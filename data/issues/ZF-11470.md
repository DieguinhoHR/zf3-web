### Description

InfoCard's XmlParsingTest has below's code.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     public function testKeyInfo() {
        try {
            Zend_InfoCard_Xml_KeyInfo::getInstance("");
            $this->fail("Expected Exception Not thrown"); 
        } catch(Exception $e) {
         /* yay */
        }


Zend\_InfoCard\_Xml\_KeyInfo::getInstance() method will not throw Exception, if string is as argument?

Please evaluate this above testcase. Is "" valid for KeyInfo?(sorry, I can't judge.)

If "" is valid ,please write assert-testcase for "", and write remove failmethod above.

The method actually checks for an XML DSig namespace in the given XML string later on and throws an Exception if not found. The test description sucks, but I think that's what it's verifying. Marking as a non-issue as a result.

Thanks for taking the time to report it though!
