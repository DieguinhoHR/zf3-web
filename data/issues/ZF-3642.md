### Description

Set up a small benchmark to check performance between InnoDB and ARCHIVE storage engine of mysql. Used [example](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.profiler.html#zend.db.profiler.using) from manual to output results. Here the results:

 
    <pre class="highlight">             Executed: 15 queries in 0.59294509887695 seconds
     Average query length: 0.039529673258464 seconds
       Queries per second: 25.297451700689
     Longest query length: 0.28680014610291
            Longest query: SELECT * FROM history LIMIT 50000

 
    <pre class="highlight">             Executed: 14 queries in 1.0089721679688 seconds
     Average query length: 0.072069440569196 seconds
       Queries per second: 13.875506623919
     Longest query length: 0.48813700675964
            Longest query: SELECT * FROM history_072008 LIMIT 50000

There you can see that the first result contains 15 queries, the second result only 14. There should be only 14, so I think this is because of an initial sql query that will be executed before the first application based query will be executed. So I am forced to execute one senseless query to get correct count of queries.

Attached benchmark (archive\_bench.php).

Oh sorry, IÂ´ve attached a file where I already "fixed" my results. Please ignore lines 13 and 14.

If you invert your tables, it's the same.

The first count include the 'connect' query. This query is of course erased by your lines 13 & 14.

Try this to see:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        foreach ($oProfiler->getQueryProfiles() as $oQuery)
        {
            if ($oQuery->getElapsedSecs() > $iLongestTime)
            {
                $iLongestTime  = $oQuery->getElapsedSecs();
                $iLongestQuery = $oQuery->getQuery();
            }
            echo $oQuery->getQuery() . "\n";
        }


My result with your code (on very small table):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                 Executed: 15 queries in 0.0053527355194092 seconds
     Average query length: 0.00035684903462728 seconds
       Queries per second: 2802.3054652354
     Longest query length: 0.0035429000854492
            Longest query: connect
    
                 Executed: 14 queries in 2.0547692775726 seconds
     Average query length: 0.14676923411233 seconds
       Queries per second: 6.8134170355801
     Longest query length: 0.2819390296936
            Longest query: SELECT * FROM tableau_planning LIMIT 7500
