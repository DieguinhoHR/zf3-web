### Description

It would be beneficial if _Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route_ accepted _Zend\_Validate_ as a requirement.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validate = new Zend_Validate_Db_RecordExists(
        array(
            'table' => 'account',
            'field' => 'name'
        )
    );
    
    $route = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Validate(
        ':accountname/:action/*',
        array(
            'module' => 'default',
            'controller' => 'account',
            'action' => 'index'
        ),
        array(
            'accountname' => $validate // string (for regex) or Zend_Validate
        )
    );


In case of someone else would also be interested in to pass Zend\_Validate as a requirement for their routes, I will contribute my extended Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route to support this.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class Kblom_Controller_Router_Route_Validate
        extends Zend_Controller_Router_Route
    {
        public function match($path, $partial = false)
        {
            $ppath = $path;
    
            if (!$partial) {
                $path = trim($path, $this->_urlDelimiter);
            }
            $path = explode($this->_urlDelimiter, $path);
    
            foreach ($this->_parts as $pos => $part) {
                if ($part instanceof Zend_Validate_Abstract) {
                    if (!$part->isValid($path[$pos])) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    $this->_parts[$pos] = null;
                }
            }
    
            return parent::match($ppath, $partial);
        }
    }

As Freeaqingme said, it will slow down application performance in general. And, I think that you can write a plugin controller to validate the route in the method preDispatch().

For your use case, I think that a bad design. You should validate your parameters in a service layout, in a mapper, or in your model. Throw an exception for username not found. After, you can catch this exception in your action in order to switch in a Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Exception with 404 code. You can inject your exception as previous exception in the constructor, because Zend\_Exception emulate this feature for PHP 5.2 if you don't use PHP 5.3. And, you have a HTTP error 404.

With your design, you have an exception 'No route matched the request'. I think that your use case is really an invalid argument ...

So, I suggest to resolve the issue with status "Won't fix".

Well I agree that the example use case I made up is bad in general. Actually I came up with this validator idea when I need a reverse match regex requirement (which regex does not support).

In my opinion it would be logical that routes support validators, but however, if it does not fit in ZF I do not complain.
