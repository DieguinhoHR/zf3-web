### Description

Zend\_Gdata\_AuthSub::getHttpClient allows passing of vanilla Zend\_Http\_Client instance, but then attempts to call setAuthSubToken() method on it, resulting in unhandled fatal error.

Reproduce (Zend\_Gdata\_AuthSubTest.php):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setUri('<a href="http://example.com/AuthSub">http://example.com/AuthSub</a>');
    $gdclient = Zend_Gdata_AuthSub::getHttpClient('FakeToken', $client);


Result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method Zend_Http_Client::setAuthSubToken() in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/lib/zfdev/trunk/library/Zend/Gdata/AuthSub.php on line 242

Attached patch with possible fix. This avenue does technically break backwards-compatibility as you can no longer pass vanilla Zend\_Http\_Client instances into Zend\_Gdata\_AuthSub, however doing so before raised a fatal error in PHP, so IMHO I don't think that BC break is an issue.

Comments?

Looks good to me.

You have a commit bit, correct? Let me know if you need any further assistance with this.
