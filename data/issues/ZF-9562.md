ZF-9562: Zend Lucene displays blank screen when no results found
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When I submit a query to Zend\_Lucene with a string that exists in the index, the results are displayed as expected, however when string is not found, I get a blank page with no error messages. Code used as below:

 
    require_once 'Zend/Feed.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php';
    $index = Zend_Search_Lucene::open('data/my-index');
    $queryStr = 'fjkhsdkdfh';
    $hits = $index->find($queryStr);
    
    if ($hits) {
    
    foreach ($hits as $hit) { 
       echo $hit->page_title;
    }
    
    } else {
    
    echo 'No results found.';
    
    }


I would expect 'No results found' to appear, but instead I get a blank page with no error messages.

What confuses me more is that I have this tested and working locally, but when on a live server it stops working.

Locally I have Zend Server 4 installed, remotely PHP 5.2.11 and ZF 1.10.2

I've also posted this here:

and tried the suggested idea of casting to a string.

After reading your forum post, it seems that you resolved this problem as a local issue, and not a ZF issue.

From what you described, it appears that you simply had a php error due to the required files, and probably this was an issue with redeclaring a class or similar.

I am closing this as a non-issue.
