$this->helper->htmlList($items, false, false, false) call resault is actually correct.

It seems some problems are caused by array\_walk\_recursive() used to test this result.

array\_walk\_recursive() also produces segmentation fault in some cases.

The problem is actuall caused during user function callback. Third parameter contains garbage in some cases.

Fixed with some commit (not reproduced now, r18818).
