### Description

Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\* currently uses string concatenation to build XML. This can lead to encoding issues, particularly when using utf-8 charsets.

If Zend\_XmlRpc\_Value\_String can use htmlentities to encode strings to ISO-8859-1, PHP's DOM layer can build well-formed XML that can be UTF-8 safe.
