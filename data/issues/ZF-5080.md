### Description

It is essential that the ZF documentation provide a full drill-down interface to explore the classes supported within each package, if you could support exactly what the web based Java API provides that would be excellent; but something similar would be a fantastic improvement on the current API docs.

As a chief architect in my current position and former chief architect in a Java environment, I find the documentation for ZF woefully lacking. An engineer should be able to quickly drill-down through the API package they are interested in to determine what classes and functions are relevant to the task at hand and how to use them.

Why is this critiall? My developers are wasting hours trying to figure out exactly what features are supported in the current releases. For example, we know there are many cool dojo view helpers available in the 1.6 release, however finding clear documentation on exactly what features are available and how to use them is nearly impossible. I am certain that thousands of other developers are experiencing the same degradation of performance due to this failure to properly document the code-base.

In my honest opinion, you should make this as a priority over any new/additional development. It is pointless to go careening about developing new functionality when you have no way of conveying your functionality clearly and concisely to the consumers of your product.

It is always far more fun to develop new functionality, but if ZF is to become an acceptable API for enterprise level application development it must take a more disciplined approach. For example, we recently ran into a situation where the code on one developer's machine did not work on the other's, even though they were all running the 1.6.x version of ZF. After wasting hours of time for several developers (how much has/will this cost all users of ZF, certainly on the order of thousands for us, perhaps millions for all ZF customers?), it was revealed that the Zend\_Auth \_\_construct method had been changed from private to protected between the 1.6.1 and 1.6.2. Not an acceptable change for a patch release within a minor revision, and something that should be very clearly documented in a new major release as it could break a LOT of code.

Can you supply a link for what you have in mind? If you are talking about the generated Javadocs for Java, we do have this: <http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/>. I have also been requiring contributors to follow our release policy strictly, but unfortunately we don't catch everything.

I'm postponing this issue until we hear back from the reporter.
