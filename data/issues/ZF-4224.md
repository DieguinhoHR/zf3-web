### Description

It would be really great if there would be the possibility to get the results of fetchAll() not only as a continous array but indexed by one of the columns of the result. That means having a table with two columns country\_id and country\_name for example it would be great to make a call like fetchAll(..., 'country\_id') and get an array like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1 => 'country_1',
    2 => 'country_2',
    ...


or even

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1 => array(
                        country_id => 1,
                        country_name => 'country_1',
                      ),
    2 => array(
                        country_id => 2,
                        country_name => 'country_2',
                      ),

This functionality already exists. Try using fetchAssoc().

Although, I agree, documentation should be better.
