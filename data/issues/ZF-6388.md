### Description

It would be nice to have support for multiple namespaces in Zend\_Soap\_Server. I've tried to use 2 setClass with different namespace and only the latest is available. Might is a problem of the php5 extension ?

$options=null; $server = new Zend\_Soap\_Server("http://127.0.0.1/services/soap?wsdl", $options); $server->setClass('Ldap\_Services','ldap'); $server->setClass('Catv\_Services','catv'); $server->handle(); ...

That is correct.

Multiple classes or objects cannot be handled.

You have to build a facade that proxies to both classes.
