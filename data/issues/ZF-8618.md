### Description

Zend\_Json\_Decoder (the native alternative to ext/json) returns types which are incompatible with ext/json, thus for the same JSON input ext/json may emit a stdClass object whereas Zend\_Json\_Decoder emits an Array instead. Given the access differences this incompatibility may break applications moving from an ext/json system to one (e.g. CentOS) where ext/json is not available and Zend\_Json\_Decoder is utilised instead.

Reproduce code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">'));
    var_dump(Zend_Json_Decoder::decode('{"zero": 2}'));

Expected:

object(stdClass)#1 (1) { ["zero"]=> int(2) } object(stdClass)#1 (1) { ["zero"]=> int(2) }

Actual:

object(stdClass)#1 (1) { ["zero"]=> int(2) } array(1) { ["zero"]=> int(2) }

you must pass the second parameter of the function.

var\_dump(Zend\_Json\_Decoder::decode('{"zero": 2}',TYPE\_OBJECT));

ext/json doesn't require the extra parameter - so it is an incompatible behaviour ;).

json\_decode defaults to returning an object of type stdClass, but Zend\_Json::decode defaults to returning an array whether it uses json\_decode or its own internal decoder. I can see how this is confusing and inconsistent. However, if we change the default behavior, wouldn't that break backwards compatibility? This behavior has been in place since they added support for ext/json. Thoughts?

Perhaps in ZF2 the default could change? I can't see a way to change the default behavior without breaking backwards compatibility.
