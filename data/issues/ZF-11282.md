### Description

When I was testing my LDAP authentication method realized that the "bind ()" was not returning error message then added at the beginning and end of a "try""catch" with only "exception". Eg: try { . . } catch (Exception $ e) { echo $ e-> getMessage (); exit (); }

Note: Please try to fix this problem and return for the next version of Zend\_Ldap.

This is the expected behavior of Zend\_Ldap. If Zend\_Ldap::bind() fails to bind, it throws an exception of type Zend\_Ldap\_Exception. The examples on the documentation pages don't do it, but you're Zend\_Ldap code should look like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ldap = new Zend_Ldap($options);
    try {
        $ldap->bind();
        [...your LDAP actions here...]
    } catch ( Zend_Ldap_Exception $e ) {
        [...handle case where LDAP can't connect...]
    }


The unit tests in Zend\_Ldap\_BindTest do this as well. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testEmptyOptionsBind()
    {
        $ldap = new Zend_Ldap(array());
        try {
            $ldap->bind();
            $this->fail('Expected exception for empty options');
        } catch (Zend_Ldap_Exception $zle) {
            $this->assertContains('A host parameter is required', $zle->getMessage());
        }
    }

Well, this occurred when the LDAP server was not returned information or took too long to return, I believe that the library was a mistake to delay this because, simply stop the process of research and class error "LDAP exception" did not return anything but null.

My resolution of the problem was put in the search method from the library the output to 'catch (Exception) "and so get the exception error in communication.

As this error was not provided an instability in our LDAP servers do not believe I need to roast our brains to solving a complex.

I used google translate to translate this text, sorry.
