### Description

Problem:

Rendering a Zend\_Form in a dojo enabled view adds the following javascript to addOnLoad:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    dojo.forEach(zendDijits, function(info) {
            var n = dojo.byId(info.id);
            if (null != n) {
                dojo.attr(n, dojo.mixin({ id: info.id }, info.params));
            }
        });
        dojo.parser.parse();


If dojo is set to parseOnLoad, then all dojo widgets get parsed twice, throwing exceptions like the following: "Tried to register widget with id==widgetId but that id is already registered";

Solution:

The offending line is dojo.parser.parse(); which parses the entire DOM. Only the zendDijits in the foreach should be parsed.

Patch:

Lines 778 - 797 in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo\_Container.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function registerDijitLoader()
        {
            if (!$this->_dijitLoaderRegistered) {
                $js =<<requireModule('dojo.parser');
                $this->prependOnLoad($js);
                $this->addJavascript('var zendDijits = ' . $this->dijitsToJson() . ';');
                $this->_dijitLoaderRegistered = true;
            }
        }

The proposed patch does not quite work.

While it appears to solve the problem, for some reason it does not parse the actual form element as a dijit. Thus, for a form like

 if you use the patch, then dijit.byId('someID'); is undefined (whereas dojo.byId('someID) returns the form object). This prevents you doing many interesting things with the form object, such as validating it and passing it to the xhr\* functions.

However, a workaround seems to be using the declarative form of Dojo rather than the programmatic by calling Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Dojo::setUseDeclarative();

This excludes the troublesome dojo.parser.parse(); entirely, and therefore solves the problem.

dojo.parser.parse() should be provided the parent element of one or more elements that it should parse; you cannot point it to the element itself.

The easy solution to this is: don't set the parseOnLoad djConfig value to true manually when using ZF. When we do programmatic execution, dojo.parser.parse() will be called for you during an onLoad event; when we do declarative, the parseOnLoad djConfig option will be set for you.
