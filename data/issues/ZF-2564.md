### Description

Currently, addElement() returns the Zend\_Form object, which makes creating and returning a new element in a single step non-intuitive:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = $form->addElement('text', 'foo')->foo;


Please add a createElement() method that mimics addElement() but instead returns the element itself.

Added in r7822. addElement() now calls this internally when creating elements as a factory as well.
