ZF-5663: Statement doesn't get deallocated after preparation and execution

### Description

Hello

In a relatively large transaction using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql the PostgreSQL Database suddenly (and somewhat randomly) terminates this transaction with the error:

ERROR: 42P05: prepared statement "pdo\_pgsql\_stmt\_0a0d3ba8" already exists

Based on a quick look at "prepare.c" (in the PostgreSQL source code), the presence of the prepared statement is checked by its name and not its post-parse-analysis tree. I assume the name is set by PDO and is in this special case "pdo\_pgsql\_stmt\_0a0d3ba8". Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I think the problem relies in Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php, e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $stmt = $this->query($sql, $bind);
            $result = $stmt->fetchAll($fetchMode);
            return $result;


Here this $stmt is not cleared after execution and in the case of a large transaction the statement relies in a prepared state in the database. I think this sometimes gets garbage collected by php, but as it seems not at the right time. In a method like "fetchAll(...)" or "fetchOne(...)" or similar "one-shot" methods, this statement can't be reused. In this case a prepared statement doesn't make sense, but this is discussed in [another report](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1398) already.

Isn't it a bad idea not to close a resource which isn't reused later in the code?

Either I'm totally wrong and royally fucked up my database or this is really a problem with Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql and/or PDO. But I think not closing a resource which is not used in the later process is bad practice and should be fixed.

Could someone shed a little more light on this? This would be great :)

PostgreSQL Version:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT version();
                                              version                                           
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PostgreSQL 8.3.5 on i486-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by GCC gcc-4.3.real (Debian 4.3.2-1) 4.3.2
    (1 row)


Please tell me if you need more information about this problem (exact statements, php version, phpinfo() ...). Thx.
