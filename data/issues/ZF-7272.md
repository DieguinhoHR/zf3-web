### Description

ZF-6748 issued a patch that causes an exception to be thrown when a seek to an out-of-bounds index occurs. Unfortunately, this has caused a side-effect: calling getRow() after iterating through a rowset causes an exception, because after iterating, the value of $this->\_pointer is length + 1, and getRow tries to set it back to length + 1 after seeking and fetching the row.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $table = new Zend_Db_Table($config);
    $rowset = $table->fetchAll($table->select()->limit(3)); // $rowset->_pointer is 0
    foreach($rowset as $row) {} // $rowset->_pointer is now 3
    $rowset->getRow(0); // exception


Instead of calling $this->seek($key);, getRow should just set the pointer directly:

 
    <pre class="highlight">

    +            $this->_pointer = $key;
             }
             return $row;
         }

We encountered this regression when upgrading from 1.5 to 1.9. This patch has fixed it for us.

This was fixed along with ZF-8486.

If you feel there is still an issue, please reopen.
