### Description

Hi all. I use Zend\_Mail in order to read POP3 messages, extracting parts from multipart mails.

But in a particular mail (a confirm mail I received from voila.fr website), 'boundary' value is described like this :

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary = bc34b90a236c267d1df0a9163df115a3b

There is a whitespace between '=' and the boundary value, so (I think) Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitMessageStruct() doesn't parse boundary lines correctly. I used the trim function on $boundary (in Zend\_Mail\_Part::\_cacheContent), and it works, parts are well extracted, but it's a temporary solution.

Is there a bug in Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitHeaderField(), Is this method too RFC-strict ? I'm a beginner so I'm not sure. :)

Edit : this issue is similar to [ZF-3318 issue](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3318). Sorry, this one can be removed.
