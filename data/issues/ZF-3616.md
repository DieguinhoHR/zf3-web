Hello Evgeny could you please check if the incubator cURL Adapter now supports your use case? (framework.zend.com/svn/incubator/library/Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Curl.php

It does not need changes to the Client and Response classes and you should set $config['curlopts'] with the the specific proxy options you need for the Proxy behaviour. Feedback is greatly appreciated.

cURL Adapter moved to trunk, ready to be released in 1.8
