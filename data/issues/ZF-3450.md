ZF-3450: LDAP won't work on a default Zend Core installation

### Description

The current documentation for Zend\_Auth relating to LDAP and for Zend\_Ldap both fail to mention that you need to have the ldap extension compiled into PHP. The Zend Core distribution does not install ldap support. According to the PHP guide at <http://uk.php.net/manual/en/ldap.installation.php> it needs to be compiled in. This effectively makes ldap usage unavailable for Zend Core (and most standard php) installations. At a minimum the documentation for Framework needs to mention this caveat.

This information is kept in the requirements appendix. I've added the dependency with r12847.
