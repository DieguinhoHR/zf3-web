ZF-9506: Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php: Error on cache clean with hashed\_directory\_level > 0 when at least one subdir is empty

### Description

Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php:803

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((is_dir($file)) and ($this->_options['hashed_directory_level']>0)) {
         // Recursive call
         $result = array_unique(array_merge($result, $this->_get($file . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $mode, $tags)));
    }


If the directory $file is empty then this:

line 741

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($glob === false) {
         return true;
    }


will return true and

line 808

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array_unique($result);


will turn it to false (true or false does not matter) - problem is that this is NOT an array.

So next "array\_merge()" will start a cascade of errors for each recursive call.

Warning: array\_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #2 is not an array in /var/www/libraries/ZendFramework-1.10.0-minimal/library/Zend/Cache/Backend/File.php on line 805

Maybe there is a better solution, but this seems to work fine for me:

line 803

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((is_dir($file)) and ($this->_options['hashed_directory_level']>0)) {
        // Recursive call
        $tmp_result = $this->_get($file . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $mode, $tags);
        if (is_array($tmp_result)) {
            $result = array_unique(array_merge($result, $tmp_result));
        }
    }


Best regards, Anton

just a code styling change to understand this issue

I did some small changes in trunk on r21636.

The failure isn't on clean - it's on get\*. I don't know how I can write a test for it because the failure only generates if glob returns false. Normally glob retuns an empty array but a note on php.net says: {quote} On some systems it is impossible to distinguish between empty match and an error. {quote}

Can you please test it.

You are right, it's on \_get! Triggered by "clean" which sometimes makes one directory empty.

I have copied you changed File.php and will test tomorrow as I can't do today.

Cheers, Anton

Thanks for testing Anton.
