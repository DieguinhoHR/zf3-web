### Description

If you go look at the documentation for Zend\_View\_Helper\_Partial ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.partial)) you will notice it's missing how to use the helper when you have an object array with methods you want to access.

Ex :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->partialLoop()->setObjectKey('object')->partialLoop('_loop.phtml', $this->myobject);

Jon, is this something you can cover yourself?
