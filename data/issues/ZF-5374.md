ZF-5374: bcmath doesn't handle numbers in exponential notation
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-12-29T11:07:41.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-01-03T05:33:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Try this :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $unit = new Zend_Measure_Pressure(1, Zend_Measure_Pressure::KILOBAR);
    $unit->setType(Zend_Measure_Pressure::STANDARD);
    echo $unit->toString();


It should display 100000000.0000000000000000000000000 N/m², but it displays 0.

I think it's because bcmath doesn't handle numbers in exponential notation. If you look in Zend\_Measure\_Pressure, you can see that '1.0e+8' is set for KILOBAR factor. bcmath doesn't recognize the 'e+8', so it multiplies the value by 0. Obviously, it's like this everywhere.

One workaround is to remove the quote and use a float, or better write the factors expanded : 100000000 instead of 1.0e+8.

bcmath is a php extension and not related to ZF. This is not a issue of ZF.

If you apply my patch of Zend\_Locale\_Math::normalize (see [[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/…](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-2878%7CZF-2878)]) and use it in Zend\_Measure\_Abstract::setType, the problem is resolved (unless you don't use bcmath, because I use bcmul and bcpow).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $value = call_user_func(Zend_Locale_Math::$mul, $value, Zend_Locale_Math::normalize($this->_units[$this->getType()][0]), 25);

Issues of php itself of it's extensions can't be solved by ZF. Therefor this issue will be closed.
