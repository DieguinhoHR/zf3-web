### Description

Issue reported by Jim Scherer.

Below is code to demonstrate the failure:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Loader.php';
    Zend_Loader::registerAutoload();
    
    $filters = array( );
    
    $validators = array(
        'test' => array(
            'allowEmpty' => false,
            'fields' => array( 'empty', 'notempty' )
        )
    );
    
    $data = array(
        'empty' => '',
        'notempty' => 'not empty'
    );
    
    $input = new Zend_Filter_Input( $filters, $validators, $data );
    
    // expect input to be invalid
    echo "\ninput->isValid =\n";
    var_dump($input->isValid());
    
    echo "\nvalidators =\n";
    var_dump($validators);
    
    // echo "\ninput object =\n";
    // echo var_dump($input);
    
    echo "\nempty(data[empty]) =\n";
    var_dump(empty($data['empty']));
    
    echo "\nempty(data[notempty]) =\n";
    var_dump(empty($data['notempty']));

Confirmed that isValid() returns true, which is wrong for the example case above.

Changing to 'Unassigned'

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

I will spend some time on it later this week.

Running the above code on actual trunk I get the expected and wished result. Closing this issue as fixed for the next release as I'm unsure when it was really fixed.
