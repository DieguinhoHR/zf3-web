ZF-4613: Passing a Zend\_Db\_Select Object to Zend\_Paginator when using Oracle results in an Error

### Description

When using Zend\_Paginator in Conjunction with a Zend\_Db\_Select Object on Oracle, an E\_NOTICE is raised in Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect.

Output:

 
    <pre class="literal">
     Notice: Undefined index: zend_paginator_row_count in C:\Web\lib\Zend\Paginator\Adapter\DbSelect.php on line 107


This happens when the Adapter attempts to retrieve the ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN from the result array. The column name is defined in lower case, however Oracles default behavior is to return all column names in upper case, unless you explicitly wrap the column alias name in double quotes.

Possible fixes for this might be: 1. In Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect change value declared for ROW\_COUNT\_COLUMN to an upper case string. 2. Check that the array key exists in lower case, and if not use the upper case equivalent on line 107 of Zend\_Paginator\_Adapter\_DbSelect 3. Change line 165 to wrap the column name in quotes. This would then change from:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $expression = new Zend_Db_Expr($countPart . ' AS ' . self::ROW_COUNT_COLUMN); 


to:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    $expression = new Zend_Db_Expr($countPart . ' AS "' . self::ROW_COUNT_COLUMN . '"');

The fix for this will be option 3, but it should use quoteIdentifier() instead in the interest of portability.

This cannot be considered completely resolved until there is a corresponding unit test.

All Zend\_Paginator\_DbSelect and Zend\_Paginator\_DbTableSelect are written for Oracle ([SVN12285](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=12285))
