ZF-7237: Wildcard data (captured by \*) is not reset in unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I will start by an example:

Suppouse you have a route defined as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->addRoute('name', new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
        'list/*', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'list')
    ));


The interesting point is the presence of the \* in the route.

The first time I dispatch to this route from my test everything works fine.

Then I call $this->resetRequest() (in the unit test).

If I dispatch a second time to the same route, but with different wildcard data - it is not parsed.

I managed to track the problem to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route, line 240:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    240: if (!isset($this->_wildcardData[$var]) && !isset($this->_defaults[$var]) && !isset($values[$var])) {
    241:     $this->_wildcardData[$var] = (isset($path[$i+1])) ? urldecode($path[$i+1]) : null;
    242: }


The problem is that this wildcard data stays here from the first request and because of the check above the new data is simply ignored.

I've found a solution to recreate the router and stick it into the front controller, but it seems ugly.

Using trunk@16613!
