### Description

Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect does not allow optgroup elements to have an id attribute. Here is a patch that should allow for the following use case but should still be backwards compatible. This is not necessarily the best way to do this and could probably be a lot better: I put it together very quickly. The existing code doesn't seem to follow the Zend Framework coding standards so I kept my new code similar to the code that's already there. Again, this could be a lot more extensible than it is (e.g. it only allows for id and not class or other arbitrary decorators).

Here is the desired output:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Option AOption BOption COption D

Here is the use case that will give the desired output (with the patch applied):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $optgroupTest = new Zend_Form_Element_Select('optgroup_test');
    $options = array (
        array(
            'id'    => 'option_group_1',
            'label' => 'Option Group 1',
            'options' => array (
                'A'     => 'Option A',
                'B'     => 'Option B',
                'C'     => 'Option C',
            ),
        ),
        array(
            'id'    => 'option_group_2',
            'label' => 'Option Group 2',
            'options' => array (
                'D'     => 'Option D',
            ),
        ),
    );
    $optgroupTest
        ->setLabel('Optgroup Test')
        ->addMultiOptions(
            $options
        )
    ;

I just found one problem with this patch. It breaks the In Array Validator on the Zend\_Form\_Element\_Select. I've temporarily worked around this by calling setRegisterInArrayValidator(false) and manually adding my own In Array Validator with a haystack array that is in the format it likes. However, this is obviously not a good solution. There should be a way to get this new array format (or whatever array format is decided on) to work automatically with the In Array Validator.

Can't understand why this path is still not officially integrated to zf ? This is very usefull in the case of javascript multi select.

I think we need to address the array validation problem before applying this. Bradley, have you had a chance to look into that further?

Matthew, unfortunately I have not had a chance to look into the problem with the patch breaking the Array Validator.
