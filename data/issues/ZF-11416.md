ZF-11416: Fatal Error in PHP 5.3.5 and ZF 1.11.6

### Description

The following error is received using Zend Framework 1.11.6 with PHP 5.3.5:

Fatal error: Cannot access property started with '\\0' in /Users/kwilson/www/Zend/View/Abstract.php on line 308

It seems to be an internal ZF error. Adding the following code to \_\_set():

if(substr($key, 0, 1) == "\\0") { echo '

<

pre>'; var\_dump($key); var\_dump(trim($key)); exit; }

Gives the result of:

string(25) "Zend\_View\_useViewStream" string(24) "Zend\_View\_useViewStream"

I wonder where this option "Zend\_View\_useViewStream" comes from, could you provide your bootstrap code or config file if you use Zend\_Application? Preferably unaltered so you maybe upload it somewhere instead of pasting it.

Our codeset is really large. I will try to condense it down and provide something to reproduce the issue.

While trying to condense the code down, I found some bad code in our system causing this. It had to do with calling a partial and passing (array)$this as the parameters.

The data assigned to the view seems to be the problem here. I don't think the framework can circumvent this.

Setting a public member with a leading "\\0" raises this fatal fatal error. If a magic \_\_set() function is present, the error is not raised and the function is properly called. In this case, the function tries to set the member again, wich of course fails.
