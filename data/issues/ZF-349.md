### Description

sometimes we use libraries which are uses PDO and to don't make new connection there should be public function getConnection() in Abstract.php

public function getConnection() { return $this->\_connection; }

Which will return protected method $\_connection

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract does have a public method getConnection().  
 This has been in the code since at least 3/22/2006.

Do you mean a different class? Which class do you mean?

No comment from user. As far as I can tell, the requested method has always existed in the code since we adopted the subversion source code control.
