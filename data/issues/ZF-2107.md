I mistook. in the description. It should apply to Zend\_Filter\_Alpha.

I correct description in following: ^\\p{Ll}\\p{Lu}\\p{N} is more better.

I mistook in attachment. ^[:alpha:]\\p{N} should been ^[:alnum:]

I make test pattern for Zend\_Filter\_AlnumTest.php . I hope this will be useful.

I offered a solution in the file attachments, but it does not be discussed or applied.

Did this make it in to 1.5.0?

 

 

Posted by old of Satoru Yoshida (yoshida@zend.co.jp) on 2008-03-21T20:33:21.000+0000

No, I thought it into 1.0.5 if 1.0.5 is scheduled. But, I find it in 1.5.0 now. So , I change list box of Fix version to 1.5.0

 

 

Posted by Darby Felton (darby) on 2008-04-02T08:58:37.000+0000

Yes, these changes made it into 1.5.0, as you can see from the Fisheye tab (SVN r8732).
