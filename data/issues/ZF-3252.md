### Description

Been unable to find this nor any instructions on how to install the Gdata APIs. Although it would be desirable to have instructions on how to install this, at least a documentation fix should be made I think if you are not going to include the file, or, include the file.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.

It looks like the GData distro doesn't include the INSTALL.txt file. We can either include that file in its original form or modify it for the GData package. It can be found at /INSTALL.txt on trunk and the release branches.

Alex, I think the proper fix for this problem is to include the INSTALL.txt in the vendor packages- GData, InfoCard, and AMF.

Fixed. Packages build scripts are modified to include INSTALL.txt
