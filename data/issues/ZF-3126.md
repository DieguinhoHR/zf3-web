When I run your code I retrieve

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    15.02.2008 00:00:00


As you did not set your locale and also did not set a proper format Zend\_Date will use the default format from the locale which is automatically detected by your browser or environment.

I am sure the class does all correct.

Look what is the default format for your locale and look if there is any difference to your input format. Also you could set the input format manually if you know how it looks like.

It is detecting the right format and locale before I add the month. I don't understand what is different in your setup and why it works with year but not month.

And how should we understand ? We have tried with 'de\_AT', 'en' and 'ar' and also with different timezones.

If you do not give us any data for reproduction we will have to close this issue as unreproducable.

I have made a simple test script that I am using outside of any zend application:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');
    require_once '/Users/jason/Sites/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Date.php';
    
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-01-15 00:00:00', null, 'en_US');
    $firstDate = $date->toString() .' -> ';
    
    $date2 = new Zend_Date();
    $secondDate = $date2->toString() .' -> ';
    
    $date->add('1', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    $date2->add('1', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    
    echo $firstDate . $date->toString() .'<br></br>';
    echo $secondDate . $date2->toString();
    
    ?>


This outputs the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Jan 15, 2008 12:00:00 AM -> Feb 1, 2008 12:00:00 AM
    Apr 19, 2008 2:11:38 PM -> May 1, 2008 2:11:38 PM


I don't know what else there is to set. Or what I am missing.

When adding / substracting months you should set the "extend\_month" option. This is described within the manual :

See [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.overview.html) Zend\_Date Options -> Month Calculations

    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array('extend_month' => true));


This fixed it.

Per the documentation, though:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    For example, when adding one month to January 31st, people familiar with SQL will expect February 28th as the result.  On the other side, people familiar with Excel and OpenOffice will expect March 3rd as the result.


A simple test. Notice the year 2007, as 2008 is a leap year.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');
    require_once '/Users/jason/Sites/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Date.php';
    
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-31 00:00:00', null, 'en_US');
    $outDate = $date->toString() .' -> ';
    $date->add('1', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    
    echo $outDate . $date->toString() .'<br></br>';
    
    Zend_Date::setOptions(array('extend_month' => true));
    
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-31 00:00:00', null, 'en_US');
    $outDate = $date->toString() .' -> ';
    $date->add('1', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    
    echo $outDate . $date->toString() .'<br></br>';
    
    ?>


This returns:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Jan 31, 2007 12:00:00 AM -> Mar 1, 2007 12:00:00 AM
    Jan 31, 2007 12:00:00 AM -> Mar 3, 2007 12:00:00 AM


The first result is not the expected Feb 28th.

Another interesting thing I found, adding a month to Jan 1:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    date_default_timezone_set('America/New_York');
    require_once '/Users/jason/Sites/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Date.php';
    
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-01 00:00:00', null, 'en_US');
    $outDate = $date->toString() .' -> ';
    $date->add('1', Zend_Date::MONTH);
    
    echo $outDate . $date->toString();
    
    ?>


Will return:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Jan 1, 2007 12:00:00 AM -> Jan 1, 2007 12:00:00 AM

Note on adding the month to Jan 1, it works with the extend\_month set, but not without it.

You forgot the DST change (summer/wintertime) in your first example. Also in your second example you did not set a timezone which results in the date having 5 hours substracted due to your default timezone and your given UTC date.

This is not a problem... when you have problems with date maths please use the mailing lists and not the issue tracker.
