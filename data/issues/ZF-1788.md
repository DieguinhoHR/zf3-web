### Description

I'm finding the way Z\_S\_L handles match-highlighting to be quite limiting, the fixed list of colours clashes badly with the colour-scheme of my app, and I would like to be able to change them from my code, rather than by editing Zend's things.

Ideally, you would provide a way of extending the Html\_Document class, so that I could replace the highlighting with one that adds CSS classnames rather than inline colours, but providing access to the colours array would be a step in the right direction.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
