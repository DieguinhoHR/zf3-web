ZF-5893: Can not connect to Oracle Database with SERVICE\_NAME and can't use tnsnames.ora as well

### Description

I am using zend core version 2.5.2 and attempting to connect to Oracle 10g database. I used following code to set up the details $config = new Zend\_Config( array( 'database' => array( 'adapter' => 'pdo\_oci', 'params' => array('host'=> 'host1, 'port'=>'1521','dbname'=> 'DEV','username' => 'dev','password' => 'pwd') ) ) ); $db = Zend\_Db::factory($config->database); Zend\_Db\_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db);

I keep getting ORA-12505: TNS:listener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor (ext\\pdo\_oci\\oci\_driver.c:581)' for this. The database is expecting SERVICE\_NAME instead of SID. And for this reason I can't seem to connect to the database.

I tried putting TNS\_ADMIN in environment variable and assign tnsnames.ora entry to dbname. Then I get illegal address parameter error. I could connect to the databases which can accept SID parameter. But since this is clustered database, it expects service\_name. Any help is appreciated. I am running out of ideas.

I changed:

../library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Oci.php line 89: replaced SID with SERVICE\_NAME

It is working fine now.

Which version of the Pdo\_Oci adapter are you using? There's a patched version in the trunk that allows you to use tnsnames.ora.

We are using zend core v2.5. I couldn't see any version info on pdo\_oci in admin console. But found following line in ../ZendFramework/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Oci.php file

@version $Id: Oci.php 11942 2008-10-13 20:21:18Z mikaelkael $

Try the new 1.8, please

We are using the Oracle Easy Connect syntax in conjunction with the service name. I think this approach is better, because all the configuration is within the Zend\_Config, we are not reliant on the TNSNAMES being configured correctly. Obviously, if you have a cluster or something like that, TNSNAMES is probably the better option:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $config = new Zend_Config(
    array(
    'database' => array(
    'adapter' => 'oracle',
    'params' => array('dbname'=> '//hostname.domain.tld/service_name','username' => 'dev','password' => 'pwd')
    )
    )
    );
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($config->database);
    Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db);

Hi,

For us, Oracle Easy Connect syntax does not work. To resolve the problem we need to use tnsnames.ora syntax :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config(
    array(
    'database' => array(
    'adapter' => 'oracle',
    'params' => array(
        'dbname'=> '(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = hostname.domain.tld)(PORT = 1521))(CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = service_name)))',
        'username' => 'dev',
        'password' => 'pwd')
        )
    )
    );
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($config->database);
    Zend_Db_Table::setDefaultAdapter($db); 


...
