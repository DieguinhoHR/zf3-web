### Description

Using version 1.9 trying to save my session into a database I get a couple of errors.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // set up the session DB Table
             $config = array(
                 'name'           => 'session',
                 'primary'        => 'id',
                 'modifiedColumn' => 'modified',
                 'dataColumn'     => 'data',
                 'lifetimeColumn' => 'lifetime',
                 'lifetime'       => 604800,
                 'db'             => Zend_Registry::get('db_master') 
             );
    
            //create your Zend_Session_SaveHandler_DbTable and
            //set the save handler for Zend_Session
            Zend_Session::setSaveHandler(new Zend_Session_SaveHandler_DbTable($config));
             
            Zend_Session::start();


Gives me these errors: Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select in /Zend/Db/Table/Select.php on line 220

Fatal error: Access to undeclared static property: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::$\_writeClosed in Unknown on line 0

This is happening almost the same to me when trying to implemenet session handler DBTable.

What did you do in order to avoid theses errors?? I'm following the manual [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.session.savehandler.dbtable.html) and I have tried to debug this error without success!

Thank you for any help!

(I'm not sure, Should I had have to clone this issue to get any answer?) (ZF version: 1.10.0)

@Periko Please post your code so I try to simulate from it(could post in <http://pastebin.com/>).

Thanks ;).

@Periko, I have not made any code modifications to get this to work. I noticed this was happening on my server with CentOS 5 and PHP 5.3.

I ended up reinstalling Cent and re-compiling PHP and this cleared up the strange errors I was getting. I did not change any code.

I'm still not sure what the root cause of this was. I racked my brain for a couple of days trying to figure this one out because there is not really a workaround that I know of if you have this issue. The only thing that worked for me was reinstalling everything on the server, and that cleared it up.
