### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight"> Akrabat: I'm really liking it,  started playing with another Dojo Foundation project, Django to compare it with my learning curve on ZF ... must say its "getting started tutorial" is much faster and more understandable than the ZF one
     we connect to a database over a network for convenience on a lot of jobs but the box is only 10m away on gigabit lan
     Davidoff, someone is talking to you @ PM
     tk, if there are any concrete points, please make sure to add them to the issue tracker
     how we desactivate the view in action controller?
     tk: django is supposed to be nice.
     sorry, webchat - chatzilla died
     django is cool
     M4d3L: $this->_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender();
     M4d3L: you may also need $this->_helper->layout->disableLayout();
     Freeaqingme: maybe it would be worth taking a look at by someone who is more apt with ZF and seeing how the same tutorial ocmpares in ZF -- doing the tutorial once I am able to start and put up a new project w/o any hassle... ZF always took figuring out even after reading through some books
     (ie, write the same app in ZF that Django uses for its tutorial)
     I'd guess django's tutorial takes advantage of their admin system though
     Freeaqingme: i think my biggest problem was the boiler plate for ZF was fairly substantial and I never really was able to udnerstand what it was doing
     Akrabat: one part of it does, yes
     ... says a dojo dev
     django is much better hiding what it does from what I understand
     :P
     phiggins: ?
     tk "and I never really was able to udnerstand what it was doing"
    


This issue is meant for me personally. Please do not reassign.
