Please give further informations for reproduction

How is Zend\_Translate initiated? Which configurations settings are used? How are the translation stored in the file system? Which locale is used? and so on...

The warning itself is too less information for a reproduction

I am not able to reproduce this behaviour. As there is no further response from the reporter since more than 5 weeks I am closing this issue. Feel free to reopen it when you have further informations for reproduction.
