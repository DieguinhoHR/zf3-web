### Description

Zend\_Validate does not use php built-in filter\_var function. Here is a list of Validate filters that could be implemented : [http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.validate.php)

I did an example for email : [http://posterous.weedo.fr/a-simpler-email-address-…](http://posterous.weedo.fr/a-simpler-email-address-validator-for-zend)

The email validator as currently written actually covers more cases than found in PHP's filter\_var() functionality, and this is true of a large number of the various validators that have similar counter-parts in filter\_var(). (Most ZF validators can be locale-aware, allowing for more flexible validation than filter\_var() offers).

BTW, you might be interested in Zend\_Validate\_Callback, which allows you to specify your own callback for validations. When used in PHP 5.3, this allows you to curry arguments in and pass them to filter\_var() easily:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $validator = new Zend_Validate_Callback(function($value) {
        return filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
    });


One nice part of this validator is that you can also pass in custom error messages. :)

In addition to what Matthew already said. PHP's filter\_var functionality is often buggy. Try running the Zend\_Validate testsuite against the filter\_var() features and you'll find out that zend\_Validate sticks better to the RFC's than filter\_var by far.

OK, Thank you for the clarification :)
