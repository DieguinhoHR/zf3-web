### Description

The inline documentation for Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps::insertNickname, insertEmailList, and insertEmailListRecipient all list $user as a parameter, even though they don't actually have a $user parameter.

These also list $url as a parameter instead of $uri.

The docs should be updated to correct this.

Updated to note that $uri is also wrong.

Attaching patch as [^ZF-1827\_ZF-1902\_v1.patch].

I don't have a Google Apps account with API access to test this with, so somebody else will need to run the unit tests against this before this can be checked in.
