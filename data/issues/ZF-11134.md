ZF-11134: Need to support others schemes
----------------------------------------

### Description

Actualy it's impossible to add support of other scheme than http and https without duplicate Zend\_Uri class, and so other subclasses because their constructors are protected and extends Zend\_Uri.

I suggest to make a table likes :

protected $schemeClasses = array( 'http' => 'Zend\_Uri\_Http', 'https' => 'Zend\_Uri\_Http', );

And some methods like addSchemmeClass($scheme, $classname)

Hi,

We're planning to address this in the design of Zend Uri 2.0 for ZF 2.0. I did not plan on changing this for ZF 1.x.

If you can take a look at the planned proposal and comment, that would be nice.
