### Description

If I define parent form, set all decorators for elements and add some subforms, these decorators doesn't propagate to subforms so if I want elements in subforms to appear same as in parent form, I have to define element decorators for each subform separately.

What about adding functionality to tell subform to inherit decorators from it's parent form automatically?

Sorry for my mistake, prefix paths are already inherited, just decorators need to be defined manually.
