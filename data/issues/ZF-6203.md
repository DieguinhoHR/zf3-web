### Description

With PHP 5.3 using Zend\_Tool\_Framework with Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console::main(); causes me a

PHP Strict standards: Declaration of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Filesystem\_File::setResource() should be compatible with that of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Filesystem\_Abstract::setResource() in Zend/Tool/Project/Context/Filesystem/File.php on line 116

closely followed by a

Strict standards: Declaration of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Filesystem\_File::setResource() should be compatible with that of Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Filesystem\_Abstract::setResource() in Zend/Tool/Project/Context/Filesystem/File.php on line 116.

In Development this is just annoying since you might want E\_STRICT warnings for your own code.

As far as I can tell, the signatures of these methods (Both in File and Abstract) are exactly the same. This warning should not be raised.

PHP 5.3 is currently not supported by ZF, also, PHP 5.3 has not been released and several issues have been filed against the release candidates. All of the code in Zend Framework is run against E\_STRICT and I cannot seem to duplicate this issue in PHP 5.2.7.

If you find this is still and issue, please reopen.
