### Description

ViewHelper decorator has this code:

$elementContent = $view->$helper($name, $value, $attribs, $element->options);

to display the element. The problem is that dojo helpers, including Textarea and others, require 4th argument to be array, while if $element has no special options, this call would have it as null, which produces an error. So this code:

 
    $this->addElement('SimpleTextarea', 'comment', array(
            'required'   => false,
            'label'      => 'Comment: ',
        ));


would fail if element decorator is set to ViewHelper.
