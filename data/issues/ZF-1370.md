### Description

final protected function \_forward($action, $controller = null, $module = null, array $params = null)

Due to fact \_forward function is final can't be superseded. I can't see any reason for not allowing users to define a custom behavior for \_forward.

Requests such as this one come in every now and then to the lists.

Several methods are marked final in the action controller: \_getParam(), \_setParam(), \_hasParam(), \_getAllParams(), and \_forward(). In each case, the underlying functionality is considered essential to basic usage -- i.e., changing it would lead to unexpected results. Using the 'final' visibility operator is the correct way of protecting these from being overridden.

Marking as "Won't Fix".
