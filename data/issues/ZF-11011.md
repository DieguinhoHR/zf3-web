### Description

I can't seem to ->set(02, Zend\_Date::MONTH) on a Zend\_Date instance. Controlled test:

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    
            $upcomingHolidays = array(array('holidayDate' => '0000-01-01'), array('holidayDate' => '0000-02-01'), array('holidayDate' => '0000-03-01'));
    
            if(is_array($upcomingHolidays)) {
                foreach($upcomingHolidays as $holiday) {
    
                    $dateParts = explode('-', str_replace('0000-', '', $holiday['holidayDate']));
    
                    $date = new Zend_Date();
    
                    $date->set((int) $dateParts[0], Zend_Date::MONTH);
                    $date->set((int) $dateParts[1], Zend_Date::DAY);
                    $date->set(date('Y'), Zend_Date::YEAR);
                    $date->set('0000:00:00', Zend_Date::TIME_LONG);
    
                    Zend_Debug::dump($date->toString(), 'Zend Date Output');
                    Zend_Debug::dump($dateParts, 'date parts');
                    Zend_Debug::dump($holiday, 'holiday array');
    
                    unset($date);
                    unset($dateParts);
                }
    
                exit;
            }
    


 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    Zend Date Output  
    string 'Jan 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM' (length=23)
    date parts 
    array
      0 => string '01' (length=2)
      1 => string '01' (length=2)
    holiday array 
    array
      'holidayDate' => string '0000-01-01' (length=10)
    
    
    
    Zend Date Output 
    string 'Mar 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM' (length=23)
    date parts 
    array
      0 => string '02' (length=2)
      1 => string '01' (length=2)
    holiday array 
    array
      'holidayDate' => string '0000-02-01' (length=10)
    
    
    
    Zend Date Output 
    string 'Mar 1, 2011 12:00:00 AM' (length=23)
    date parts 
    array
      0 => string '03' (length=2)
      1 => string '01' (length=2)
    holiday array 
    array
      'holidayDate' => string '0000-03-01' (length=10)

Formatted the code in this issue

Closing as non-issue:

Your code is bogus and fails on some dates.

First you set the actual date by new Zend\_Date(). Let's expect that this date is the 30.04.2010 Then you set the month... doing this within february would lead to "30.02.2010"...

But within the gregorian calendar the 30 february does not exist. Now it depends on which options you set within Zend\_Date... it seems as you used "extend\_month = true" so the days extending the 28 february are added (extended) to the next month (like excel does it) which leads to 02 March 2010

Then you set the day so it reverts to 01 March 2010

As you see Zend\_Date behaves correct... for dates its always better to set a complete date at once instead of part by part
