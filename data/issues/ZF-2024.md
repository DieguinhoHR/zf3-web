"end\_translation" is no function from the Zend Framework. Please contact the development of your 3rd Party Tool using the Zend Framework.

Zend\_translate is not a function. This is a class. Please read carefully.

Even if you edited the description to fit what you meant...

I still dont see the problem even if you mean the Zend Framwork class Zend\_Translate... Maybe you can describe it a little bit better ??

Where is your problem with the constructor ???

Zend Framework API:

Zend\_Translate \_\_construct (string $adapter, array $options, [string|Zend\_Locale $locale = null])

Actual 1.0.2 Zend\_Transalate class constructor method:

public function \_\_construct($adapter, $options, $locale = null) { $this->setAdapter($adapter, $options, $locale); }

Where setAdapter method is being used incorrectly:

public function setAdapter($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array()) { switch (strtolower($adapter)) { case 'array': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Array'; break; case 'csv': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Csv'; break; case 'gettext': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext'; break; case 'qt': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Qt'; break; case 'tmx': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Tmx'; break; case 'xliff': $adapter = 'Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Xliff'; break; }

 
        Zend_Loader::loadClass($adapter);
        $this->_adapter = new $adapter($data, $locale, $options);
        if (!$this->_adapter instanceof Zend_Translate_Adapter) {
            require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("Adapter " . $adapter . " does not extend Zend_Translate_Adapter'");
        }
    }


As you can see, there is no way to actually pass any "real" options to the adapter because the Zend\_Translate constructor doesn't accept the options as the options but as the actual data file.

So the proposed solution will be (as mentioned by Lex):

public function \_\_construct($adapter, $data, $locale = null, array $options = array())

Sorry, but I still can't see the problem...

Within the trunk this changeset has been done at the 22.July.2007.

But this change was not prooved. And I am not allowed to include un-prooved code within the release brunch.

If you download the actual developer-release or the nightly snapshot, you could test the change done by SVN 5809 (we have now SVN 6598), and proove it, so I can add it to the branch.

From time to time I am writing Code-Review Requests to the community. But I never got response...

Such issues are then the result. So if you check the trunk and give me response / proove the code I am allowed to add it to the branch.
