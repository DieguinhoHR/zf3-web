### Description

The manual at: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.functions.html) States (Set a new locale section): "Since Zend\_Locale objects are "light", this method exists primarily to cause side-effects for code that have references to the existing instance object."

Shouldn't it be: "Since Zend\_Locale objects are "light", this method exists primarily to prevent side-effects for code that has references to the existing instance object."
