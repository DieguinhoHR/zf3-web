ZF-7028: Zend\_Application does not check for the Bootstrap path/class passed to it

### Description

Actually a user can provide any path, containing any class to setBootStrap() , it will just blindly try to make an instance of it.

When loading the path, It doesn't check that the file contains the right class. When instantiating the class, it doesn't check before that it's a Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Bootstrapper class, which introduces a bug.

The patch is attached, can matthew or Zend person review it that way I can commit it with the appropriates tests ?

It can be done much simpler and less expensively.

Within the body of the "if (!class\_exists($class, false))" conditional, you can do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once $path;
    if (!class_exists($class, false)) {
        throw some exception
    }


Following the instantiation of the class, we can simply check against instanceof:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$this->_bootstrap instanceof Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrapper) {
        throw some exception
    }


Unit tests would simply need to define a file that loads a different class than expected in the first case, and a class not implementing the bootstrapper in the second case.

Fixed in trunk and 1.8 release branch.
