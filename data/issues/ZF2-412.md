### Description

The second Callback is not called. I switched between them and got same result (the new second was not called)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->add($factory->createInput(array(
        'name'       => 'related_activity_id',
        'required'   => true,
        'validators' => array(
            array(
                'name' => 'Digits',
                'options' => array(
                    'messages' => array(
                        'notDigits' => "No Related Activity ID was selected for update",
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            array(
                'name'              => 'Callback',
                'options'           => array(
                    'callback'      => array($model, 'isRelatedActivityConnected'),
                    'messages'      => array(
                        'callbackValue'  => "The Related Activity is already connected to the current Activity",
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            array(
                'name'              => 'Callback',
                'options'           => array(
                    'callback'      => array($model, 'activityExist'),
                    'messages'   => array(
                            'callbackValue'  => "The submited Related Activity ID does not exist",
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    )));

Can you verify that you have both callback validators registered, and that they are different instances? I suspect that you're getting the same instance, but I want to verify. If that's the case, we can easily patch this.

I verified it, and discovered the same issue in FilterChain. A PR has been created to resolve the issue: <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/2011>
