### Description

I am using Hudson integration server. Its default configuration uses ".hudson" directory as a location for job files. I have encountered a problem with the following configuration:

resources.locale.default = "pl" resources.translate.adapter = gettext resources.translate.data = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/locales" resources.translate.scan = Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_DIRECTORY resources.translate.ignore.special = "." resources.translate.ignore.regex = "/.po$/"

I am ignoring hidden files (e.g. ".svn") and ignoring translation sources (i.e. ".po") The problem is that when the units test are run from the ".hudson" directory i.e. APPLICATION\_PATH is something like this ".../.hudson/..." than the whole locale directory ".../.hudson/.../data/locales" is ignored completely because it containts the dot "." or so it seems...

In my opinion "the base" locale directory i.e. APPLICATION\_PATH "/../data/locales" should not be matched against the ignore patterns - only its subdirectory paths.

Fixed in ZF2 with [GH-294](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/294)
