ZF-1231: Global Formatter for all writers
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2007-04-09T17:27:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:04.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Its annoying to add a single formatter to all existing writers, so it would be easier to allow to define a global formatter to the log and single writers are able to overwrite it (if needed).

Writers may share a Formatter instance. Create a single instance and then pass it to each writer.

 <?php require 'Zend/Log.php'; require 'Zend/Log/Writer/Stream.php'; $formatter = new Zend\_Log\_Formatter\_Simple('hello %message%' . PHP\_EOL); $writer1 = new Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream('<a>php://output</a>'); $writer1->setFormatter($formatter); $writer2 = new Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream('<a>php://output</a>'); $writer2->setFormatter($formatter); $log = new Zend\_Log(); $log->addWriter($writer1); $log->addWriter($writer2); $log->info('there'); // hello there // hello there ?> It is not desirable to have a global formatter on the log object because not all writers may accept a formatter and there would potentially be conflicts between the global formatter and the formatter set on each writer. If you can make such a feature cleanly, you are welcome to submit a patch.
