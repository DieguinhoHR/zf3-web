### Description

When you rely on Zend\_Application for setting PHP's include path, it actually _prepends_ the paths we set up to the actual include path.

I think an option should be proposed to the developer if he wants defined include paths to be prepended or appended to its actual include path.

Think about ZF being at first position in the PHP.INI include path for performance reasons. Using then Zend\_Application puts all the defined include path _before_ ZendFramework, and this is not good for performances as the performance documentation chapter reminds us.

We could do something like this :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function setIncludePaths(array $paths, $append = false)
        {
            $path = implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $paths);
            if (!$append) {
            set_include_path($path . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
            } else {
            set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . paths);
            }
            return $this;
        }


$append should be configurable throught Zend\_Application (aka passing it via a Zend\_Config object should be possible)

looks to me that it appends the path already?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $path = implode(PATH_SEPARATOR, $paths);
            set_include_path($path . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path());
            return $this;

Zend\_Application prepends them as the assumption is that these are paths for your application and library code -- and as such should have preference over ZF code itself (for instance, consider if you have patched versions of ZF class files -- you can maintain them in your own version control and have them found while still using svn:externals or systemwide ZF install for the full library).

If you have a very specific include\_path you need to use for performance reasons, it's often better to set this in your php.ini or vhost definition.
