### Description

Nested CDATA sections cause an XML parse error because the closing triad "]]>" cannot appear inside a CDATA section.

The issue doesn't occur in release-1.10 branch because the nested CDATA section has its closing sequence URL encoded. The issue exists in 1.10.2 tag and currently trunk.

I think the correct way to solve it would be to escape the closing sequence with another CDATA tag instead of URL encoding it. the attached patch does this.
