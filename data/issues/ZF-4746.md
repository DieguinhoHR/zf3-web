### Description

Section 3.2.2 does not make clear that the '$this->\_auth' variable is an instance of Zend\_Auth. Please add something like $this->\_auth = Zend\_Auth::getInstance(); to clarify.

Right now it pretty unambiguously says:

// authenticate with Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable $result = $this->\_auth->authenticate($adapter);

Looks like it's been fixed. :)
