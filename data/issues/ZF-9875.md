ZF-9875: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 barfs with multiple requests in same process containing headers.

### Description

If multiple requests are made in the same process (cron job) that involve headers being sent to Amazon Web Services it wil barf. This is due to the TRUE parameter not being set in the \_makeRequest method on line 554 of Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3. The resetParameters call is trying to clean up the static Zend\_Http\_Client but without it being passed true it will not clean up the headers properly.

This issue occurs when using different Zend\_Service\_\* classes during the same process.

I used Zend\_Service\_Twitter to post a status update, then attempted to update Amazon S3 with Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3. The calls to S3 failed repeatedly and returned "Unsupported Authorization Type" from the S3 API.

After some digging, it appears that the client is not reset, and at some point, both services call the static Zend\_Service\_Abstract::getHttpClient() which ends up in my case providing Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 an http client instance littered with params and headers relating to the twitter call.

The fix was to simply set Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3::setHttpClient(new Zend\_Http\_Client); but I would expect these classes to do there own cleanup and not share dirty http client instances.
