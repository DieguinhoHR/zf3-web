### Description

The below form never finished it seems to the validation some how swapped! If the form contains single file element its working as expected. I tried to track it down without result.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class ProductForm extends Zend_Dojo_Form{
    
        public function __construct(){
            parent::__construct();
                    $image = new Zend_Form_Element_File('image');
            $image->setLabel('Image:');
            $image->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_File_Extension(array('gif', 'jpg', 'png')));
            $image->setIgnore(true);
    
            $brochure = new Zend_Form_Element_File('brochure');
            $brochure->setLabel('Brochure:');
            $brochure->addValidator(new Zend_Validate_File_Extension(array('pdf', 'doc')));
            $brochure->setIgnore(true);
    
                   $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
            $submit->setLabel('Submit');
            $submit->setRequired(false);
            $submit->setIgnore(true);
    
                    $this->addElement($image);
            $this->addElement($brochure);
            $this->addElement($submit);
            $this->setMethod("post");
            $this->setAttrib('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');
        }
    
    }

2 different file elements are for now not supported if you use different validators. This is a feature request we already know.

Multiple files should work with trunk release. Please test and report back.

Note: Subforms are not supported until now! This is a separat issue Note: Dojo is a complete different thing. When you're having problems with Dojo please assign a dojo issue and not a form issue.

If I get no response until 22.Sept. I will close this issue as solved.
