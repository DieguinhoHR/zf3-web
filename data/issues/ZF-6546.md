### Description

I'm getting an empty string when using the front controller resource helper when setting the baseurl key. Is this an issue. After dumping the value in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller it appears that's it's running twice. The original value being correct the second instance an empty string. The Zend\_Application array I'm working with is below for clarification.

 
    'resources'   => array(
        'frontController' => array(
            'baseurl' => '/phpower',
            'moduleDirectory' => APPLICATION_PATH . '/modules',
            'plugins' => array(
                  'acl' => 'App_Plugin_Auth_Acl'            


), 'actionhelperpaths' => array( 'Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper' => APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules/default/helpers' ) ),

We have a test case for this in place already, and the test passes. To confirm, I've even checked in a sample app to see that it gets properly set in the request object -- and it does.

Closing, a unable to reproduce with the information provided.

The problem was duplicating the same keys in the production/staging/testing/development hierarchy. In this case bootstrap was defined in production correctly and also defined in development as an empty string. This is a case of not paying strict attention to the resource settings. My bad. Thanks Mathew for responding so quickly!
