I'm unable to reproduce this bug:

var\_dump(Zend\_Json::decode(Zend\_Json::encode("1")));

-> string(1) "1"

I've tested it in 1.10.2 and 1.10.3 - both versions yield the same result.

[EDIT: I was unable to reproduce the bug, but someone pointed out to me that it could be a PHP-related bug, because Zend\_Json mostly uses <http://php.net/json>. Can you tell us what version of PHP you are using?]

yes, it's about the php-functions json\_encode and json\_decode. Zend Framework uses them, if the functions exist.

there is also a related bug-report: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38680>

Thanks - I have a better understanding of the underlying problem now, but according to that bug report, it sounds as though they've squashed the bug.

To confirm, I installed PHP 5.2.4 (the earliest version of PHP that ZF currently supports), and I was still unable to reproduce the bug.

Are you using an earlier version of PHP? If so, I think we should resolve this as "could not reproduce" or "not a bug".

However, if you're using 5.2.4 or greater, then I guess we'll have to dig a bit deeper to find out what's going on.
