ZF-10064: Double function call
------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-06-28T05:39:12.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-07-04T03:18:56.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.7 (28/Jul/10)

### Description

I think that the constructor in Zend\_Locale can get rid of one call:

$locale = self::\_prepareLocale($locale);

I think this one is superfluous because setLocale() is called next, which does the same at line 1 of the function.

Agreed to make the code be faster for 1 Âµs.
