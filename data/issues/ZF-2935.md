### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function validateHost($host = null)
        {
            if ($host === null) {
                $host = $this->_host;
            }
    
            /** 
             * If the host is empty, then it is considered invalid
             */
            if (strlen($host) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
    
            /**
             * Check the host against the allowed values; delegated to Zend_Filter.
             */
            $validate = new Zend_Validate_Hostname(Zend_Validate_Hostname::ALLOW_ALL);
            return $validate->isValid($host);
        }


I see two problems here:

1) Zend\_Uri\_Http::validateHost currently defaults to ALLOW\_ALL when validating the hostname. This is inconsistent with other sections of code (Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress, Zend\_Validate\_Hostname) which default to ALLOW\_DNS (the expected behavior based on the documentation for Zend\_Validate\_Hostname).

2) There is currently no way to override this flag in the validateHost function.

It is inconsistent, but is there any real-world use case where this becomes a handicap? We can easily rejig the component to allow setting the validator while maintaining BC, but doing so just because it's possible isn't the right reason.
