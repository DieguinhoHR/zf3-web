### Description

Hi, I have updated from ZF 1.11 to ZF 1.12 and found that I can`t use my SOAP calls. In Zend/Soap/Server.php on line 732 is method libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader() called, but this method is available from PHP >= 5.2.11. I am running on

 
    <pre class="highlight">PHP 5.2.0-8+etch16 (cli)


and actually can not update until some issues are fixed or reimplemented. In install requirements instructions for ZF 1.12 you write that you need minimum PHP 5.2.4 or later ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/requirements.introduction.html)) so that is also my fault we run on 5.2.0 but this method libxml\_disable\_entity\_loader() is only available from PHP 5.2.11. ([http://php.net/manual/en/…](http://php.net/manual/en/function.libxml-disable-entity-loader.php)) So do you think about providing some patch for this (that would be just awesome) or will you update the requirements install instructions for ZF 1.12 for this issue and change the minimal version from 5.2.4 as you write to 5.2.11?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend recommends the most current release of PHP for critical security and performance enhancements, and currently supports PHP 5.2.11 or later.


Thank you very much for your time&effort!

As this is the result of a security fix, we have updated the minimum version of PHp for ZF 1.12 to be 5.2.11

Hi,

Where are you looking? The change so far has been made in the source code.

Okay. That should automatically change when we release 1.12.1.
