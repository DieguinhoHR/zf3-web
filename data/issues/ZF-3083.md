### Description

This if statement in partialLoop() evaluates to true when given an empty array. This should not be the case, as exceptions will be thrown when module name is given.

Starts on line 57:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((null == $model) && (null !== $module)) {
        $model  = $module;
        $module = null;
    } 


Should read:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ((null === $model) && (null !== $module)) {
        $model  = $module;
        $module = null;
    } 


Notice the triple ===.

Test added in trunk and 1.5 release branch; unable to reproduce, but changes for other bugs may have fixed this previously. (Commit as of r9374)
