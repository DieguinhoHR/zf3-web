ZF-4668: Use of is\_uploaded\_file() and move\_uploaded\_file() makes forms impossible to test

### Description

In Zend\_File\_Trasfer and Zend\_Validate\_File folders these php functions are used: - is\_uploaded\_file() - move\_uploaded\_file() That makes the form where Zend\_Form\_File\_Element is inserted impossible to test with Zend\_Test. Faking $\_FILES superglobal array does not work because file pointed are not valid uploaded file. Only way is hack in the source of zf components.

And what should we do ? Delete a working solution because you can not test it ?

ZF can not solve problems of PHP itself. As soon as you try to change the $\_FILES array it will be recognised as attack and a error is thrown from PHP itself.

The only way how this can be tested can be seen in the testbed of ZF.

We will surely NOT delete a working solution because you are not able to test it.

This is a PHP problem not a ZF problem. Therefor we close this issue as won't fix.

Not said that, and no flame intended.

On php 5.2.4, with error\_reporting on E\_ALL | E\_STRICT, I cannot reproduce this behaviour. Can you give me an hint on how to see that?

I was talking of an integration test of controllers. It's nice to test dispatching of an homepage, but POST request are a more important and more likely to break part of an application. A possible proposal is to add a public static variable to Zend\_File\_Transfer like the one in Zend\_Session that will inhibit the use of move\_uploaded\_file() towards rename() and is\_uploaded\_file() to true. Since a controller test case is run by cli, this is not menacing security as who can set a variable on Zend\_File\_Transfer has already access to the machine. Also `grep -r "uploaded_file(" library/` gives 2 results, so it's a matter of 8-10 lines of code in total. I would like to write a proposed patch but I'm not familiar with zf development environment (how to assure a patch does not break existing regression tests).

Upload a file, change the name of the $\_FILES array, then use move\_uploaded\_file and you will get a attacker error from PHP.

Regarding to Coding Standard it is depreciated to add testcode in the final implementation. A mock adapter would be ok like done in Zend\_Db but this is not what you need.
