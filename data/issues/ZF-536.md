The patch is not good because the idea is to keep a pointer to the last header set. This can be fixed by saving the key instead of a pointer using code like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    end($headers)
    $last_header = key($headers);


( I will fix this soon )

resolved in r. 1802

I've reviewed the change in r1802, but I'm not convinced that this change is correct.

First of all, I believe we always want $last\_header to point to $h\_name. However, if $headers[$h\_name] is an array then this is not always the case. For instance, consider the following headers:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Header1: value1
    Header2: value2
    Header2: value3
    Header1: value4
             value5


When the 5th line is processed $last\_header will be set to "Header2" since that was the last key that was added to $headers, but it should be set to "Header1". So value5 will be appended to Header2.

Second, when we have a line that needs to be appended to the last header, if that last header happens to be an array of multiple values, it will be cast to the string "Array" and have the next line appended to it. So I'm guessing $headers will look as follows when given the sample headers from above (I'm pretending the first problem I mentioned does not exist here):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    array('Header1' => 'Arrayvalue5',
          'Header2' => array('value2', 'value3'));


These concerns are theoretical and I have not tested whether this causes actual problems in Zend\_Http\_Response. However, I don't see how this can work in the aforementioned corner case.

I am enclosing a patch which should fix this. Note that I have not tested this patch very well so it may have some issues.

While I'm reviewing this code I also have a question about the following line:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                } elseif (preg_match("|^\s+(\S+)$|", $line, $m) && $last_header !== null) {


Shouldn't the regular expression be something like "|^\\s+(.+)$|" instead? Otherwise the header values cannot have spaces in them.

Thanks, I committed your patch, fixed in r. 2047

Thanks. What about my comment regarding regular expressions -- is that something that needs to be addressed as well? Essentially, replace "|\\^\\s+(\\S+)$|" with something like "|\\^\\s+(.+)$|".

Oh, I forgot to mention it was also fixed. Thanks for that one!

Great! I should've checked Subversion before posting that comment. :) Thanks again!
