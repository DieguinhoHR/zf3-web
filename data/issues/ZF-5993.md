What should this filter do, what a simple cast couldn't do ?

Well my idea was, this filter will convert string to float.

In php is serious problem - if you use eg. setlocale(cs\_CZ), where decimal separator is comma instead of dot - when php converts string 100,10 to float, it truncates the decimal part.

I added this issue before i red your filter\_normalize/locale proposal, so this filter is not needed or this filter could be wrapper to cast normalize on float strings.

Casting just for having 2 different components which do exactly the same is useless. Closing this issue as won't fix.
