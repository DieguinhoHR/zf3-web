### Description

I have just downloaded the latest version of ZF from the trunk (Revision 12477), and my application stoped working with an error:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    Call Stack
    #   Time    Memory  Function    Location
    1   0.0000  76384   {main}( )   ../index.php:0
    2   0.0002  134048  Bootstrap::run( )   ../index.php:30
    3   0.0171  1905632 Zend_Controller_Front->dispatch( )  ../Bootstrap.php:61

I do not have session.auto-start turned on and prior to calling dispatch() I am running:

Zend\_Session::setSaveHandler(new My\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable($config));

and other bootstraping stuff (setting up view, assigning plugins, setting DB connection, ...).

The same code works with all prior versions of ZF.
