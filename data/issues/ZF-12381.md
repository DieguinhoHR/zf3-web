ZF-12381: Zend\_Validate\_File\_Hash fails if the expected hash value contains only numbers

### Description

In the very unlikely case that the hash of a file contains only digits (e.g. "32608459") the isValid() method of Zend\_Validate\_File\_Hash returns false. I found that the origin of the problem is at line 137 of the Hash.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_hash[$value] = $algorithm;


At this place $value is of type String. After the loop the key in $this->\_hash for this entry becomes an integer value. Thus, the validation statement in line 169

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($filehash === $hash) {


fails because of the typesafe comparison ("32608459" === 32608459 is FALSE).
