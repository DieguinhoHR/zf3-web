ZF-6036: Zend\_Db\_Statement::\_stripQuoted() behaves in a strange way!!

### Description

Please check the following: FILE: /usr/local/apache2/stc\_zend/Zend/Db/Statement.php LINE# 187 and LINE# 190

I'm trying to execute this query using Zend\_Db

$sql = "CALL STP\_getTitleInfo(\\'357\\');";

The Zend\_Db code calling Zend\_Db\_Statement::\_stripQuoted() method. But, after calling this function, my query turned into:

$sql = "CALL STP\_getTitleInfo();";

I have modified the 2 lines above to the following:

LINE:187 change to : $sql = preg\_replace("/$q($qe|\\\\{2}|^$q._!\\'$)_$q/", '', $sql); LINE: 190 change to : $sql = preg\_replace("/$q($qe|^$q._!\\'$)_$q/", '', $sql);

Is this update is valid? everything is working fine with me now!! Or if there anything i missed!

Thanks.

Please check and advice.

Thanks.

It seems like you really want to execute this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sql = "CALL STP_getTitleInfo('357');";


That should work. No need to quote when you are already inside double quotes.
