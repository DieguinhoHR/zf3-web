ZF-9300: Add support for rel="nofollow" attribute on anchors in Zend\_Navigation view helpers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-03-01T16:06:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-03-22T15:11:30.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Currently Navigation supports rel and rev attributes, but these are only used by the Links view helper. I've read multiple people needing rel="nofollow" on anchors, and although it's easily implemented using a custom view helper, it's also no work to implement this in the framework itself. So why not support it?

Also see: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7733>

Hi Maghiel, there are also for the "a" element many more options: [[http://w3.org/TR/html4/…](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.2)] Your patch allows only one option!

Hey Kai,

I wrote this patch because at that point there were some people on the mailing list asking to support rel="nofollow". But you're right, why not add all the options then?

I'll look deeper into this and change the issue accordingly (and attach a patch eventually), but now first going to have my friday night ;)

Thanks for the input!

At the moment you can only set the relation for "[Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Links](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.navigation.links)" with "[Zend\_Navigation\_Page::setRel()](http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/_Navigation_Page.html#Zend_Navigation_Page::setRel())".

We need a solution to set relations for the HTML Link element and for the HTML A element.

The HTML5 specification includes a nice overview in a table: <a href="">www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#linkTypes</a>" rel="nofollow">HTML5: 4.12 Links - 4.12.4 Link types There you can see which type is allowed for the Link element and which is allowed for the A element.
