### Description

I know an sample causes waring. The sample is in 36.3.2.2. Template Systems Using Zend\_View\_Interface.

Now , getScriptPaths method in sample class Zend\_View\_Smarty return waring message. The message is following. Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in........ Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php on line 322.

I propose to change getScriptPaths method from return $this->\_smarty->template\_dir; to return array($this->\_smarty->template\_dir);
