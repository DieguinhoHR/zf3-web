### Description

This would break BC but phpseclib's Crypt\_RSA seems much more feature packed then the RSA implementation in ZF. PEAR's own Crypt\_RSA has deprecated itself in favor of phpseclib's implementation.

Among other features phpseclib's Crypt\_RSA supports... more key formats, key conversion, PSS signing and OAEP encryption.
