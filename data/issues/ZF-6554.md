### Description

Hi people.

It will be very nice to be able to make forward to an existing email. This will prevent lot of work and bugs like: what will happen if you have an html but set it text? what will happen if you have attachments or is multipart and other.

I searched for this but didnt found anything so please forgive me if this request or feature exists already. Is first time I came here :).

How I see it now:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    //take an existing email
    $oldMail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap();
    
    //make new Zend_Mail that can accept a Zend_Mail_Storage_xx object
    $mail = new Zend_Mail($oldMail);
    
    //set new to
    $mail->addTo($oneEmail);
    
    //send
    $mail->send();


greets, Alex

This would be very nice. I also have a project where I need to forward a mail (from imap storage).

Because it is not possible with ZF, I have to do it with PEAR.

As a short term solution, would object cloning work? [<http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.cloning.php>]

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = clone $oldMail;

The problem is when reading a mail from an IMAP server you get a Zend\_Mail\_Message object, but for sending a mail you need a Zend\_Mail object. And there is no easy convert function for that.

Perhaps the problem is now a bit more clear.
