ZF-6692: Wrong use of subform name in case of subform name been 0, with array notation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

We have one form $form

$form->addSubForm($period, 0, 1); $form->setIsArray(true);

would result into naming the subform formname[] rather than formname[0].

I think is a mistake...
