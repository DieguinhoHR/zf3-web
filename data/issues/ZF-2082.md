### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File logs an error when the target cache directory doesn't exist or cannot be written, but still continues execution, where it tries to "fopen", and maybe "mkdir" and "chmod".

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the target directory cannot be accessed, this function can savely immediately "return false"!?
