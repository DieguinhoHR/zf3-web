### Description

I hope this is the right place to report this bug, couldnt find a issue tracker for ZendService\\Amazon.

AbstractEc2::setRegion() writes to $\_defaultRegion. But $\_defaultRegion is only used in the Constructor if you dont provide an region. In all other cases $\_region is used.

So if you have an instance of eg ZendService\\Amazon\\Ec2\\Instance and use setRegion its not used at all.

Fix: Line 104 in AbstractEc2 change to: self::$\_region = $region;
