ZF-6086: Bogus formatter given to Zend/Log/Writer/Abstract.php should throw an exception

### Description

If I give a bogus formatter to a writer, the formatter is accepted silently.

If I try to use the writer, a fatal error (eg "Fatal error: Call to a member function format() on a non-object in /usr/share/php5/Zend/Log/Writer/Stream.php on line 93") is outputted.

I think that the fatal error should be avoided and an exception should be thrown when the bogus formatter is set.

Regards, HUjuice
