### Description

Using Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql with an array for connection with username, dbname, hostname and passwort it works all fine on local machine. Trying to run on produtiv server, it crashed with a "wrong username/password" in mysql. It figures out, that providing a password like "foo§bar" turns into "foo??bar", so password is broken. Please fix!

This appears to be a simple encoding issue. Please ensure that your file in which the password is stored matches the character set of the rest of the files in use, otherwise the character may be mangled into two characters (as you can see happening with the two ?'s)

I'm closing this as a non-issue. if you can supply a complete reproduce case which proves that this is not simply down to the character set of the files, please add a complete reproduce case, which is repeatable, and re-open.

For support, please use the fw-general mailing list, or #zftalk on freenode IRC.

Fact: All is in one file and all encoding is UTF-8. And: It is _only_ the § character, when i use other like " or & or ß,äöü,µ it works fine
