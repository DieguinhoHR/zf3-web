This is not an issue because the Zend\_Locale\_Math\_PhpMath component does not provide a public API, and is not designed to work at all without first requiring Zend\_Locale\_Math (which requires Zend\_Locale\_Math\_PhpMath if, and only if, needed).

Regardless, if a developer did want to use the Zend\_Locale\_Math abstraction layer to work with unlimited precision math in their applications, then they should only require Zend\_Locale\_Math. These two components provide some level of support for deployment platforms lacking PHP's BCMath extension.

BTW, the round() in Zend\_Locale\_Math rounds correctly in many cases, where PHP's round() fails to produce mathematically correct results.
