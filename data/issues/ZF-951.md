### Description

Now that the DocBook 4.4 DTD is available at [http://framework.zend.com/docbook/xml/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/docbook/xml/4.4/docbookx.dtd), documentation should refer to this location in the DOCTYPE headers.

Resolved for core (not incubator, where experimental work currently continues) with SVN [r3575](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=3575)
