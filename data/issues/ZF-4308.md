This is more an error of Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl component as i understand. I re-assigned it.

Hello Alex,

i need some feedback on what you were doing. What class exactly did you return from your SOAP call? It seems the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract is returned from a SOAP result which makes no sense, so i assume you tried to return a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row or Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset class?
