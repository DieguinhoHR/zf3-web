### Description

Currently, the plugin broker sets the request and response objects for each plugin only when its own setRequest()/setResponse() methods are called -- which only happens at the beginning of the dispatch loop. This means that if you register a plugin after the dispatch loop has begun, it will not have access to the request/response objects. This is an issue, for instance, with the Layout plugin, which reads from and writes to the response object.
