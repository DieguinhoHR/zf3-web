### Description

I have the little configuration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $getopt = new Zend_Console_Getopt(array(
        'deamon|d=s' => 'deamon mode',
        'verbose|v'  => 'Generate verbose messages',
        'help|h'     => 'display this help and exit'
    ));


but I would like to allow a user call with unconfigured options like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    php myscript.php -v -a


This would nice to configure like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $opts->setOption(Zend_Console_Getopt::CONFIG_ALLOWUNCONFIGURED, true);
