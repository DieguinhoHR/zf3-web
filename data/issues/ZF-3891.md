### Description

In 7.9.3. Named Segments it is stated that:

"setBody() and appendBody() both allow you to pass a second value, $name, indicating a named segment. In each case, if you provide this, it will overwrite that specific named segment or create it if it does not exist (appending to the array by default)."

this is not right. If the named segment already exists the new content is appended to it. As of revision:

[http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Zend_Framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend/Controller/Response/Abstract.php?r=8168#l364)
