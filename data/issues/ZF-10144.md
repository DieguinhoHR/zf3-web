ZF-10144: Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader Doesn't Keep Track of Plugins that Fail to Load
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-07-13T01:28:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:43.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

In the docblock for Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader::getClassName() (lines 298-303) the return value is given as

"@return string|false False if class not found, class name otherwise"

indicating that the plugin loader should be keeping track of plugins that fail to load. This doesn't happen, because in Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader::load(), if the plugin is not found false is returned or an exception is thrown (lines 402 - 413) before the plugin tracking code (lines 415 - 419).

This could be resolved by putting the tracking code before the not found code.

I think a good idea would be to track the failed loads separately, so that failed loads can be tried again if a new prefix path was added. The number of new prefix paths added since a failed load could be tracked, and used to shorten the prefix paths to try in the loading code.

I'll put a file with my idea of a revised version of Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader::load() for the simple solution. The more complicated, more tracking one I'll put up later after I've had some time to check it :).

This will keep track of plugins that fail to load, but won't do any tracking to force the plugin loader to try again if a prefix path is added. I've got some code for that, but I want to check it a little more carefully than I can right now.
