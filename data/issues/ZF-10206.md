ZF-10206: Can't set value attribute for button element (and its not automatically set as with a submit element)

### Description

I can create a submit element to a form using something like ...

 
        $this->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
            'required' => false,
            'label'     => 'Submit',
        ));


... which will produce ...

This is as expected and the isChecked() function works as it checks the submitted value matches the element label (which is used to set the value as it happens).

However, the following ...

 
        $this->addElement('button', 'submit', array(
            'required'  => false,
            'label'     => 'Submit',


// 'value' => 'Submit', 'attribs' => array('type' => 'submit'), ));

... will produce ...

Submit

... without the value attribute being set, even if the commented line above is uncommented. You can even pass it in as part of the 'attribs' array and it appears to be discarded.

While this wont present an issue for _some_ versions of IE, most other browsers require the value attribute to be set in order for the isChecked() function to work.

At least, that is what I have concluded. I may need to be corrected, and am happy to be.
