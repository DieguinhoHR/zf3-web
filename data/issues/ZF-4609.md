### Description

$date1 = array('year' => '2008', 'month' =>'4', 'day' =>'13', 'hour' => '10', 'minute' =>'45', 'second' => '12'); $show\_date1 = new Zend\_Date($date1); echo $show\_date1;

return: 2008-04-13 10:45:12

$date2 = array('year' => '2008', 'month' =>'4', 'day' =>'30', 'hour' => '22', 'minute' =>'45', 'second' => '12'); $show\_date2 = new Zend\_Date($date2); echo $show\_date1;

return: 2008-05-01 22:45:12

I have set date\_default\_timezone\_set('Europe/Warsaw')

$date2 schould give me 2008-4-30 22:45:12 not 2008-05-01 22:45:12 !!!

This can impossible work... I get 2 times 2008-04-13 10:45:12 which is what I would expect from looking at this code.

With any version of ZF I tried, echoing the same object/string twice, results in two times the same output. Issue is not an issue...

Output not reproducable... prooved by two people.

PS: If you meant to output the second object (I believe you didn't try your code by yourself) it seems that you forgot to set the timezone.
