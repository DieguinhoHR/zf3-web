ZF-11024: Zend\_Measure\_Binary wrong number formatting
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-02-03T00:09:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-02-16T03:56:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

This code:

$usage = memory\_get\_usage(); $mm = new Zend\_Measure\_Binary($usage, Zend\_Measure\_Binary::BYTE, 'sr\_RS'); $mm->setType(Zend\_Measure\_Binary::MEGABYTE); printf('%s (%s) %s', $mm->toString(2), $usage, PHP\_EOL);

// Some memorry spent here

$usage = memory\_get\_usage(); $mm->setValue($usage, Zend\_Measure\_Binary::BYTE); $mm->setType(Zend\_Measure\_Binary::MEGABYTE); printf('%s (%s) %s', $mm->toString(2), $usage, PHP\_EOL);

Prints:

9.52 MB (9985196) 22,754,856.0 MB (22754856)

Isn't this 22,754,856.0 bad number representation?

The used number format depends on the set locale and the set format. It is correct. If you like to get an integer instead of a localized number use the getValue() method which returns you a plain number.

22 754 856 bytes = 21.7007217 megabytes

It should round it on 2 decimals, and it should be around 22MB, but it says 1000000 times bigger value.

22,754,856.0 MB (22754856)

You want to give and output all numbers localized to sr\_SR. But then you use printf as verification which itself is non-localized.

This can not work: A number like "12,000" will be interpreted as 12000 in sr\_SR. But in en\_US it would be interpreted as 12 (a floating value with a precision of 3).

toString() localized the output (as requested) but printf does not know about your localization-wish and works with the locale from your server (as it's a non-ZF method).

Therefor this issue will not be reopened.

Ah, ok, so printf is producing this format, thanks.
