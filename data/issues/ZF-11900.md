ZF-11900: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::ALLOW\_ALL does not match documentation

### Description

The manual for Zend\_Validate\_Hostname says: "For security reasons ALLOW\_URI is not contained within ALLOW\_ALL." This is not true: ALLOW\_ALL is 15, which does contain ALLOW\_URI (8). Additionally, the Docstring for both constants says the same: "Allows all types of hostnames".

Either the documentation is incorrect ot ALLOW\_ALL should be set to 7 to match the documented behavior.

I've attached a patch which updates this section of the manual to reflect the actual implementation.
