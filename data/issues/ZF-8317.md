### Description

At the moment Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu view has some shortcomings.

First of all, if you want to only render active branch, with setRenderParents(true), you can't render eg. ->minDepth(1), if the last active depth is 0; it won't find the corresponding branch to be active. This was fixed for \_renderDeepestMenu couple of versions ago, but the problem still persists for \_renderMenu:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($found = $this->findActive($container, $minDepth, $maxDepth)) {


The $minDepth should be $minDepth - 1 for this line, like it is in \_renderDeepestMenu.

Aside from this minor bug, there's also another shortcoming with the view helper. Namely you can't render a menu such that the siblings of the active branch are also rendered. Right now you can only render the siblings of the _deepest_ active branch.

For an example of such menu, take a look here: [http://mil.fi/rauhanturvaaja/perustiedot/…](http://www.mil.fi/rauhanturvaaja/perustiedot/valmius.dsp) It prints the active branch, but also all siblings of its parents.

I've added a new method to the view helper, called renderSiblings() (default by false to keep things backward compatible), that lets you do just this.

I know there's a similar suggestion posted here earlier (<http://www.zendframework.com/issues/browse/ZF-6941>), but there are some problems with it:

- It only checks the siblings of the deepest active branch's parent, this won't work if you render more than two depths of menu.
- I think the name "expandBranch" is misleading and unclear. We already have renderParents(), so I think renderSiblings() is the appropriate name for this.

Included is the patch with the changes in the view helper, unit tests and documentation. Hopefully you'll consider adding it!

I think, you can use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->navigation()->menu()->setOnlyActiveBranch()->setExpandSiblingNodesOfActiveBranch();
