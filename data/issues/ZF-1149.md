ZF-1149: Problem with describeTable method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

In line 129 of Zend\_Db\_Adapater\_Pdo\_Pgsql :

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ($schemaName) {
           $sql .= " AND ... n.nspname = ".$this->quote($schemaName);
    } 


this only occurs when the project is defined, what it makes with that the sentence sql has "..." causing the error. The correct one would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if ($schemaName) {
           $sql .= " AND n.nspname = ".$this->quote($schemaName);
    } 


without "..." to work.
