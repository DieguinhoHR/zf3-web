Initial script for PostgreSQL

I've added queue\_postgresql.sql as "postgresql.sql" I've also renamed queue.sql to mysql.sql to distinquish the db names.

Remaining: Oracle, SQLite.

Initial script for SQLite

I have added the SQLite script, however, I cannot add the above linked script, because it is not covered by the CLA (Contributor License Agreement)

current script for SQLite3 seems bad......!

I tried with sqlite3 (3.6.10).

"SQL error: table "message" has more than one primary key"

Checking with Matthew O'Phinney to see if this follows with Zend Policies...
