ZF-10272: Zend\_Rest\_Client shouldn't expect XML output
--------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Client's get() method uses Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result when returning a result from a rest request. Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result is hardcoded to use SimpleXML in its constructor.

This makes it impossible to use Zend\_Rest\_Client for rest servers that return json responses.

I've solved the issue with the following workaround:

// The next line has been changed to not use Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result for json responses if ($response->getHeader("Content-Type")=="application/json") { return json\_decode($response->getBody()); } else { return new Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result($response->getBody()); }

This way, Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result is not used when there's a json response.

While the above workaround will work for the majority of use cases, I would recommend to solve the real problem by making Zend\_Rest\_Client\_Result less content-dependent, or to have different Zend\_Rest\_Client\_[Json/XML/Raw]\_Result classes which are invoked based on the Content-Type header of what the rest server is returning.

We solved this issue by overriding the \_call method in a child class. A read a proposal by Hector Virgen on the mailing list, suggesting that we should make this pluggable. Detecting the content-type is also a good idea. Maybe we should work together on this?
