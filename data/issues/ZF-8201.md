### Description

Zend\_Registry is useful for storing arrays, but there's no API for accessing just some element(s) of an array. This means that the application retrieving values from the registry must retrieve the array and then manually traverse it.

$a = array('foo', 'bar'); Zend\_Registry::set('a', $a);

Pattern today: $my\_a = Zend\_Registry::get('a'); echo "at 1: " . $my\_a[1];

Desired pattern: $at\_1 = Zend\_Registry::get(array('a', 1)); echo "at 1: " . $at\_1;

This is a limitation of PHP, not Zend\_Registry. If you want to traverse array keys or multi-dimensional arrays, the best approach is to cast your array to a Zend\_Config object:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Registry::set('a', new Zend_Config($array));
    
    // retrieving:
    $at_1 = Zend_Registry::get('a')->{1};


This is a simpler notation than the one suggested, and fully supported already.

Zend\_Config is a neat trick, but I don't like that your solution still places the burden on the registry user. Wouldn't it be neater to cast to Zend\_Config on the Zend\_Registry side?

No. Some developers simply use Zend\_Registry as a data store -- and casting to Zend\_Config would break expectations, as they may actually be expecting to receive an array.

Until PHP allows array access to the results of function calls (not likely to happen until PHP 6, if ever), casting to a Zend\_Config object is your best bet if you want to access individual items in an array via the registry.
