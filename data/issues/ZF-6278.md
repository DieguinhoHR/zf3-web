### Description

Hi,

$validator = new Zend\_Validate\_EmailAddress();

if($validator->isValid($emailF))

If your adresse is toto.-@domain.com the validator will return true.

I suggest to improve the modification by replacing in EmailAdress.php file on line 168 the preg pattern by that:

 
        if ((strpos($valueString, '..') !== false) or
        (!preg_match('/^([A-Za-z0-9]+([-_.][A-Za-z0-9]+)){0,}(@)([A-Za-z0-9]+([-_.][A-Za-z0-9]+){0,}\.([a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/',$valueString,$matches))) {
                $this->_error(self::INVALID);
            return false;
        }
        $pos=strpos($valueString,'@');
        $this->_localPart = substr($valueString,0,$pos);
        $this->_hostname  = substr($valueString,($pos+1),strlen($valueString));


Regards and thank you for your effort on this powerful framework :) Nicolas Renardet

As strange as it may seem according to RFC822 that is a valid email address.

Yes maybe but you agree with that toto.@domain.com like tata-@domain.com are not valid address.. ? right ?

Well, you can configure your mailserver to accept all RFC822 conform adresses and route them to another address.

This means that such a email address can be accepted even if it looks wrong... but it is correct. Even if they are wrong for your mailserver, they can be acceptable for another mailserver.

The check conforms RFC and such email adresses can be valid as it depends on the settings of the used mail server.

Therefor we close this issue as "won't fix".
