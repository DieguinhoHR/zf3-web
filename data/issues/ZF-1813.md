### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mBio = new Litra_Model_Biography();
    $bio = $mBio->find('00916661186236002296');
    echo $bio->exists() // "0"


In database table row with Primary key 00916661186236002296 exists. From profiler:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT
        `biography`.`id_biography`,
        `biography`.`id_writer`,
        `biography`.`content`
    FROM `biography`
    WHERE
        (((`id_biography` = 00)))

If I run this code everything is ok:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mBio = new Litra_Model_Biography();
    $bio = $mBio->fetchAll(array('id_biography = ?' => '00916661186236002296'));

In MySQL the ZEROFILL modifier is only used for display. It is not used in storage. The value in the database is still simply the integer value 916661186236002296. You do not need to use leading zeroes for an integer value.

And you should not use leading zeroes for an integer value, because this is commonly interpreted as an octal number in most languages.

Since you're using BIGINT with Zend\_Db\_Table, you have encountered across code I wrote in ZF 1.0.1 to handle conversion of strings to 64-bit integer values. By using the leading 0, the value is interpreting the value as an octal integer literal. It stops at the '9' since '9' is not a valid octal digit.

Changes applied in revision 6012.

This should help support MySQL ZEROFILL integer format.
