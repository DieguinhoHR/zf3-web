ZF-11850: Infinite loop in DefaultComplexType
---------------------------------------------

### Description

The class Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeSequence does not allow the usage of recursive types. Similar to issue #ZF-5754 one cannot use child elements of the same type within a class. This issue occurs because DefaultComplexType::addComplexType calls "$this->getContext()->getType" which itselfs registers a complex type again. This causes an infinite loop and lets PHP crash.

This issue is easy to solve by making sure that DefaultComplexType::addComplexType registers the type to the context ("$this->getContext()->addType($type);") before it iterates through its properties.
