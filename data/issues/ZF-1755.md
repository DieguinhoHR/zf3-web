ZF-1755: Add ability to retrieve custom spreadsheet elements by name

### Description

Right now, the only way to look up a custom element in spreadsheets is to retrieve the custom elements array and iterate through it manually. This requires that users write a lot of extra code to do something common and breaks encapsulation.

To fix this, ListEntry::getCustom() should be expanded to enable users to request a custom element by name. The custom elements array should also be modified to index elements by name, improving performance and enabling users to retrieve elements by name using array notation (e.g. $listEntry->custom['foo']).

Assigning to myself, since this is something I've wanted to see implemented for a while now.

Attaching patch for this as ZF-1755.patch.

Originally I wanted to just change the index for the $\_custom array to use the columnName value, but I realized that this would break backwards-compatibility if somebody tries to retrieve a column by it's numeric index (which is probably not the best idea...).

Instead, I implemented a new array called $\_customByName that uses the new indexing method. There's several additional functions added on to support this behavior and make sure that malformed data doesn't get inserted accidently. The old $\_custom array is still maintained, just in case anybody wants to use it.

Ryan, would you please review these changes?

I've uploaded a new patch ([^ZF-1755\_v2.patch]) to correct Ryan's concerns (sent via email), as well as a few things I noticed myself:

- Added functions to remove custom elements.
- Noticed that a few unit tests weren't being run.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the $\_custom and $\_customByName arrays to get out of sync.
