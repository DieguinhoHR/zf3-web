ZF-3365: Describe usage of multiple date objects - performance

### Description

It should be described within the manual that you should always work with ONE single Zend\_Date instance instead of always creating a new instance.

It is much more performant to work with only one instance or two if needed, instead of 2000 for every database entry.

Can you give an example here?

No, because this is a notification from me to myself. I will not describe the problems multiple times.

Please wait until it has been added.

Addition useless...

Per default the creation of 2000 or even more objects is more cost intensive than iterating 2000 times through the same objects.

This sort of performance increasement is not notable to be documented as it's standard OOP behaviour within PHP.

Therefor closing this issue as non issue.
