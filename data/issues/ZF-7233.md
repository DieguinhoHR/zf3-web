### Description

Zend\_InfoCard\_Exception\_Abstract declared twice: {quote} if (class\_exists("Zend\_Exception")) { abstract class Zend\_InfoCard\_Exception\_Abstract extends Zend\_Exception { } } else { abstract class Zend\_InfoCard\_Exception\_Abstract extends Exception { } } {quote}

Proposed substitution: {quote} if (!class\_exists("Zend\_Exception")) { require\_once 'Zend/Exception.php'; }

abstract class Zend\_InfoCard\_Exception\_Abstract extends Zend\_Exception { } {quote}

This is intentional, as the Zend\_InfoCard component is shipped separately from Zend Framework as a whole and thus the Zend\_Exception class is not always available.

Well, but this is currently against the coding standard, and Zend\_Infocard could, just like the other standalone package Zend\_Amf, ship Zend\_Exception with it.

Also Zend\_Gdata is shipped as standalone package with Zend\_Exception and does not use such a switch.

I agree with Ben on this. Shipping Zend\_Exception with Zend\_InfoCard does neither hurt performance nor add significant size to the download, and keeping consistence with the other standalone component can't be too bad either. Violating the CS for something as trivial as an Exception class ain't worth it imho.
