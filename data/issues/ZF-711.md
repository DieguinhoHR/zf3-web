Here's some information about my environment:

PHP 5.2.0 (cli) (built: Nov 2 2006 11:57:36) Copyright (c) 1997-2006 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2006 Zend Technologies with Xdebug v2.0.0RC1, Copyright (c) 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, by Derick Rethans

PHP was bundled with XAMPP 1.5.5. PHPUnit 3.0.0 Operating system: Windows XP SP2 Running tests/AllTests.php from cmd.exe.

I also got the following Notice:

Notice: Undefined index: PATH in C:\\zf\\tests\\Zend\\Controller\\Request\\HttpTest.php on line 131

This appeared to be an issue of testing, rather than code -- evidently, 'PATH' doesn't exist in $\_ENV on Windows. I setup the tests to grab the first set key in $\_ENV and test against that. Please verify that revision 2603 fixes the issue.
