### Description

Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in /foo/library/Zend/Mime.php on line 151

We get this when we try to send email using Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Smtp. All settings are verified, e.g. the mail server works (and I can connect from the shell on the same server), settings (username, password) are correct, allow\_url\_open is "On" and so on.

I think this was recently introduced either with 0.9.1 or 0.9.2 as I recall this working.

Here is the code I use to send email.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               $cfg = array(  
                            'auth'     => 'plain',
                            'username' => 'foo',
                            'password' => 'bar',
                            'port'     => 25,
                );
                $transport = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp('mail.server', $cfg);
                $mail->send($transport);


Happy to provide more feedback and code if necessary.

Does this happen with all messages or only some? Can you provide a little more detail on how you construct a message, along with a message body that you know that fails?

It happens with all messages, here is how I get $mail:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->setSubject('Neuer Kommentar');
    
    $message  ='Es gibt einen neuen Kommentar auf Ihrer Homepage.';
    $message .="\n\n";
    $message .='Klicken Sie auf den folgenden Link, um zu dem Kommentar zu gelangen:';
    $message .="\n\n";
    $message .=$comment_url;
    $message.= "\n\n";
    $message.= "-- \nmail robot";
    
    $mail->setBodyText($message);
    $mail->setFrom('noreply@mydomain.de', 'Mail Robot);
    $mail->addTo($to_email, $to_name);


This is weird though, because the exact same code works in production. I was always thinking that this is a connectivity issue with the mailserver but I can not trace the problem. As I said in my initial report, the server is working and reachable from this web server. No connectivity issues what-so-ever.

Obviously all variables (such as $to\_email, $to\_name, $comment\_url, ...) are set.

Thanks for looking into it!
