ZF-2811: namespace changed to inputNamespace (see trackers 2280 and 2460)

### Description

I had options in zend\_filter\_input which contained more default namespaces. Upgrading to 1.0.4 broke my unit tests because of namespace becoming inputNamespace. I've changed the problem in my code. The docs should be changed or backwards compatibility should be kept.

Actually, "NAMESPACE" should never have been used, as it is a reserved word in PHP. See ZF-2280. What part of the documentation should be changed?

I think I see the BC problem: that the _value_ of the constant changed, rather than the name of it.

Still, we'd be breaking consistency of the constant values by changing the value at this point. Marking as won't fix. Please feel free to reopen with additional information, suggestions on how to fix. Patches and code speak louder than words. :)

yeah I wasn't clear it is the value that has been changed which broke apps. The docs here [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.filter.input.html) are to what I'm referring.

Bookkeeping. Assigning all resolved issues to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be those that are new and unreviewed.
