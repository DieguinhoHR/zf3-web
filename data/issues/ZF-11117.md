I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing any rationale for adding this patch. Running the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $ cd tests
    $ phpunit Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/AllTests.php


runs the tests fine, with no errors of any sort.

The tests directory is added to the include\_path by the PHPUnit bootstrap automatically, so the require\_once statements as currently present resolve correctly.

Feel free to re-open the issue if you can provide more details on why the patch is necessary (e.g., OS-specific problems).

bq. The tests directory is added to the include\_path by the PHPUnit bootstrap automatically, so the require\_once statements as currently present resolve correctly.

I see... I have run tests at the wrong directory ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    cd tests/Zend/Controller/Action/Helper
    phpunit --include-path /path/to/zf/library AllTests.php


However, require\_once statements are not defined consistently over test files. See for example tests/Zend/Controller/Action/AllTests.php.

We're working towards making this more consistent (ZF2 repo fixes all of this already). However, the recommended way to run tests is directly beneath the "tests/" subdirectory, as we're now using a phpunit.xml file, which ensures common setup and filtering. Regardless of the inconsistencies between different AllTests.php files, this approach works across them.
