### Description

Active Directory adds an additional string to the human readable datetime values. Not sure why it is this way but a couple attributes in particular do this; whenchanged & whencreated. Patch attached to modify the PREG pattern in \_valueFromLdapDateTime().

Still need to figure out how to handle the \_valueToLdapDateTime() method though.

OpenLDAP Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS([+-]NNNN|Z) ActiveDirectory Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.0([+-]NNNN|Z)

Patch to modify PREG pattern and $timezone array index.

Also, other datetime attributes stored in ActiveDirectory appear to be encoded and would need to be decoded via command line call on Windows. Need to research this further.

Some fields: badpasswordtime, lastlogontimestamp, & pwdlastset

Also, that patch is for Zend\_Ldap\_Attribute, did not specified anywhere else. Sorry
