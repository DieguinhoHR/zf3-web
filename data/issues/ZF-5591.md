### Description

Extensive profiling has shown that when requesting regular feeds, performance can be improved by a factor of 35 if the XML to object mapping is disabled. A longer term goal would be to re evaluate how we currently handle support for Gdata v2, especially since in a small script to fetch a feed from YouTube, roughly 70% of the time is spent checking for and dynamically registering namespaces for v2.
