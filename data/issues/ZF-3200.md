ZF-3200: chunked transfer encoding should be assumed when the message length cannot be determined in advance

### Description

It appears that all common user agents assume a chunked encoding if the Content-Length header is not present, even if a Transfer-Encoding header is not present. The HTTP 1.1 spec is a bit ambiguous, though this line is suggestive:

All HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities MUST accept the "chunked" transfer-coding (section 3.6), thus allowing this mechanism to be used for messages when the message length cannot be determined in advance.

Since the Content-Length header is technically not required, I think it makes sense to default to attempting to de-chunk the response when it is missing.

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

Hi,

The fact that clients must accept the "chunked" transfer encoding as the RFC states (and Zend\_Http\_Client does) does not mean chunked transfer encoding is to be assumed when no body length is specified. I don't see any ambiguousness about the description.

However, if you encountered a problem with a particular server, and you noticed other user agents work around this problem, it might be worth solving.

Can you point out a server or a method to reproduce this problem?

Thanks.

Any news on this? If there is no real problem, I will close this bug.

Hi,

No, I believe there is no real problem here. Close away.

Thanks, Keith
