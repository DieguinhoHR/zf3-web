ZF-5739: Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable cannot save serialized objects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable cannot save objects serialized with the PHP serialize() function.

If I take the following class:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Foo {
        protected $_bar;
    }


serialize it using the serialize() function and store it in a Session Namespace, I will be presented with a fatal exception.

The exception appears as such:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0


When I check my database I find that no row has been created. The PHP docs mention you should try base64 encoding the serialized data, but I'm unsure whether this is a bug at this stage. I have tested this on a Windows 2003 Server running IIS 6.0, MSSQL 2005 and PHP 5.2.5.
