ZF-7111: Zend\_Cache backward incompatible change

### Description

I've been using ZF 1.8.1 for a project, today I installed the 1.8.4 release and then my application failed to start. I'm using a cache resource in my application, and I've been using the static method Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File::getTmpDir() to find the path to temp directory, but after the upgrade I have this exception:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method Application\_Resource\_Cache::\_isGoodTmpDir() in /usr/share/php/Zend/Cache/Backend.php on line 177

I inspected the Zend Framework code and found out that in 1.8.1 release, the getTmpDir() was static method (as I've used it in my code), but in 1.8.4 this method is no longer static, and is calling the \_isGoodTmpDir() member method. I read the release notes of 1.8.2, 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 before this upgrade and there was no mention in changing Zend\_Cache API.

is it a permanent choice to make this method an instance method? because I'm using the getTmpDir() to configure settings of my cache object, before creating it. here is my code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
               if ( $backend['adapter'] == 'File' ) {
                    $cachePath = realpath( Zend_Cache_Backend_File::getTmpDir() );
                    if ( isset($backendOptions['cache_dir']) ) {
                        $cachePath = realpath( (string)$backendOptions['cache_dir'] );
                        if ( !$cachePath || !file_exists($cachePath) || !is_dir($cachePath) || !is_readable($cachePath) || !is_writable($cachePath) ) {
                            throw new Exception('cache_dir is not a valid readable/writable directory. check application configurations.');
                        }
                    }
                    $backendOptions['cache_dir'] = $cachePath;
                }
                $this->_cache = Zend_Cache::factory($frontend['adapter'], $backend['adapter'], $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);


so , if this method will not be static, I should first create a dummy Zend\_Cache object, and then use this method to find out temp directory for my real cache object. I think static approach was better.

you are right but if you don't set a cache\_dir the call to getTmpDir() is automatic

so your piece of code is useless, isn't it ?

yep! all my path validation and stuff are automatically done in Zend\_Cache object. thanks for clearing me out.

Is this issue still active now?

Issue was in how user used the component, or a refactored/unintentionally public piece of internal functionality. Not an issue for resolution within the source code.
