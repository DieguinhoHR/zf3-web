ZF2-427: InputFilter Factory + AnnotationBuilder does not allow elements with name="type"

### Description

Use case: Create a form with an element named "type" via the AnnotationBuilder.

Problem: The Specification(used by the Input Factory) is build in the AnnotationBuilder::configureElement() method. The element name will be the key of the spec:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    $name   = $this->discoverName($annotations, $reflection);
    //...
    $filterSpec[$name] = $event->getParam('inputSpec');


If the name is 'type' it will be handled by the factory as hint to a explicit InputFilter class.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    if (isset($inputSpecification['type']))  {
     $class = $inputSpecification['type'];
     //...
    }


The class creation will fail because $filterSpec = $inputSpecification.

Can you provide the classes (with annotations) you're using that recreate the issue, please? I don't have enough information in this report to try and reproduce accurately.

I wish I could provide just a snippet of code but I get this error while building my own builder (based on your annotationbuilder) to generate forms based on doctrine metadata. But this should be fairly simple to reproduce: It should fail if you're using @Annotation\\Name("type") on a random element.
