### Description

The Navigation Menu View Helper does not support templates making it extremely difficult to customise the output of the menu.

I have already created a patch which I use for every new release of Zend Framework successfully: <http://gist.github.com/539149>

The above link includes patch and usage, but not unit test.

Your patch puts too many HTML code in the navigation helper. The goal must be to reduce the HTML code in all navigation helpers!

This is a task for Version 2.

A rework for the output comes with version 2 and also more options to manipulate the HTML. The current template solution looks not very fine and does not respect the coding standards.
