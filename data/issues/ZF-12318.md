### Description

ServiceNet is Rackspace's term for their internal cloud network. Unlike traffic going through the public internet, bandwidth on this network - say between a web server and cloudfiles - is not charged.

Zend\_Service\_Rackspace\_Abstract does not provide any way for the developer to say they want to use ServiceNet, so all traffic will be charged. There should be a setUseServiceNet() method or similar.

Adds setServiceNet() method and modifies storageUrl property if set.
