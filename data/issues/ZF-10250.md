ZF-10250: Don't parse feed and return special result if feed is not modified

### Description

I use Zend\_Feed\_Reader with cache and HTTP conditional get. It would be very useful to have option with special result when feed is not modified as now I must check that all entries in feed are already parsed earlier (query to my db). I have my own solution in just "return true;" in if ($response->getStatus() == 304) { to stop any processing. But it would be useful to have an option "doNotParseAgain" (default disabled to keep BC) that will return something special in that case.
