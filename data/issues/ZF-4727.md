### Description

Hi,

in reference to Bug: ZF-3934

It woul be nice if i can delete cache with an OR condition. Example: $cache->clean(Zend\_Cache::CLEANING\_MODE\_MATCHING\_TAG\_OR, array('tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3', 'tagN');

At the moment only a AND condition is possible.

Thanks.

I think ZF-4681 can solve this issue also.
