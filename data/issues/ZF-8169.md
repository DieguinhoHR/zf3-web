### Description

My code: if (! ($this->\_cache->test ( $cache\_id )) { # generate data # save to cache # return data } else { # load data from cache # return data }

The problem is when data from cache is loaded I get the following Notice: Undefined property: VOKpiValues::$1962 in **/var/www/html/Zend/Amf/Parse/Amf3/Serializer.php** on line **469**

So the problem is only, when data is loaded from cache. "1962" is an object with some properties. When I disable error\_reporting "1962" is set to null.

Can you upload your zend amf endpoint and service also any flex code that shows what you are trying to do.
