Just realized that this has been exported to another repos. However, it should be communicated somehow that you have to include an extern repos in order to use a core component.

Have you installed ZendService\\ReCaptcha? It must be installed in order for that captcha adapter to work.

The repository is here: [https://github.com/zendframework/…](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_ReCaptcha)

You can add it to composer using the package name "zendframework/zendservice-recaptcha", or via pyrus using the package name "zendservicerecaptcha". Alternately, grab a tarball/zipball from the git repository, unpack it, and add autoloader configuration that will pick it up.

In case you haven't seen my previous comment, I think it would be helpful to explicitly catch this case and at least throw a customized exception. Thus, the developer will know he failed to install a dependency.
