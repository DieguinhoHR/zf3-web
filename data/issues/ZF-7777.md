### Description

Zend Amf DbInspector is able to connect to the database even if the wrong port is given in the connection information:

set\_include\_path(get\_include\_path().":/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/ZendFramework/library"); include "Zend/Amf/Adobe/DbInspector.php"; require\_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php'; Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::getInstance();

$inspector = new Zend\_Amf\_Adobe\_DbInspector(); print "hello ".$inspector->connect("Pdo\_Mysql",array("dbname"=>"test","username"=>"root","password"=>"root", "host"=>"localhost", "port"=>"8889"));

Does it connect on a different port? or are you getting an exception indicating it can't connect (due to a bad port)?

The mysql server is running on port 3306. However, even if I have the port 8889 on the connection string, I am able to connect to the database without getting an exception.
