### Description

It would be nice if it is possible to define default values for all or some of the defined options.

Example: $opts = new Zend\_Console\_Getopt(''); $opts->addRules(array( 'days|d' => 'number of days', 'verbose|v' => 'verbose', )); $opts->setDefaultValues(array( 'd' => 7, ));

Agreed !

Currently there is no way to tell default option. You can't use: - $opts->days=7 because \_\_set() calls parse() - $opts->setOption("days", 7) because setOption() as NOTHING to do with getOption() (!!! it should have been named something like setConfigOption !!!)

This is how I deal with default option:

$opts->parse(); if ($opts->days === null) {$opt->days=7;}

This works, but it is not as convenient as passing default values to Getopt. Also maybe the getUsageMessage() may (if implemented) print the default values.

You can also extend Zend\_Console\_Getopt and redeclare getOption($flag) as public function getOption($flag, $default) but: it won't work with $opts->days and it will force you to tell the default value everywhere where you need the option ! So it is not a good solution.

I definitely see value in allowing the setting of default values, though none of those solutions seem ideal.

I like the solution of changing getOption to: public function getOption($flag, $default = null)

and I see the downside of having \_\_get not have that default option, but the way you get request parameters works the same in Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Abstract L:235 where \_\_get (Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http) doesn't have the default variable option.

So, following that approach seems like it would be best.
