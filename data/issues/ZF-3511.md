### Description

When converting one measure to another with a precision higher than 2 the precision doesn't seem to be taken into account and digits after the "." are always zeroed.

$locale = new Zend\_Locale('en\_US');

$number = new Zend\_Measure\_Length(12.3456,Zend\_Measure\_Length::STANDARD,$locale); $number->convertTo('CENTIMETER',4);

echo $number->getValue(4);

returns: 1235.00

changing line 130 in Measure/Abstract.php to: $value = $this->getValue(4); works arround the problem.
