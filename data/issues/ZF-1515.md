### Description

Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http using basicAuth process should ask for an HTTP authentication ( \_challengeClient ) if no login/password were given in the previous request instead of relying on Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_Http\_Resolver\_File whitch throws an Exception.

actual Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // line 523
    if (count($creds) > 2) {
                return $this->_challengeClient();
            }


Zend/Auth/Adapter/Http.php suggestion

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // line 523
    if (count($creds) > 2 || empty($creds[0]) || empty($creds[1])) {
                return $this->_challengeClient();
            }

Fixed with revision 5182. Basic Auth now re-challenges client when username or password are empty.

Actually, revision 5222 is the correct fix for this issue. I mistakenly committed the wrong copy of the file in 5182, and just caught myself. I will commit back the logout() method that was in 5182 at some point later, after some more testing.
