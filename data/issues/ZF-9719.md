### Description

In documentation for Zend\_Validate, there's a tiny grammatical error in section "Using pre-translated validation messages". In the note under the sourcecode it should be:

"As translation adapter Zend Framework chose the array adapter" instead of "As translation adapter Zend Framework choosed the array adapter"

Just a tiny heads up.

Greetings, Rene
