### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http has many methods for extracting information about the HTTP request. I was surprised to not find a method to get an HTTP header, so I added one. This seems like it would be a useful thing to have in this class.

This patch adds a getHeader() method to Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http. This implementation is really basic; it's just meant to be a start.

Patch applied in revision 3066. I also wrote some tests for it.
