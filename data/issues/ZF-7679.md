ZF-7679: Subform name rendered incorrect when working with multiple levels of subforms

### Description

I am working with forms on Ajax.

I have the following structure:

MainForm WebSitesSubForm - websites WebsiteSubForms - websites[1], websites[2], ......

If i am creating the entire form, but i do just a

MainForm->getSubForm('websites')->getSubForm('1')->render()

the elements from the form are rendered with names like this

1['WebsiteSubForm-Element']

not like this:

websites['1']['WebsiteSubForm-Element']

I am wondering why the rendering doesn't actually shows proper elements name. I think is a problem of missing recurrence (is taken into consideration just parent form, not all the hierarchy).
