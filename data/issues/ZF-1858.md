### Description

Changing "public function handle(Zend\_XmlRpc\_Request $request = null)" to "public function handle($request = null)" is not critical, because type checking is also done by the following setRequest call. The other changes also don't seem to cause problems.

Patch follows:

I was against Zend\_Server\_Interface from the beginning, because it does not allow for type hinting, which would make implementations such as Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server (which predated Zend\_Server\_Interface) more complex (explicit checks in the code, instead of implicit checks via type hinting).

Won't fix.

Aeh, what? Your opinion is fine. But as the other components implement this interface, don't you think it is a really good idea to implement that in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server too? Just for the sake of completeness. And yes, you are right, the type hinting thing is pretty sad, but at the end it is a PHP fault (see <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=37854>). Not implementing Zend\_Server\_Interface in Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server would erase the possibility to have type-hinting for a consumer of Zend\_Server-implementations. I think this is a valuable argument.
