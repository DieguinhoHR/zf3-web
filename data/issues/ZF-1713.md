### Description

fw-all@lists.zend.com doesn't forward all emails it is supposed to forward.

It seems like I am only getting mails from a few of the lists it's supposed to forward (e.g. fw-db, fw-auth, fw-formats). It's missing fw-mvc for sure. Please check! Thanks,

Gunter

PS: Sorry if this is not considered a bug but I wasn't sure where else to put it.

Sorry all, I haven't heard back from the responsible person(s) who have administrative access to the mailing lists. I'll try again.

Should now forward fw-mvc too. Sorry.
