--------------------------------------------------------------------

 Attachments: - [ZF-10812.patch](/issues/secure/attachment/13543/ZF-10812.patch)
 
### Description

Zend\_Uri\_Http's getUri-method should not return the port if the scheme is http and port is 80, or if the scheme is https and port is 443.

To fix it, change Zend/Uri/Http.php on line 256 to: ```

I've attached a patch which includes the suggested modification, plus four test cases to reproduce the issue. PHPUnit testdox output: [x] Should not return port when scheme is http and port is 80 [x] Should not return port when scheme is https and port is 443 [x] Should return port when scheme is http and port is not 80 [x] Should return port when scheme is https and port is not 443

Some other components do appear to rely on this behavior, such as Zend\_Oauth:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1) Zend_OauthTest::testGetHttpClientResetsParameters
    Failed asserting that two strings are equal.
    --- Expected
    +++ Actual
    @@ @@
    -<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com:80</a>
    +<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>


Unfortunately, the change you've requested will most likely cause a bc break, and so will not be accepted in 1.x. I think this should be pushed up to 2.x for fixing (if the issue also exists there).

It may be a simple matter of correcting the tests, but I would like someone with more experience with this component (Zend\_Uri) to comment on that.

Okay. Here's my workaround for people who want to avoid this problem.

 
    <pre class="highlight">if (('http' == $uri->getScheme() && 80 == $uri->getPort()) ||
        ('https' == $uri->getScheme() && 443 == $uri->getPort())
    ) {
        $uri->setPort('');
    }

Could a member of the Zend Framework development team comment on this issue? Would changing this behavior be considered a BC break? After applying my patch, Zend\_OauthTest::testGetHttpClientResetsParameters fails as it relies on the "broken" behavior (see my earlier comment above). The test in question specifically tests for that case:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testGetHttpClientResetsParameters()
    {
        $client = new Test_Http_Client_19485876();
        $client->setParameterGet(array('key'=>'value'));
        Zend_Oauth::setHttpClient($client);
        $resetClient = Zend_Oauth::getHttpClient();
        $resetClient->setUri('<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>');
        $this->assertEquals('<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com:80</a>', $resetClient->getUri(true));
    }


Notice that it calls setUri('<http://www.example.com>') but asserts for [http://www.example.com:80](http://www.example.com)

Thanks!

Hi,

The fact that this breaks some tests is good, because this is a BC breakage and I would not introduce such a change until ZF 2.0 unless there is a good reason to do so. This bug is marked as "Minor" and I do not see any reason stated why this is causing real problems - I agree it's not pretty but is it really causing issues?

This issue is already addresses in the design of Zend\\Uri for 2.0 - If you want you are welcome to take a peek at the proposal (it actually points to a partial implementation you can checkout using git) at [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Uri+2.0+-+Shahar+Evron)

If you think there is a reason for BC breakage before 2.0, please elaborate.

Shahar,

I completely agree. It is more of an annoyance than an issue, and I can't think of any meaningful cases where having the default port number specified for http/https would cause an issue, as it is still a valid URI. I've closed the issue, as you point out that it's been fixed in ZF2's Zend\\Uri.

Change would cause BC break. Issue has been resolved in ZF2 Zend\\Uri
