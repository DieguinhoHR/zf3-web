ZF-5388: Zend\_Amf\_Server handles arguments wrong

### Description

The method \_handle(Zend\_Amf\_Request $request) of Zend\_Amf\_Server handles the passed arguments wrong when the message is of type AMF3 and sent via NetConnection.

Current source code Zend/Amf/Server.php line 306: $return = $this->\_dispatch($method, array($body->getData()), $source);

Since the bodies data is already an array containing all passed arguments wrapping them in another array is wrong and should be modified to: $return = $this->\_dispatch($method, $body->getData(), $source);

Else the number of passed arguments is always one - even if multiple arguments have been sent from flash - sincethe first argument is an array containing all arguments. In the following line 309 it is done correctly when dealing with only a different kind of method signature.

One minor note: $body->getData() could be replaced by: $message in both line (306 and 309)

hi, I'm not sure I understood well but it might be why I got something working with amfphp but not zend amf.

I'm trying to pass 3 arguments to a method: 1. a string 2. a array of string 3. a string

public function getDataWidthArrayParam($str1, $arr, $str2) { array\_push($arr, "a", "b", "c"); return $arr; }

and I get a: Error #2044: Unhandled NetStatusEvent:. level=error, code=NetConnection.Call.BadVersion

while the same php is working with amfphp.

Also, if I pass an array (to a method that is waiting for one array) and return it with some changes, I get:

with amfphp: result: [0] = 1 [1] = 2 [2] = 2

with zend amf: result: [0] = [0] = 1 [1] = 2 [2] = 2

Shouldn't I get a normal array (like amfphp) instead of an array of one element containing the array returned?

The issue exists whenever an array is passed in as a parameter. This issue exists whenever an array is used as a single parameter or if one of the multiple parameters is an array.

I'm having the exact same issue when I try to pass a ByteArray and a String together. I'm using 1.7.5. The same script works in AMFPHP 1.9.

Hi,

I have the same problems if 1 of the parameters is a Flex object (class Object). I 've updated to version 1.7.6 and the problem (with arrays and objects) still persists.
