ZF-3006: Zend\_Cache SQLite backend creates SQLite 2.x databases

### Description

Apparently, Zend\_Cache SQLite backend creates SQLite 2.x databases that most GUI tools fail to open them because they support only SQLite 3.x databases. Need an option to specify which version of SQLite database files to create (2.x, 3.x). Maybe, use PDO sqlite while creating the database file?

Further, under unix, the sqlite db file is created as a unix executable with the following privileges:

\_www : Read & Write staff : Read & Write everyone : Read & Write

Is this an issue with not being able to open the file in sqlite GUI tools?

Zend\_Cache\_SQLite is creating sqlite2 databases probably because it is using the library: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlite.php>

To create sqlite3 databases, it may have to use: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php>

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

I agree with you, this could be an option of the Sqlite backend

It would be great to use SQLite 3.x databases.

What I can not understand is why Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite makes native database calls when calls could be made through Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Sqlite. If I am correct, Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Sqlite supports SQLite2 and SQLite3 databases. Surely making calls on a Zend\_Db\_Adapter would make things more flexable?

I think Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Sqlite should be able to be constructed with a path to a Sqlite file OR a Zend\_Db\_Adapter. Although it might not be wise to use many other Zend\_Db\_Adapter types, the choice should be mine.

Hi,

I'm working on a Zend\_Cache refactoring proposal. This would handle all SQLite versions and php adapters.

Please take a look and tell your opinions.

PS: A native sqlite call is much faster and some sql's ( e.g. CREATE ) are not same on all databases ;)

This will be fixed in ZF 2.0 on using one of the installed extensions sqlite3, pdo\_sqlite or sqlite and/or based on Pádraic's [Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Database](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9437191) proposal.

Hi, did you noticed that in Ubuntu 11.10, support of Sqlite 2.x has been dropped down? It is true for the desktop version, and also for the server one. See, the issue in Launchpad: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/…](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5/+bug/875262)
