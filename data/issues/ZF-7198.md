### Description

I'm trying to feed Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::fetchRow() an instance of Zend\_Db\_Select (though that may not be the intension, it is what suites me), but unfortunately fetchRow() only checks if the $where param is an instance of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, by which it basically does: $this->select()->where('my full-blow-query') which leads to rather spectacular though unwanted results.

All in all; I'd suggest to change: if (!($where instanceof Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select)) { Into: if (!($where instanceof Zend\_Db\_Select)) {

For those interested; my query becomes something like: SELECT `recordings`.\* FROM `recordings` WHERE (�_�\_bind) AND (�_�\_adapter) AND (�\*�\_parts) AND (�\*�\_tableCols) LIMIT 1

Why woulnt you use the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select that you can get from the table you are attempting to query against?

I dont see the use case.
