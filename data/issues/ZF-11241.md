### Description

Hello ;

I want use my module view filters/helpers in a plug-in controller at the _predispatch_ point. Unfortunately, the plug-in loader linked to the view object has not my view helpers/filters paths registered at this point. I've tried to do the same in my action controller and then, the paths are available.

Question, why the modules paths (eg. view helpers and view filter) are not available at the _predispatch_ point ? It's a bug or not ? Of course, I can register the paths by hand but I think that these paths should be discovered automatically, and not just at the action point.

_To resume:_

In my plug-in controller, at "predispatch" point:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap')->getResource('view');
    echo '


    ';
        print_r($view->getPluginLoader('filter'));
    echo '

    ';

_Result:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Loader_PluginLoader Object
    (
        [_loadedPluginPaths:protected] => Array
            (
            )
    
        [_loadedPlugins:protected] => Array
            (
            )
    
        [_prefixToPaths:protected] => Array
            (
                [Zend_View_Filter_] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => Zend/View/Filter/
                        [1] => /var/www/imscp/site/themes/default/templates/views/filters/
                    )
    
                [iPMS_View_Filter_] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => iPMS/View/Filter/
                    )
    
            )
    
        [_useStaticRegistry:protected] => 
    )


_In my controller action:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo '


    ';
        print_r($this->view->getPluginLoader('filter'));
    echo '

    ';
    exit;

_Result:_

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Loader_PluginLoader Object
    (
        [_loadedPluginPaths:protected] => Array
            (
            )
    
        [_loadedPlugins:protected] => Array
            (
            )
    
        [_prefixToPaths:protected] => Array
            (
                [Zend_View_Filter_] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => Zend/View/Filter/
                        [1] => /var/www/imscp/site/themes/default/templates/views/filters/
                    )
    
                [iPMS_View_Filter_] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => iPMS/View/Filter/
                    )
    
                [Dashboard_View_Filter_] => Array
                    (
                        [0] => /var/www/imscp/site/application/modules/Dashboard/views/filters/
                    )
    
            )
    
        [_useStaticRegistry:protected] => 
    )


Like you can see here, the view filters path from my dashboard module is only available in my controller action. It's same for the view helpers path.

The expected result is like the last but at the plug-in controller _predispatch_ point.

Sorry for my english, I'm french.

Re ;

After a little research, it's seem that the paths to module filters/helpers are added by the _ViewRenderer_ action helper that is initialized when the action controller is instantiated and not before...

{quote} Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_\_construct() -- $this->\_helper = new Zend\_Controller\_Action\_HelperBroker($this); -- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer::setActionController($actionController); -- Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer::init(); -------Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer::initView() ... {quote}

So, the Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_ViewRenderer uses the module name as class prefix for helpers and views such that if the module name is 'Dashboard', it will set the helper lass prefix to 'Dashboard\_View\_Helper' and 'the filter class prefix to 'Dashboard\_View\_Filter...

This behavior explain why the specific view paths (filters/helpers) for modules are not registered in the plugin Loader linked to the view at the _preDispatch_ point since the action controller is instantiated later. Unfortunately, that mean too that we cannot use any of them at this point (eg. in plugin).

Of course, like already said, we can register them by hand but is a bit annoying in my opinion. We can not more use them at the _postDispatch_ point since the rendering process is already done. In fact, we can but in some case, that can pose some problems such as when we use the jQuery view Helper.

So, it seem that in your current vision, it's the expected behavior. Now, my question is simple: What's the better solution to have the modules view filters/helpers paths registered in the view plugin Loader at the _preDispatch_ point.

Thanks in advance for any answer.

No new because it's tagged as 'improvement' or ?
