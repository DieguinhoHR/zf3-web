### Description

Creating the client succeeds: $this->client = new Zend\_Soap\_Client('<http://server.com:10080/path/service.asmx?WSDL>'); A request fails: $response = $this->client->request($query); with "Internal Server Error"

However when I pretend I have a proxy: $this->client = new Zend\_Soap\_Client('[http://server.com/path/service.asmx/â€¦](http://server.com:10080/path/service.asmx?WSDL',array)('proxy\_host' => 'server.com', 'proxy\_port' => 10080)); The request succeeds: $response = $this->client->request($query);

I think this may be a PHP bug. If so, let me know, and I will report it there. Thanks!

Is your client running on the same server using the same port as your server?

I am not able to reproduce this bug so it's quite hard to say whether this is a bug or not.

Are you able to provide some more information?

Hello, I'm having the same problem. The response: SoapFault->message = 'Not Found'. I have used the same solution as Simon (pretend i have a proxy).

Issue appears to be a bug in PHP: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=30359>, apparently was fixed in 5.0, but still persists throughout. As noted above, "fix" is to send the request through a fake proxy.

Will test and confirm whether this matters if the soap client and server are local or remote.
