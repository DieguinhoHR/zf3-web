### Description

In the introduction of Zend\_Locale ( [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.introduction.html) ) there are two links to Wikipedia, pointing to the Localization and Internationalization articles. However, they both link to the same article.

The URL for the Localization link is correct, but the Internationalization URL should be <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L18n>
