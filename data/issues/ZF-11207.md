### Description

HI all,

Got a little blocker. new to the zend framework and so far i like it!

What i have done: - got a tool running that crawls the website and puts it in into a sitemap for google to pick up. - I use $doc = Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document\_Html::loadHTMLFile($item->loc, true); $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Text('link', $item->loc)); $index->addDocument($doc);

To build an index and with the true option in loadHTMLFile i can print the output with $body.

Unfortunatly the body IS what i need but not everyting. I would like to get the context within for exemple

 this is what i need to index 

and nothing outside that.

I've been search the internet for a solution for over 5 days, but nobody has the same issue because they all get it directly from a database. Is this even possible? and if so... is it documented?

Hope you guys/girls can get me into the right direction!

thank you!

This is not an issue with Zend Framework. Please send your question to the [appropriate ZF mailing list](http://zendframework.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Mailing+Lists) and someone will help you out.
