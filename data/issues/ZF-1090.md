ZF-1090: Remove "Zend" from the component list in the manual
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It's confusing to new users. Also, probably shouldn't rename it to "Zend Framework"--it's not a component.

Instead, put introductory text above the table of contents.

Also, why not just call it the "Zend Framework Manual" (instead of the "Programmer's Reference Guide")? The link on the navigation is called "Manual".

I suggest not to remove it, but rather rename the title on ZF's website to "Reference manual" (right column), and change the content of the Zend page. Ideal would be to write a little about what the Zend Framework is.

I'm willing to take this task on me, so Bill, you can assign the task to me if you are okay with it.

This is taken care of in ZF-1340.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
