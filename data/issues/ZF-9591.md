### Description

Two notices from Zend\_Translate\_Adapter, which don't exist on 1.10.2:

Notice: Undefined index: content in /home/\_library\_unstable/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 204

Notice: Undefined index: locale in /home/\_library\_unstable/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 205

Rows 203-210 from the file:

try { if (!($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate) && !($options['content'] instanceof Zend\_Translate\_Adapter)) { $options['locale'] = Zend\_Locale::findLocale($options['locale']); } } catch (Zend\_Locale\_Exception $e) { require\_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Translate\_Exception("The given Language '{$options['locale']}' does not exist", 0, $e); }

How do you call Zend\_Translate ? We need some information for a reproduction.

I use ini file with Zend\_Application, so it uses Translation resource:

here's my translate from ini file: resources.translate.adapter = array resources.translate.locale = fi\_FI resources.translate.data = APPLICATION\_PATH "/translations" resources.translate.options.scan = directory resources.translate.options.logUntranslated = false

additionally, I load module specific translations in my Bootstrap:

public function \_initTranslateModuleLoader() { $this->bootstrap(array("locale", "translate"));

 
        $translate = $this->getResource("translate");
        $locale = $this->getResource("locale");
    
        foreach ($this->modules as $module => $directory)
        {
            $translation_file = dirname($directory) ."/translations/{$locale->toString()}.php";
    
            if (file_exists($translation_file))
            {
                require_once($translation_file);
    
                if (isset($translations) && is_array($translations))
                {
                    $translate->addTranslation($translations);
    
                    unset($translations);
                }
            }
        }
    }

Fixed with r21770.

Note that the problem is related to Zend\_Application\_Ressource\_Translate which you are using and not within Zend\_Translate.

I use the following configuration:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.translate.adapter = csv
    resources.translate.data = APPLICATION_PATH "/languages/nl.csv"
    resources.translate.locale = "nl"


This results in (with and without the changes in r21770): {color:red} Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Translate\_Exception' with message 'Error opening translation file 'Array' {color}

I don't understand what this has to do with this issue. Here is a problem described with raised notices.

You mention a problem where Zend\_Translate returns that a file can not be opened. And you are using a different configuration as the reporter of this issue.

Please note that different issues should not be thrown together into one.

For default problems like described by you, please ask within our mailinglist or within our IRC channel.

After reading this issue I thought r21770 was supposed to fix problems between the improved Zend\_Translate and Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Translate.

I'm currently running a site on ZF 1.10.2 with the configuration I mentioned and without any problems. After upgrading to ZF 1.10.3 I got the Fatal error. I thought it had something to do with this issue.

I then applied the changes in r21770 but that didn't solve anything. So I assumed the changes you made weren't sufficient. That was a wrong assumption. Sorry for that.

Today I tried upgrading again and now the errors don't appear. So I probably made a mistake yesterday while doing the upgrade.

You're probably right that it would have been better to create a new issue. But next time I'll first make sure it's not me being stupid ;)
