### Description

I do not know if it's a bug, and I started to work with Zend Framework it's been couple of months only, so I am sorry if it's a trivial question. I've been having a trouble with file upload lately and did quite a lot of research about it. I used this tutorial [http://akrabat.com/zend-framework/…](http://akrabat.com/zend-framework/simple-zend_form-file-upload-example/) to create my file upload, I added certain things like filter(to rename the file) etc, and I needed multiple file upload so I added necessary changes for this as well as to send the uploaded files as attachments by email. Everything works fine when I call the form as

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    echo $this->form;


in view (index.phtml)

But when I want to call form elements separately, like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element = $this->elements[0]; // file element
    echo $this->form->$element->renderFile();
    
    $element = $this->elements[1];//submit
    echo $this->form->$element->renderViewHelper();


or simply

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->form->file;
    echo $this->form->submit;


The form elements are displayed correctly, but $form->isValid($\_POST) returns false and I get an empty array on calling $form->getMessages();

The reason i need to call upload elements one by one is that upload has to be a part of a bigger form for people to fill in and I should have a control over each element of the form.

I have a function getElementsNames() that returns an elements' names array and in controller I call $this->view->elements = $this->view->form->getElementsNames();

I thought the problem could be in decorators, but I do not reset decorators or do clearDecorators();

here is my form:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function init() 
    {         
    $this->setName('upload');
    $this->setMethod("post");
    $this->setDecorators(
    array(
    'FormElements',
    array('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'div')),
    'Form'
    }
    );
    $this->setAttrib('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');
    $file = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
    $file->setName("file");
    $file->setDestination('./uploads/');
    $file->addValidator('Extension', false, 'txt,doc,docx,pdf');
    $file->setMultiFile(3);
    $file->setValueDisabled(true);
    $this->addElement($file);
    $submit = new Zend_Form_Element_Submit('submit');
    $submit->setLabel('Upload');
    $this->addElement($submit);
    }


I apologize if my post is not very concise, it the first time I actually post something. Thankyou for your time.

Note that acrabats tutorial is using ZF 1.5 which is a little bit outdated.

This issue seems to be a coding request and no bug report. For generic help on coding issues please ask at ZFs mailinglist. For details on how Zend\_Form and its elements work you can refer to ZFs documentation.

When you have found a bug within ZF feel free to reopen this issue. Please give additional reproduceable informations in this case.
