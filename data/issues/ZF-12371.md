ZF-12371: ZendServer\_ShMem cannot be loaded on linux
-----------------------------------------------------

### Description

Due to the fact that linux has case sensitive paths, i cannot load ZendServer\_ShMem.

In Zend\_Cache::\_\_makeBackend\_ there is a call to Zend\_Cache::\_\_normalizeName\_. In Zend\_Cache::\_\_normalizeName\_ the capital M in ShMem is lost. This causes that the right file cannot be loaded.

As you noted Zend\_Cache::_normalizeName will lower case name of the backend/frontend you should also noted that this method concatenate words seperated by "-", "_" and "." and upper case the first character of each word.

-> Please name it zend-server-sh-mem or similar
