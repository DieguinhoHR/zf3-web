### Description

Two things make the use of the DateFormat view helper a little complicated.

1. I always need to pass the $dateType and $timeType since the defaults do not feed my needs. The NumberFormat and CurrencyFormat have setters and getters for $formatStyle and $formatType (NumberFormat) and $currencyCode (CurrencyFormat). I would love to have some setters and getters for DateFormat as well.
2. I need to pass a DateTime object to the DateFormat view helper. Passing just a date string like from mysql (YYYY-MM-DD HH:II:SS) does not output anything. I would love to have a check that could be added to DateFormat view helper that creates a DateTime object automatically when a date string is passed.
