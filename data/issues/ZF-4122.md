### Description

When trying to insert data into a table using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract -> insert() i get the following exception:

SQLSTATE[07001]: <>: -99999 [IBM][CLI Driver] CLI0100E Wrong number of parameters. SQLSTATE=07001 (SQLExecute[-99999] at /home/gawain/development/PDO\_IBM-1.2.5/ibm\_statement.c:732)

Using the profiler, i get the following information: query: INSERT INTO ACCOUNTS (name, email, password, register, noipchk, confirm\_code) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) query params: Array ( [1] => Gawalione [2] => me@email.de [3] => 8fb896791d481e821d1d9f39fa33fb4a913466c4 [4] => 1220039864 [5] => [6] => 7ba6480ac0bbdf82255f534cb3e5e04d )

My code is this:

class Game\_Db\_Table\_Account extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract { protected $\_name = 'ACCOUNTS'; protected $\_primary = 'name'; protected $\_sequence = false; }

 
        $account_table = new Game_Db_Table_Account();
        $data = array(
                'name' => $user,
                'email' => $email1,
                'password' => sha1( $password1 ),
                'register' => $registerTime,
                'noipchk' => $ip_chk,
                'confirm_code' => $confirmCode
        );
        $success = $account_table->insert($data);


[EDIT] Please ignore this issue, as i could resolve it myself. The exception from db2 lead me into a wrong direction and i thought the problem is within Zend, but there were some not null columns missing from the insert-data-array. I added them to the array and the insert works as expected.
