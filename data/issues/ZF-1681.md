ZF-1681: Add a method Zend\_Loader::namespaceLoad()
---------------------------------------------------

### Description

It would be nice to have a convenience method to loads a class, given the class base name, and a list of namespace prefixes. This kind of functionality is already used in Zend\_View to load view helpers and filters, and in Zend\_Filter\_Input to load filter and validator classes. I also needed this functionality in a class I was writing. So, to keep from re-inventing this wheel over and over, it seems like a good idea to just go ahead and add it to Zend\_Loader.

The attached patch file has a sample implementation that I've been using, which seems to work fairly well. I'm not married to the method name; change it as appropriate. The key points of this method to preserve: \* Takes a class "base name" and a list of namespace class prefixes \* Returns the full name of the first matching class \* Does _not_ instantiate the class, only loads/defines it (the calling code uses the returned name for instantiation)

Incidentally, this may help with ZF-1675.

I took a look at this proposed method, and tried to use it in both Zend\_Db::factory() and Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_getFilterOrValidator(). This idea needs to be explored more fully with respect to these use cases. There is no solution to declare the superclass or interface that the loaded class must implement.

This idea needs to be proposed in our proposal process, and show use cases and how the solution can be used to satisfy those use cases.

Resolving this issue as Won't Fix -- it should go through the proposal process.

I was unsure whether I needed to do a proposal for this. That's cleared up now. :) The patch was just quickly thrown together, to illustrate the idea; I'm not too surprised it didn't work outside my specific use case. :)
