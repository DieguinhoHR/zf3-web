### Description

Hello,

I'm currently using ZF to write an application but I randomly get these errors:

Notice: iconv\_substr() [function.iconv-substr]: Unknown error (12) in /library/Zend/Locale/Format.php on line 783

I tried to search for this issue but I only found references to 'Unknown error(0)' here. I can't seem to reproduce this issue, it appears to be completely random.

Is this a known issue? Is there a way to avoid it?

Thank you

First: What you receive is not an error, but only a notice. This means that the code still works properly, otherwise you should get an exception.

Second: What you are receiving is a failure from PHP's iconv\_substr method. And when even iconv\_substr notes that it does not know what error occured, I believe that ZF is not able to fix this.

I would propose that you eighter look at PHP's bug database if the PHP release you are using has a known problem regarding iconv.

And I would look if the iconv library you installed is outdated.

Try to upgrade iconv and php to see if the error remains... still I am sad to say that without any further information we can impossibly react or reproduce this behaviour.
