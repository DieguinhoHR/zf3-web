This is undocumented, but the expected behaviour when a translation object is set in the element.

A new feature allows you to ignore the value posted, which will prevent the value from being set in the object. Simply call:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $element->setIgnore(true);


and this will prevent submissions from overwriting the value.
