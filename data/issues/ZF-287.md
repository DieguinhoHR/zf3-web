### Description

_from the mailing list:_

I noticed that Zend\_Controller\_Action has a final modifier on the public run method. What I would like to do is this:

abstract class Lanalot\_Json\_Controller\_Action extends Zend\_Controller\_Action { public function run(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Interface $dispatcher, Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Token $action) { try { parent::run($dispatcher, $action); } catch(Lanalot\_User\_Exception $ex) { $response = array('error' => $ex->getMessage()); echo Zend\_Json::encode($response); } catch(Lanalot\_User\_Exception $ex) { Lanalot\_Log::logException($ex); $response = array('error' => 'A system error occurred.'); echo Zend\_Json::encode($response); } }

The reason why I want to do this is pretty simple. I have two exception types, user exceptions and normal exceptions. User exceptions are things like 'Invalid username or password', 'That field value is too long', etc. Normal exceptions include everything you don't want a user to see, like 'Unable to connect to the db' kind of exceptions.

I would really like to be able to make 3 of these classes, one for Json web service controllers, one for Xml web service controllers and one for xhtml web pages.

I understand this may not be the best approach, but I chose to try this because the controller can easily be made to only handle one type of request (xhtml, json, xml, etc). Trying to catch it futher down the line becomes problematic because I wont know why type of controller I am working with. I am open to other suggestions though.

I guess my main question is why is the run method final?

Reassigning from Jayson to Bill Karwin, pending further triage.

run() was deprecated in the MVC rewrite, and is only used when utilizing the action controller as a page controller; it is no longer a final method.

Please use the MVC version in the incubator, either from the 0.2.0 release or subversion.
