### Description

There is a method Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function getLabel()
        {
            if (null === ($element = $this->getElement())) {
                return '';
            }
    
            $label = $element->getLabel();
            $label = trim($label);
    
            if (empty($label)) {
                return '';
            }
    
            if (null !== ($translator = $element->getTranslator())) {
                $label = $translator->translate($label);
            }


When

 
    <pre class="highlight"> is called the element asks his translator to translate the label. But this is also done by


a bit later. We have two calls to translator instead of one.

I did search but got no relevant results by the keyword I entered... Glad to hear you have already put the issue into task queue.
