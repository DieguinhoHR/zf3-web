### Description

Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count fails if you set a new file destination _after_ isValid is called, and then call isValid again.

An example will better illustrate:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    define('UPLOADS_PATH', '/path/to/uploads');
    
    class Bug_Form_FileCountValidator {
        public function init() {
            $this->addElement('file', 'uploadElement', array(
                'label'         => 'Label text',
                'valueDisabled' => true,
                'validators'    => array(
                    array('Count', true, array('max' => 1))
                )
            ));
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    $form = new Bug_Form_FileCountValidator();
    $form->uploadElement->setDestination(UPLOADS_PATH);
    
    if ($form->isValid($_POST)) {                       // A
    
        // set a new destination
        $form->uploadElement->setDestination(UPLOAD_PATH . '/newpath');
    
        $uploadElement->receive();                      // B
    }


- The validation error message we get is: "Too many files, maximum '1' are allowed but '2' are given"
- isValid is called twice on: A & B.

A quick look at Zend\_Validate\_File\_Count and you can see that by setting a new destination _after_ isValid is called, it causes the file count validator to _add_ another file reference to its count when isValid is called again with a new destination. However, two files don't actually exist, we have simply changed the destination of the file that the file count validator already knows about.

I hope that makes sense?
