### Description

Sometimes, when using the insertEntry method to upload a video to youtube, I get an exception "Invalid Request", but the video is actually uploaded succesfully. This is obviously inconsistent: if the video was uploaded succesfully, no exception must be thrown, while if the request is invalid, then the video wouldn't be uploaded.

However wrong the request may be, giving a negative response and at the same time satisfying the request is buggy behavior.

I'm not sure whether the bug is actually in the library, or in YouTube's API itself, if it is actually returning a response saying "invalid request" and at the same time accepting and publishing the uploaded video.

Unfortunately I can't provide a series of steps to reproduce the issue: this just seems to happen randomly.
