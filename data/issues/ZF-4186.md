### Description

findDependentRowset() has a lot of smart logic that might also be usable in subqueries. Unfortunately, you can't get the built Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, but only the rows it returns.

I propose moving all but the last line (fetchAll()) of findDependentRowset() to a method like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    and modifying the findDependentRowset() function to:


public function findDependentRowset($dependentTable, $ruleKey = null, Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select $select = null) { $select = $this->selectDependentRowset($dependentTable, $ruleKey, $select); return $dependentTable->fetchAll($select); } ```

This way you could get the query without actually running it.

The same would probably also apply to other relationship-based functions.
