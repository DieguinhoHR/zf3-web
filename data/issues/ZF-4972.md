### Description

This issue relates to the Zend\_Pdf\_Page constructor issue, but surrounds the problem of creation of PDF related objects in general.

Zend\_Pdf::newPage Zend\_Pdf\_Page::\_\_construct

both have different creation strategies and work with $param1, $param2,... variables which hide the true usage in an IDE with autocompletion.

Hard to implement, since all params have general meaning.
