### Description

Amazon has many APIs, and while ZF can't possibly have classes to handle all of them, the base Abstract class should be able to help propel someone in the correct direction. Currently the constructor to the class requires the user to specify a valid EC2 region... This blocks the reuse of this abstract class for anything but EC2... I think instead having the user specify a region and API would be better...

So if a user picks EC2 and US, then it sets it up internally correctly...

Actually, it looks like the original intent of the abstract class goes along with what I mentioned above.. Somewhere in the EC2 implementation it got changed.. <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-5791>
