### Description

Hi, I'm basically working on Magento that uses the Zend framework. In the version of Magento that uses Zend version 1.5.1, the Indian currency (INR) is correctly displayed as Rs. However, when I moved to a new version of Magento that uses Zend 1.7.2, the currency appears as Rp (instead of Rs.). While searching for this I came across ZF-6208 wherein there is a note that : For the locale en\_IN, the currency INR is defined with the currency sign "Rp". Any help in expediting a fix for this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

ZF 1.9 uses latest database from Unicode. See unicode.org/cldr for details.

For the english language the sign for the currency INR is "₨"... note that this is not a R and a p but one single unicode character which reads ₨.

You should also note that the sign depends ALWAYS on the used language. For english the sign of IRN is ₨ For kannada the sign of IRN is रु and so on. It differs for languages and regions.

Still, when you need to have another sign feel free to set the currency string to use manually. Look into the manual for Zend\_Currency to see how this can be archived.

Please note additionally that Magento is not part of ZF and will therefor not be supported by us.

Hi Thomas, Thanks for the note and the link to unicode.org. The main issue is that the currency sign for the INR is Rs and so I created a bug at the unicode site (bug id 2239). They have apparently fixed it in the latest 1.7.1 release. You can see the diff here : [http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/bugdiffs.pl/…](http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/bugdiffs.pl?id=2239&ignore_attic=on) Is there a way to let me know when you will be releasing with 1.7.1? Is that even necessary or can I just use the latest xml files? Thanks a lot.

Cheers --Param
