### Description

When developer has his own loader class and uses it (for example My\_Loader) there is no possibility to use it in Zend\_Db\_Table and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset to load custom rowset and row classes. Now developer needs to override in extended class WHOLE fetchRow and createRow methods of class Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, and change only one row in this methods for example from: @Zend\_Loader::loadClass($this->\_rowClass); to: @My\_Loader::loadClass($this->\_rowClass);

Is it possible to have some method setLoaderClass (similar to setRowClass and setRowsetClass)? Or is it possible just to check somehow if registerAutoload class already registered and use already registered loader class?
