### Description

The execute() method in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Mysqli assumes that all statements return a result set, and therefore arrays need to be initialized to receive rows fetched from the result set. This is not appropriate for statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, etc.

Please set up result set arrays in this method only if the statement will return a result set.

Fixed in revision 3639, which means it was included in version ZF 0.9.0.
