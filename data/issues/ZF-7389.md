### Description

In manual i read this:

Phrases can also contain gaps or terms in the same places; they can be generated by the analyzer for different purposes. For example, a term can be duplicated to increase the term its weight, or several synonyms can be placed into a single position.

But when i do this:

$query = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Phrase(); $query->addTerm(new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term('word1'), 0); $query->addTerm(new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term('word2synonyms'), 0); $hits = $index->find($query);

Result is zero.

I stumbled over this, too when doing ZF-7738.

That patch also changes Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Phrase to handle multiple alternatives for a single position.

Gaps in a phrase were already supported AFAIK, so that should be no problem.

If ZF-7738 gets incorporated, this bug should be fixed, too.
