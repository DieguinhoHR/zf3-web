### Description

As per: [http://nabble.com/New-controller-comments-question…](http://www.nabble.com/New-controller-comments-questions-tf2620325s16154.html#a7758151)

the $this->\_redirect($url) should inject into the response object header instead of doing its own thing.

Also, it would be nice to be able to set the default Location status type for the application. For example, I like to use 303 location redirects as i like to implement a pattern of application response close to the POST-REDIRECT-GET pattern...

similar to : [http://theserverside.com/tt/articles/…](http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=RedirectAfterPost)

ideas?

marking this as an improvement, not but as functionality is currently provided in raw form via the setHeader() method

Resolved in 2770.

\_redirect() now uses the response object's setRedirect() method, which takes an optional HTTP response status code. After setting the redirect, it sends the response and exits.
