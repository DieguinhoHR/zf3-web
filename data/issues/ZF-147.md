ZF-147: Need getConnection() to create and return connection even if no query has been issued

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query() uses prepare() and statement->execute() to execute SQL statements. This can't execute statements like CREATE DATABASE ... using PDO adapters and results into an exception:

PDOException - HY000 - SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2030 This command is not supported in the prepared statement protocol yet.

(Using PDO::query() results in the same exception.)

Using this workaround

$db = Zend\_Db::factory('pdoMysql', $dbParameters); $db->query('SET @dummy=42'); $db->getConnection()->exec('CREATE DATABASE ...');

I can execute such a statement. But, I need this dummy query (second line) to open the connection because \_connect() is a protected method.

I suppose to extend Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_(Pdo\_)Abstract by the an exec() method calling (PDO's) exec() and a public methode to open the connection or getConnection() to return an open connection.

(My main reason to use an database abstraction layer is not to change easily to an other DBMS, but to be able to use some nice fetch methods ... Maybe you won't implement exec(), but to get an open connection without using a dummy query would be fine.)

Since Db/Abstract.php already provides public access to the underlying connection in public function getConnection(), why not also make protected function \_connect() in Db/Pdo/Abstract.php public?

If no one provides reasons why getConnection() should be private, or \_connect() shouldn't be public, then expect these changes in 0.1.5, and a public wrapper for PDO's exec().

In my opinion it would o.k. if getConnection() calls \_connect().

Delayed due to lack of input and feedback.

A simple solution is to always use getConnection() to utilise the connection inside and outside the classes. Then give getConnection() a bit of smarts. ie: function getConnection(){ if (!$this->\_connection) { $this->\_connect(); } return $this->\_connection; }

Now getConnection() will always provide a connection or die trying ( actually throw an exception.) no more calls to \_connect() in random places. They are splattered all over the db code. no tests for connection.eg  
 public function listTables() { if (!$this->\_connection) { $this->\_connect(); } ....

getConnection can be over-ridden to provide a connection from some other place eg. Registry.

Cheers, Gerrit.

Resolved in revision 3287. The getConnection() method tries to initiate the connection if it has not already been done. Thus you can use getConnection()->exec() even if no other queries have been run prior.

Restating summary.
