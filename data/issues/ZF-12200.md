### Description

PHP 5.3.8, Windows 7 64bit, PHPUnit 3.4.15

 
    <pre class="highlight">There were 2 errors:
    
    1) Zend_Http_UserAgentTest::testDeviceClassNameMatchesDesktopTypeIfUserAgentDoesNotMatch
    RuntimeException: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected $end in - on line 106
    
    2) Zend_Http_UserAgentTest::testAllowsPassingStorageConfigurationOptions
    RuntimeException: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE, expecting ')' in - on line 106

I suspect that it is caused by some issues with serialization, because they are set to runInSeparateProcess.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * @runInSeparateProcess
     */

They were added in r24694:

Author: matthew Date: 21. 3. 2012 23:09:32 Message: Removed WURFL UserAgent adapter

I suggest removing them (in the patch), because tests pass when --stderr switch is used.
