### Description

Zend\_Date is returned from most date methods without any modification to its default options. The existence of the static options means global settings apply at all times - this should be noted to indicate that Zend\_Feed\_Reader does not alter any such options, and the options used are only those set by the end user.

If a documentation is mentioned, can you Pádric, take a look at ZF-9622? I think ZF-9622 is badly assigned and you can solve these one quickly :)
