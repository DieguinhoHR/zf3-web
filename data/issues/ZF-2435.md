### Description

There has to be a way to remove some module controller dirs. This is complimentary method to addModuleDirectory(). The purposes can differ, but the most vivid imho is that it can be usde in such way. Imagine you have three modules: default, dashboard and admin. So you've added them using addModuleDirectory(). Now you want to easily deny requests of non-administrators to admin module, so you just have to add something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (!$user->isAdmin()) {
        $front->usetModuleDirectory('admin');
    }


Here is my version of this method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Remove specified module's controller directory.
         *
         * @param string $module
         * @return Zend_Controller_Front
         */
        public function unsetModuleDirectory($module)
        {
            if (isset($this->_controllerDir[$module])) {
                unset($this->_controllerDir[$module]);
            }
            return $this;
        }

Scheduling for 1.5 and prioritizing as minor

Added 'removeControllerDirectory()' to both front controller and dispatcher in trunk (in line with other method names); accepts a module name as the argument and returns true if the module was found and removed, false otherwise.
