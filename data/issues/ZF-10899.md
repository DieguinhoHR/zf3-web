ZF-10899: The use of "and" gives inconsistent search results

### Description

Don't know the version, but I updated 6 months ago.

This is what happens:

When I search with "call and wens" it won't return any results - query = +(call) +(wens) When I search with "call\* and wens" it does return 3 results - query = +(call_) +(wens) When I search with "call and wens_" it does return 3 results - query = +(call) +(wens\*) When I search with "call and wens and een" it does return 3 results! - query = +(call) +(wens) +(een)

The sentence it searches in goes like:

"Een call die resulteert in een wens moet de status wens ingestuurd krijgen".

I have tested with more searchs phrases using the operator "and" but I cannot see the logic behind the found results. Sometimes when I add \* to one word it finds the expected results and sometimes when I add an extra "and" statement it finds results (as expected) instead of totally none.

Can you tell me where to find the version info so I can update this bug(?).
