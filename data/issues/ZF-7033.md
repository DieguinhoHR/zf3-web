### Description

[http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceServ…](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/)

You have until August 15, 2009 to authenticate requests sent to the Product Advertising API. After August 15, 2009, messages that aren't authenticated will be denied.

The current interface $amazon = new Zend\_Service\_Amazon($appId, $countryCode); should be like $amazon = new Zend\_Service\_Amazon($appId, $countryCode, $appSecretKey);

this should help [http://mierendo.com/software/aws\_signed\_query/](http://mierendo.com/software/aws_signed_query/)

i confirm the problem,

In order to do this evolution:

- add a new parameters with the secret key
- modify the \_prepareOptions L194 in Zend/Service/Amazon.php

I'll look into it for 1.9

Fixed, will be included in 1.9 release

I've been checking out the (supposedly feature-frozen) 1.9 beta, and have noticed that some of the Amazon APIs are authenticating requests, but that the obvious Zend\_Service\_Amazon class itself is not. I see the changes in the trunk, however. Are these not to be included in the final 1.9 release after all? Did we miss the feature-freeze?

hm, thats not true. i merged it into 1.9 release branch, see yourself [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.9/library/Zend/Service/Amazon.php)

Ah, I see. I was (erroneously, I guess) looking here, at the 1.9.0 beta 1 release tag: [http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/…](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/tags/release-1.9.0b1/library/Zend/Service/Amazon.php)

Thanks for your work, however! It's much appreciated!

Maybe I misunderstood the Amazon API but since today I receive errors on every 5th request, as they started to reject randomly unsinged request to test the new singature. After analysing the funciton "\_prepareOptions" I found out the options are sorted alphabetically but not the option "signature" which will be added afterwards. Since I added "ksort($options);" again, there are no more errors!?
