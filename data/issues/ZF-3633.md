### Description

In the included openID Auth Adapter there is no possibility to tell the Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer object which Zend\_Http\_Client object should be used.

There should be a setter in Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId which enables you to init a Zend\_Http\_Client object which is used then. This is necessary if for example a proxy needs to be used.

Alternativly it could be done in constructor of Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer like the storage does.
