### Description

In latest api documentation, there's an error on Zend\_Version::compareVersion which states twice 'return 1' instead of 'return 0 and return 1'. Cf. screenshot.

It's strange because when looking at the code, documentation written in Zend/Version.php is correct, it's only api doc generated with phpDoc which looks like having this problem.

Cheers, Remy

It seems it's a problem with documentation build tool. Dockblock is correct, but '0' is interpreted as enumeration starting.

Checked with latest build available online under <http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/>. This failure is no longer seen.
