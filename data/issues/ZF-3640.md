### Description

The following code does not successfully set the Album's access to public:

 
    $service = Zend_Gdata_Photos::AUTH_SERVICE_NAME;
    $user = WT_PICASA_USER;
    $pass = WT_PICASA_PASSWORD;
    // Create an authenticated HTTP client
    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($user, $pass, $service);
    $gp = new Zend_Gdata_Photos($client);
    $albumEntry = new Zend_Gdata_Photos_AlbumEntry();
    $new_access = $gp->newAccess();
    $new_access->text = 'public';
    $albumEntry->setGphotoAccess($new_access);      
    $createdAlbumEntry = $gp->insertAlbumEntry($albumEntry);


The following code show it is still set to private and when using Picasa Web, the album is not in the Public Gallery and is market Unlisted.

 
    echo "createdAlbumEntry = " . $createdAlbumEntry->getTitle() . ' ' . $createdAlbumEntry->getGphotoAccess() . "\n";

This is a server-side issue in the PWA API service. This is not an issue with the client library code in Zend Framework.

Filed bug as: [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/â€¦](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=647)
