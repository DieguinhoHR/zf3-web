ZF-11368: Zend\_Db\_Statement should declare interface methods abstract

### Description

I often look at Zend\_Db\_Statement and do not see, in the code or the code-generated documentation, mention of a few methods because they are implemented by inherited classes. Coincidentally, these are documented in the interface, but I rarely remember to look there, since I'm not implementing an adapter, I'm using the Zend\_Db\_Statement API. Could we add the few missing interface-required functions to Zend\_Db\_Statement as abstract methods, in particular fetch(), which always bites me?

Here's a patch that adds the abstract methods to the class, with documentation copied from Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Interface. Unrelated, I noticed getDriverStatement() has a weird docblock.

Actually, we can't -- due to a limitation in PHP.

When you implement an interface, you _must_ define the methods, even if the class implementing it is marked as abstract.

As an example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    interface Command
    {
        public function execute();
    }
    
    abstract class AbstractCommand implements Command
    {
    }
        abstract public function execute();
    
    class DoSomething extends AbstractCommand
    {
        public function execute()
        {
            echo "Hello!";
        }
    }
    $c = new DoSomething();
    $c->execute();


will result in this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected T_PUBLIC, expecting T_CLASS


It does not matter where you put "abstract" in the function definition; you'll get some parse error. The only way to get around the situation is to either (a) define it as an empty stub (or throw an exception indicating "not implemented"), or (b) omit it from the abstract definition.

We've chosen (b) as PHP properly notifies you if the method is missing.

Sorry, I didn't know about this problem in PHP. Thanks for explaining it. I checked and this is possible in Java. The actual error from PHP should be, "Fatal error: Can't inherit abstract function Command::execute() (previously declared abstract in AbstractCommand)". This means PHP internally declares interface methods as abstract, since you get the same error if you change the Command interface to the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    abstract class ACommand
    {
       abstract public function execute();
    }


This has been reported as a bug 5 times, but sadly has been marked as "bogus" 4 times. Hopefully, it will be fixed.
