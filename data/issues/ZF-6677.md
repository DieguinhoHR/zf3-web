### Description

The ip address is checked for validity before checking if it's allowed. This does not make much sense to me. If it's not allowed, it doesn't matter whether it's a valid ip address or not

current code:

 
        // Check input against IP address schema
        if ($this->_ipValidator->setTranslator($this->getTranslator())->isValid($valueString)) {
            if (!($this->_allow & self::ALLOW_IP)) {
                $this->_error(self::IP_ADDRESS_NOT_ALLOWED);
                return false;
            } else{
                return true;
            }
        }


proposed code:

 
        // Check input against IP address schema
       if (!($this->_allow & self::ALLOW_IP)) {
                $this->_error(self::IP_ADDRESS_NOT_ALLOWED);
                return false;
        }
    
        if ($this->_ipValidator->setTranslator($this->getTranslator())->isValid($valueString)) {
                return true;
        }

ah.. This goes along with the parent issue I guess. The reason it's inside of the isValid() check is because that's how we're determining that it's an ip address. Maybe I'm just unaware of how involved testing that a string is an ip address is. I was assuming it could be done with a simple regular expression

Marked as fixed as the parent issue is already fixed for the next minor release.
