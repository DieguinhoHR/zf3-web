### Description

Hello,

I encounter a problem sending error log by mail in text format, these mails countain files paths and the colon character seems to be problematic.

A simple example :

$mail = new Zend\_Mail;

$mail ->addTo('email@domain.ext') ->setSubject('subject') ->setBodyText('C:\\path\\to\\filename.ext') ->send();

The content sent is :

Date: Sat, 19 Nov 2011 05:32:14 +0100 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Content-Disposition: inline MIME-Version: 1.0

C:\\path\\to\\filename.ext

The ':' character carries a misinterpretation of the text body as a header, so the body of the mail isn't visible (at least in GMail and Outlook), the correct content must be :

Date: Sat, 19 Nov 2011 05:32:14 +0100 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Content-Disposition: inline MIME-Version: 1.0

C=3A\\path\\to\\filename.ext

...with a '=3A' in place of ':', I add a correction on my side in the file Zend\\Mime.php at line 73 :

 
        "\xFF","\x3A"


...and line 97 :

 
        "=FF","=3A"


Best regards, Cédric Tailly
