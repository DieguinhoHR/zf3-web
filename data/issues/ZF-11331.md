### Description

Zend\_Oauth test suite lacks proper docblocks. This makes testing Zend\_Oauth as a standalone component difficult (ie: ./runtests.sh Oauth does not work)

Added patch which adds following: - File-level docblock - Class-level docblock with proper @group declarations

Test suite passes after changes applied
