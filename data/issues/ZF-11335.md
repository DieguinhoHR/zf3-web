ZF-11335: Wildfire does not send exception code
-----------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2011-04-30T06:27:01.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-04-30T17:36:35.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When sending variables, Wildfire detects variable type and sends particular properties of an exception (Class, Message, File, Line, Type and Trace). It does not however send the exception code.

Suggest that in Zend/Wildfire/Plugin/FirePhp.php line 406 add new line:

 
                         'Code'=>$var->getCode(),


This should have no adverse impact but ensures the Exception code is sent when an exception is sent using wildfire.

Change tested in $Id: FirePhp.php 23775 2011-03-01 17:25:24Z ralph $

Sounds reasonable. If you can provide a patch with test I can get this in faster. The test should verify that the 'Code' is present in the response headers. I presume FirePHP correctly displays this code in the UI if present?
