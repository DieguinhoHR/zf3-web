### Description

Currently, PartialLoop checks to see if $model implements toArray(), and, if so, uses that method to cast to an array. However, this is not always the desired behavior -- in the case of a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset, the developer may want to pass the individual rows as objects to the partial, allowing the ability to call methods on it.

The behavior should be changed; if the object implements Traversable, PartialLoop should simply iterate over it.
