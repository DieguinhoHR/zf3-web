ZF-4006: Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Checkbox works incorrect
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-08-20T01:18:13.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-09-02T10:38:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.6.0 (02/Sep/08)

### Description

Here is example: <?= $this->checkBox( "checkBoxName", '0', //current value array(), array(), array( 'checkedValue' => '1', 'unÐ¡heckedValue' => '0', ) );

Our current value is '0', as you can see in second param. And now it is impossible to make this checkbox ever checked, because it generates the following code in html: As you can see - the value always woul be '0' and there is no possibility to make it '1';

Now, last 2 rows of Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_CheckBox are the following: // and final element $html .= $this->\_createFormElement($id, $value, $params, $attribs);

And to fix this bug they should be changed to: // and final element $html .= $this->\_createFormElement($id, $checkboxInfo['checkedValue'], $params, $attribs);
