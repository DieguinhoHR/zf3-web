### Description

There is outdated docblock in Zend\_Controller-Overview docs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    367 +       /**
    368 +        * Set the dispatcher object.  The dispatcher is responsible for
    369 +        * taking a Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Token object, instantiating the controller, and
    370 +        * call the action method of the controller.
    371 +        *


Now there is no more token, I think it could be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    367 +       /**
    368 +        * Set the dispatcher object. The dispatcher is responsible for
    369 +        * pulling the controller and action from the request object, instantiating the controller, and
    370 +        * call the action method of the controller.
    371 +        *
