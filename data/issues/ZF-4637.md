ZF-4637: InArray autovalidation on Zend\_Form Select elements gives false positives

### Description

When adding a "select" element to Zend\_Form and not specifying select values (Zend uses numerical indices by default), and using the auto-enabled InArray validator, the validation erroneously validates when non-numeric values are submitted.

This is traced back to the functionality of php's in\_array with strict set by default to false.

For example:

 
        $form->addElement('select', 'myLabel', array(
            'multioptions' => array('myOption1', 'myOption2', 'myOption3'),
            'label'      => 'User Role:',
            'required'   => true,
        ));


If you inject an out of bounds number, it invalidates. However if you inject a string, it validates. This presents a security problem if you're relying on this validation to catch malformed posts.

Could you perhaps offer a full code example how to reproduce this problem instead of this snippet? That will greatly help in checking this issue.

Please provide a reproducable code snippet as requested 6 months ago. The above example is not reproducable.
