### Description

In the documentation for submitting a delete request through Gdata, the code example says to use the href attribute of a element in a feed entry. This is incorrect. The delete() method takes the id of the entry as its argument.

Please correct the code sample, and write a paragraph to describe explicitly which feed entry element to use for the argument of delete().

Wrote a small amount of new doc in Zend\_Gdata-Introduction.xml.
