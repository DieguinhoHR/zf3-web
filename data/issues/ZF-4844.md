### Description

fetchAll doesn't work properly with PDO::FETCH\_CLASS, because second parameter isn't passed to the PDO function. The same issue is with setFetchMode method which also doesn't pass all the necesary parameters to its parent (PDO) function.

Yes, I already noticed that. The problem is that fetch\*\*() methods are in the abstract class, and not in the pdo\_abstract one. Making your ideas possible would involve a huge refactoring of all the DB layer

Can you please link to the php.net man pages for the functionality you are missing? This above report is light on details and I would like to get a clearer picture as to what you are attempting to do.

[http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.setfetchmode.php) states that setFetchMode requires 2 or 3 arguments if FETCH\_CLASS is given as first. Therefore, anything that calls setFetchMode(FETCH\_CLASS) on PDO throws an exception.
