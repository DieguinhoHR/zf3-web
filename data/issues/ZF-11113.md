### Description

After connecting to an Oracle-DB PHP looses the connection because of an error on the DB-Server. The crash of oracle is not the problem, but the behaviour of our php-application: the Function Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle::\_prepare() failed with an PHP-Warning ('oci\_parse(): ORA-03114: not connected to ORACLE'). The coded exception was not thrown.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _prepare($sql)
        {
            $connection = $this->_adapter->getConnection();
            $this->_stmt = oci_parse($connection, $sql);
            if (!$this->_stmt) {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Db_Statement_Oracle_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Statement/Oracle/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Statement_Oracle_Exception(oci_error($connection));
            }
        }


I think the "oci\_parse($connection, $sql);" needed a leading "@", so the exception can be thrown. Functions like "\_bindParam" are realised with a "@".
