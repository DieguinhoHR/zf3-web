ZF-11780: Zend\_Form\_Element validation
----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-09-29T23:25:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-10-22T16:06:54.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When you set name of form element containing only digits (in string obviously) element is not validating

Exapmle:

Doesn't work: $question\_input = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File('6'); $question\_input->setDestination($dest\_path) ->addValidator('Extension', false, array('jpg,png,gif,jpeg')) ->addFilter(new Webility\_Filter\_LatinChars()) ->setRequired();

Works: $question\_input = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_File('q\_6'); $question\_input->setDestination($dest\_path) ->addValidator('Extension', false, array('jpg,png,gif,jpeg')) ->addFilter(new Webility\_Filter\_LatinChars()) ->setRequired();

As you can see in both cases file upload is required, but it work only when name containing some other chars than numbers. Probably you convert name of field to some variable name (as you know variables name cannot contain only digits) and lose some error info.

This is no failure by the file element but a default behaviour within Zend\_Form\_Element which all form elements are restricted to. Therefor reassigning to Zend\_Form's maintainer.
