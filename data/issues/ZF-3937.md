### Description

$temp[0] was used but it wasn't defined ( ! ) Notice: Undefined variable: temp in /Zend/Translate/Adapter.php on line 300

This occurs due to the change from empty() to isset() in [http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/code/browse/Standard_Library/trunk/library/Zend/Translate/Adapter.php?r1=10575&r2=10695)

The cause is that \_addTranslationData() adds the translation locale as an empty array() so isset evals to true.

From \_addTranslationData()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            $locale = (string) $locale;
            if (isset($this->_translate[$locale]) === false) {
                $this->_translate[$locale] = array();
            }

Your patch adds the problem that adding empty resource files is no longer possible. This is a huge problem when working with the search options. The problem will be solved differently.
