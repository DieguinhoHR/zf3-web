### Description

hi,

I dont know whether i'm supposed to use them in a different way now, but up to 9918 (i downgraded to 9918 and its working again) my decorators worked.

i have

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    
    class AlexL_Form_Decorator_TableRow extends Zend_Form_Decorator_Abstract
    {
        public function render($content)
        {
            Zend_Debug::dump($content);

string(77) " "

 
    <pre class="highlight">string(0) ""


and the output with 9919 is strange. i get my decorator with labels etc and AFTER that the input field. but it's supposed to be inside the decorator's output

Can you attach the full decorator, and an element that uses it?

In 9919, I did some refactoring to allow lazy-loading of decorators. While all tests continue to pass, there may have been edge cases that were never tested, and I'll need to see the full code necessary to reproduce the issue to verify.

Thanks!

ok, here a simplifies version. same bug applies:

 
    <pre class="highlight"><?php
    
    class AlexL_Form_Decorator_TableRow extends Zend_Form_Decorator_Abstract
    {
        public function render($content)
        {
            $e = $this->getElement();
            $r = "{$e->getLabel()}{$content}{$e->getDescription()}";
            
            // translation and error messages from zend_form omitted for simplicity
            
            return $r;
        }
    }

that is important since without it you wont see any error in rendering. problem is as described above that $content is always just an empty string

the element is a simple Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('test') with any label then i do: Zend\_Form\_Object->setElementDecorators(array('ViewHelper', new AlexL\_Form\_Decorator\_TableRow()));

I've run the following against current trunk:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class TestController extends Zend_Controller_Action
    {
        public function alexAction()
        {
            $form = new Zend_Form(array(
                'decorators' => array(
                    'FormElements',
                    array('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'table')),
                    'Form',
                ),
            ));
            $form->addElementPrefixPath('AlexL_Form_Decorator', 'AlexL/Form/Decorator', 'decorator');
            $form->addElement('text', 'test', array(
                'label' => 'Foo',
                'description' => 'this is the description',
                /*
                'decorators' => array(
                    'ViewHelper',
                    'Errors',
                    'TableRow',
                ),
                 */
            ));
            $form->setElementDecorators(array(
                'ViewHelper',
                'TableRow',
            ));
            $this->view->form = $form;
        }
    }


alternately commenting either the setElementDecorators() call or the element decorators; both work as expected.

What _doesn't_ work as expected is using a concrete instance of the decorator, which was the surprise for me. In that particular case, the input was placed _beneath_ the table row:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Foothis is the description

I'll look into it. For now, try using your custom class as a plugin, and don't instantiate it directly.

Scheduling for final release of 1.6.

I've added test cases in trunk that attempt to reproduce the issue -- but to no avail. Closing as I believe this issue no longer exists due to other changes that have been pushed to trunk.
