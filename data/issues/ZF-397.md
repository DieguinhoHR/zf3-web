ZF-397: Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_File exception thrown in \_\_destruct
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-09-25T07:41:14.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When using Zend::log with the simple text logging I ran a test to see what happened if the file is not writeable. I.e.

$data = 'some string'; Zend\_Log::registerLogger(new Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_File('/path/to/log.txt')); Zend\_Log::log($data);

This crashes PHP since the \_\_destruct function in Zend\_Log\_Adapter\_File calls $this->flush() which throws an exception if the file cannot be written to. During my learning of PHP5 I have seen that a \_\_destruct method cannot throw an exception. The error returned is:

Fatal error: Exception thrown without a stack frame in Unknown on line 0

I am not sure the best practise in this case, though I presume testing if the file can be written to should be done elsewhere than the destructor (i.e. as part of the Zend\_Log::registerLogger method).

Scheduling for release 0.8.0.

Assign to Bill Karwin for verification that these issues are resolved by the new Zend\_Log redesign.

No longer an issue since this class was replaced by Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream in release 0.9.2.
