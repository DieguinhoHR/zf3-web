### Description

It'll be nice to have opportunity to inject objects in common constructor.

Here's an example: [https://github.com/hoochie-coochie/â€¦](https://github.com/hoochie-coochie/Zend_DI-Examples/blob/experiments/inherited-injection/example-20.php) . Running this test yields Zend\\Di\\Exception\\MissingPropertyException.

Confirmed this works with setter injection but not constructor injection as of dd359a2c.
