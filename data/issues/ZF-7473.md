### Description

It seems that when Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource registers it self with Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader it doesn't add the "\_" at the end. So if you want to user two namespaces like My and MyXX the second one dosen't work.

If you add namespaces, I think you should just add 'My\_' and 'MyXX\_' as is shown here: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader.html#zend.loader.autoloader.usage)

The problem is with Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource that uses the loader, but dont use the "\_" at the end.

Dolf -- he's talking about Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource -- I've confirmed the issue.
