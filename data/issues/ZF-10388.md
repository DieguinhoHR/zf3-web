Please add an example with the problem you meant. Because inputs like "1.78" will never be seen as "Null". This is not the purpose of this filter.

Closing this issue as there was no further response from the reporter for reproduction.

Example: $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Null(); var\_dump($filter->filter(0.0));

expected to: null

returns: float 0

I think that Slava is correct. The documentation says ...

bq. Per default this filter works like PHP's empty() method; in other words, if empty() returns a boolean TRUE, then a NULL value will be returned.

and ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $var = 0.0;
    var_dump(empty($var)); // bool(true)

Change from Bug to Improvement. Float is not described by php's manual. This is sort of a hidden or undescribed feature.

Thomas - actually it is, [<http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.empty.php>]

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    The following things are considered to be empty:
    
        "" (an empty string)
        0 (0 as an integer)
        0.0 (0 as a float)
        "0" (0 as a string)
        NULL
        FALSE
        array() (an empty array)
        var $var; (a variable declared, but without a value in a class)

I have a downloaded manual from beginning this year (newer version than mentioned in this issue) and there it is not mentioned. This must have been added into php's manual somewhere after this issue has been written.
