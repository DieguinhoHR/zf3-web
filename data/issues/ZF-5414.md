### Description

Non ASCII characters break the columns when input is UTF-8 encoded.

The problem is located in the Zend\_Text\_Table\_Column class on line 229. The str\_pad() function is used and it is not overloaded by mbstring extension so it fails calculating correctly the string length.

Iconv has to be used instead of mbstring because it's available in default php installations. Mbstring is only allowed to be used when there is no other way.

Jean, can you please submit a test case to demonstrate, how the column breaks?
