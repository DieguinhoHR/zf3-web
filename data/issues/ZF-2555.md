### Description

If you want to make the following sql request with Zend\_Db\_Select :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM table1 a
    RIGHT JOIN table2 b on (b.id = a.id)
    WHERE (a.xxx = 'yy')
    
    $select->from(array('a'=>'table1', 'count(*) as nbre', $this->_schema);
    $select->joinRight(array('b'=>'table2'), 'b.id = a.id', false);


This exemple, I do not want the fields of table2, I write "false" in joinRight()

The result SQL is :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT COUNT(*), b.
    FROM table1 a
    RIGHT JOIN table2 b on (b.id = a.id)
    WHERE (a.xxx = 'yy')


And not work.

For fix this, modify this :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _tableCols($correlationName, $cols) {
            if (!$cols) return;  /*<== added */
    ....


in Zend/db/select.php

Regards

Pass an empty array() instead of false, and it works just fine.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
