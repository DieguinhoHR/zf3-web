The PHP manual page for iconv agrees.

Fixed in trunk r24166 Merged to release-1.11 in r24167

I retract my prior statement. On AIX, ISO8859-1 is the proper charset definition. I, of course, jumped the gun in assuming (logically) that you were correct, but this page says otherwise: <http://php.net/manual/en/iconv.configuration.php>

Backed out from release-1.11 in r24158 Backed out from trunk in r24159

ah, so it is, sorry about that. I didn't dig too deeply into it and just assumed that the name of a char set would be consistent

No worries. I did exactly the same thing.
