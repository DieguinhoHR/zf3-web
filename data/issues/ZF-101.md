### Description

<http://framework.zend.com/developer/ticket/99>

Zend\_View\_Abstract::\_loadClass() calls is\_readable() to find out if the particular file exists on the path.

This causes problems when you want to have a set of common view helpers for multiple projects. In my case, I use a directory called Akrabat/View/Helper as part of a tree that mirrors the ZF tree for consistency.)

My preference would be to change

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if (is_readable($dir . $file)) {


to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        if (Zend::isReadable($dir . $file)) {


to solve this problem.

Suggested patch attached.

Rather than make the class dependant on Zend.php how about changing...

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    if (is_readable($dir . $file)) {
        include $dir . $file;


...to...

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    if (include $dir . $file) {


...which would achieve much the same result

Forget my suggestion...

 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    if (include $dir . $file) {


...as this produces warnings as each \_path stack is looped over

Mind looking at this for 0.2.0?

One way is explode the path and then loop through it doing a Zend::isReadable() for each path with the requested file, that is somewhat slow in my eyes, but it's the only solution I see for making this work.

Fixed in 1428

Further analysis shows that the original behaviour was intentional. addScriptPath() can be used at any point to add additional view script paths to the view object. The reporter need only have done the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->addScriptPath('/path/to/common/view/scripts');

Behaviour was intentional, and a way to do as the reporter desired already existed in the code.
