### Description

Zend\_Rest\_Route needs to be translatable just like Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route, maybe the translation part can be moved to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract in order to support routing translations to most routers. Translation is needed for search engine optimization.
