### Description

Zend\_Debug::dump() bug:

if data in variable not in utf-8, its striped by htmlentities

bug:

Debug.php @ 93 line

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    htmlentities($output, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')


fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    htmlspecialchars($output, ENT_QUOTES)


Why? 1) Data can be not only utf-8 encoding 2) if you are using ENT\_QUOTES, you dont need htmlentities ;-)
