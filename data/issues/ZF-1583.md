### Description

h4. Problem In the Apc.php file, Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_APC should be Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Apc as it seems to break the naming convention.

Hi Marty, can you clarify as to why this issue has been scheduled for 1.1.0? As far as I can see renaming the class to fit naming conventions will not affect the stability of the 1.0 api because class names are case in-sensitive. Perhaps you could enlighten me on this. :)

Because, file names are not case insensitive (on linux/unix :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // [...]       
            // For perfs reasons, we do not use the Zend_Loader::loadClass() method
            // (security controls are explicit)
            require_once str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $frontendClass) . '.php';
            require_once str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $backendClass) . '.php';
    // [...]


So I prefer do not change anything before 1.0

Thanks for the quick reply :), but either you or some one else implemented normalization of the input so that problem would not apply to this situation.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [...]
            // because lowercase will fail
            $frontend = self::_normalizeName($frontend);
            $backend  = self::_normalizeName($backend);
    [...]
            // For perfs reasons, we do not use the Zend_Loader::loadClass() method
            // (security controls are explicit)
            require_once str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $frontendClass) . '.php';
            require_once str_replace('_', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $backendClass) . '.php';
    [...]

This small issue would be better fixed now than later, in my opinion, since the effect will only be worse after 1.0.0 GA and uptake dramatically increases. Sure, we wanted to be stable before now, but we must be stable after 1.0.0 GA. Are there really compelling reasons to delay this simple fix?
