### Description

The following notice is often found in my website logs. If this is not a bug, could the notice be supressed or sufficient checks put in place so that it is not raised.

It means, that input string is not in current locale. In this case iconv can't converts all symbols correctly .

You should change current locale or convert string to ascii beforeadding it to the document. Like it described here - [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.charset.html): $docText = iconv('ISO-8859-1', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT', $docText);

Is covered by new encoding processing functionality.

Details are described in documentation and [FW-General](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFMLGEN/mail/18963).
