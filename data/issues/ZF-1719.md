### Description

Zend/Measure/Temperature.php, lines 50-51 currently:

'CELSIUS' => array(array('' => 1, '+' => 274.15),'°C'), 'FAHRENHEIT' => array(array('' => 1, '-' => 32, '/' => 1.8, '+' => 273.15),'°F'),

Should be:

 
       'CELSIUS'    => array(array('' => 1, '+' => 273.15),'Â°C'),
       'FAHRENHEIT' => array(array('' => 1, '+' => 459.67, '/' => 9, '*' => 5 ),'Â°F'),

The lines you gave are not from the actual trunk. Before creating a problem please do always check against the last SVN version.

I created the following example:

<

pre class="highlight">    <?php
    require_once 'Zend/Measure/Temperature.php';

print "

 
    ";
    print "1 FAHRENHEIT = ";
    $temp = new Zend_Measure_Temperature(1,Zend_Measure_Temperature::FAHRENHEIT);
    $temp->setType(Zend_Measure_Temperature::KELVIN);
    print $temp . " KELVIN\n";
    
    print "1 CELSIUS = ";
    $temp = new Zend_Measure_Temperature(1,Zend_Measure_Temperature::CELSIUS);
    $temp->setType(Zend_Measure_Temperature::KELVIN);
    print $temp . " KELVIN\n";


which creates the following output using SVN 5693:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    1 FAHRENHEIT = 255.927777778 °K KELVIN
    1 CELSIUS = 274.15 °K KELVIN


and using the input on "onlineconversions.com" like you mentioned gives me the following output:

1 degree Fahrenheit = 255.9277778 kelvin 1 degree Celsius = 274.15 kelvin

Sorry but I see absolotely NO ISSUE on values which are calculated correct.

Mentioned problems can not be verified with the given data. Created testcode gives exact results.

I'm sorry about that. I said it was wrong in 1.0. Apparently it got fixed in the trunk. I first posted in the mailing list and nobody acknowledged the problem. And I searched the issue tracker here.

Thanks for the quick response. Sorry for wasting your time. This is my first time posting an issue. I will check trunk also before posting one next time.

Again, my apologies.

No problem...

I expect this is one of the reasons why we evolve the framework.... to get bugs fixed and new features included ;-)
