ZF-4834: Spaces and Special Characters Are Not Escaped in Passwords for Zend Db Connections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-11-06T09:52:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-09-18T19:16:37.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

It appears Zend Db just passes the password along in a DSN string without escaping characters as one may expect with such an abstraction. Escaping special characters with a backslash is a work-around.

Can you provide a use case demonstrating the issue?

Thanks, Ralph

Using a password like 'pw with spaces' when connecting to a Postgresql back-end will produce an error while using 'pw\\ with\\ spaces' works.

Justin Verweel has reported a similar issue on the mailing list. His problem was with usernames:

Hello all,

I'm using Zend\_Db to connect to a postgresql database server, works fine until today when I added a new login role with a whitespace in it's rolename. When I try to connect to the database with that rolename, an exception tells me there is something wrong with the rolename.

I tried to connect to the database with that rolename in PgAdmin III and that works fine, so postgresql accepts a rolename with a whitespace.

Some code I used to test:

// With my own rolename it works fine $aParams = array( 'host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'justin', 'password' => '\*\*\*\*',  
 'dbname' => 'test' ); $oDb = Zend\_Db::factory( 'pdo\_pgsql', $aParams ); $oDb->prepare( 'SELECT 1' )->execute();

// But this fails $aParams = array( 'host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'jan willem', 'password' => '\*\*\*\*',  
 'dbname' => 'test' ); $oDb = Zend\_Db::factory( 'pdo\_pgsql', $aParams ); $oDb->prepare( 'SELECT 1' )->execute();

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Exception' with message 'SQLSTATE[08006] [7] missing "=" after "willem" in connection info string' in /usr/local/ZendFramework/1.7.0/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php:143 Stack trace: #0 /usr/local/ZendFramework/1.7.0/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php(167): Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract->\_connect() #1 /home/justin/domains/dev.intern.basisscholenonline.nl/public\_html/postgres.php(19): Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract->prepare('SELECT 1') #2 {main} thrown in /usr/local/ZendFramework/1.7.0/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php on line 143

I figured out that escaping the whitespace fixes this problem, but shouldn't this been done by Zend\_Db instead of myself?

Thnx and greetings.

Justin Verweel

p.s. Used ZF version is 1.7.1

is this postgres specific? are they any other special rules?

With pdo\_mysql and ZF 1.11.0dev it works without problems.
