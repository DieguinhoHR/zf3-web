ZF-7716: Zend\_Json\_Server doesn't respect additional args
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Json\_Server, line 143:

public function setClass($class, $namespace = '', $argv = null) { $argv = null;

after removing the $argv = null, server accepts additional args very well. So why is it ignored?
