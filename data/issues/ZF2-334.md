### Description

In order to use the document list API, we need to use SSH url.

But in library\\Zend\\GData\\Docs.php at line 38, the url is '[http://docs.google.com/feeds/documents/…](http://docs.google.com/feeds/documents/private/full)' instead of [https://docs.google.com/feeds/documents/…](https://docs.google.com/feeds/documents/private/full)

We could give a specific url to documentListFeed function but as to a functional address in the constants, no ?

I have try with personnal and pro account it works with https and not with http.

I guess that when you are talking about SSH url you really want to say HTTP secure url.

Excuse me, I wanted talking about SSL (and of course no SSH). So yes I speak of HTTP secure url.
