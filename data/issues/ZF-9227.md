ZF-9227: Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::setRedirect does not set Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract::\_isRedirect

### Description

Calling setRedirect on a Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract-based Class (like Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Http) does not set the \_isRedirect-Flag.

There would be at least 2 Ways to fix this.

1) setting \_isRedirect in the setRedirect-Method 2) setting \_isRedirect in setHeader if the header-name matches 'Location', like it is done in setRawHeader() already.

Will attach Patch + Unittest for version 1) and 2) soon.

If version 2) does not break anything for compatibility-reasons in setHeader() it would be my prefered way because it adds the functionality which already exists in setRawHeader(), which would be more consistent.

Closed after talking with Matthew Weier O'Phinney in #zftalk.dev . Behaviour should be like it is, because there can be cases (JSON-REST) where a Location-Header does not mean a redirect.
