### Description

In file ItemEntry.php, line 89 the undefined constant 'this' was returned instead of the internal object identifier '$this'. I marked this as a major bug because, although I've not tested the results, I expect PHP will attempt to translate the undefined constant to a string.

This issue of Zend/Gdata/Gbase/ItemEntry.php, seems to be fixed SVN r9622, I think.
