### Description

current php 5.3 snapshot throws the following fatal errors:

[09-Jun-2008 14:26:08] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_get() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 247 [09-Jun-2008 14:27:14] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_set() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 269 [09-Jun-2008 14:27:39] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_isset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 354 [09-Jun-2008 14:28:07] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_isset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 354 [09-Jun-2008 14:28:33] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_unset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Session/Namespace.php on line 374 [09-Jun-2008 14:28:50] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_isset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Config.php on line 181 [09-Jun-2008 14:29:33] PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_unset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Config.php on line 193

an other one is located in:

PHP Fatal error: The magic method \_\_call() must have public visibility and can not be static in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Db/Select.php on line 1162

its a general issue

Re-assigning to Matthew as he is more familiar with the PHP 5.3-related issues.

I'm wondering why did the PHPGroup take such a decision ?
