### Description

the class Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor has ordinary plugins operations but doesn't allow us to use similar methods for extra ones.

extra plugins are part of dijit.editor component as can be seen here: [http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/â€¦](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dijit/Editor.html#plugins)

suggested additions to class Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Editor and suggested test units for being add to class Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_EditorTest can be found attached.

the fix for this depends on ZF-5711

Patches applied to trunk. As this provides new features, I have not merged into the 1.11 release branch. If we do a 1.12 release branch, the features will be incorporated; I will also clone the issue to the ZF2 project so that the support will be pushed upstream.
