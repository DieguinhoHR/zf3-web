### Description

Since it's a functionality of PHP SoapClient, Zend\_Soap\_Client should accept 'user\_agent' option. Becareful that empty string for this option says to SoapClient to not send 'user\_agent' header at all, thus Zend\_Soap\_Client::[get|set]Options() should accept empty string for this option.

fixed in trunk (r19024).

The 'user\_agent'-option now accepts empty strings and passes them on to the underlying SoapClient.
