Stomp 1.1 is designed to be backwards compatible with 1.0 clients, could you be clear about whether this is actually a feature request (to take advantage of 1.1 features) or if there is an actual bug with connecting to a 1.1 server with Zend\_Queue?

It is actual bug with connecting to 1.1 Servers (RabbitMQ and HornetQ). The realization 1.1 will fix it. It is also possible to fix ZF-11697 and ZF-9958 to improve such situation.
