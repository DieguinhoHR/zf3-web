### Description

In Zend\_Config\_Xml the \_\_constructor's doc says:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
       /**
         * Loads the section $section from the config file (or string $xml for
         * access facilitated by nested object properties.
         *
         * Sections are defined in the XML as children of the root element.
         *
         * In order to extend another section, a section defines the "extends"
         * attribute having a value of the section name from which the extending
         * section inherits values.
         *
         * Note that the keys in $section will override any keys of the same
         * name in the sections that have been included via "extends".
         *
         * @param  string  $filename           File to process
         * @param  mixed   $section            Section to process
         * @param  boolean $allowModifications Wether modifiacations are allowed at runtime
         * @throws Zend_Config_Exception When filename is not set
         * @throws Zend_Config_Exception When section $sectionName cannot be found in $filename
         */


But the function declaration is: public function \_\_construct($filename, $section = null, $options = false)
