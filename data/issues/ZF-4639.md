Duplication of already fixed issue

How is this fixed? I just downloaded 1.6.2, and it's still there....

 

 

Posted by Taylor Ettema (tettema) on 2008-10-19T21:50:02.000+0000

Just to be precise - the warning is thrown out of getFilters when I came across it in 1.6.2

As mentioned already fixed with r11906

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place, but... Looking at both r11906 and the 1.6.2 release, I see the fix in the getValidators function, but not in the getFilters function...

Then please give php version and reproducable code... unittests are not showing problems, and also when calling getFilters I see no failure message at all.

Thomas, here is a snippet of code that throws the error. Hope this helps.

PHP 5.2.0 ZF 1.6.2

Running the attached script throws the following in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract on my machine:

PHP Notice: Undefined variable: result in /Users/michel/web-lib/ZendFramework-1.6.2-minimal/library/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php on line 803 PHP Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /Users/michel/web-lib/ZendFramework-1.6.2-minimal/library/Zend/Form/Element.php on line 524

I also still see an issue with a Zend Form with a File element, as soon as I call form->getData (or whatever it is), it throws that warning.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-10-21T10:05:36.000+0000

Sorry, but Zend\_Form is not Zend\_File\_Translate... These are 2 different components from different authors.

When you having problems with getData please open a issue with Zend\_Form as component and not Zend\_File\_Transfer.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2008-10-21T10:12:09.000+0000

In your attached example, based on the call of clearFilters I found a possible problem.

It's fixed with r12055.

Still to mention:

- Please use the correct component... when a failure is thrown by usage of Zend\_Form then attach this component and not another
- Please add ALWAYS your used php and ZF version
- Please add reproducabel code... without it it's nearly impossible to help when file uploads are done

{quote} Please use the correct component... when a failure is thrown by usage of Zend\_Form then attach this component and not another {quote}

My apologies. I thought it had to be the component that throws the error. I'll keep this, and your other remarks, in mind for the future.
