### Description

Hello,

I Have a CMS developed with Zend Framework 1.11.7 installed one in a server Linux CentOS, and up to last week everything was working well, but now ningun form of the CMS allows to do INSERT/UPDATE when sending in any field varchar a chain with more of 90 characters, gives me this mistake:

1. In Chrome: Error 324 (net::ERR\_EMPTY\_RESPONSE): The server has closed the connection without sending any information.
2. In Firefox: This page appears broken. DNS Error - Server cannot be found

When sending less than 90 characters the formulario work well, I have detected that alone this spends with the sentences INSERT/UPDATE, with the SELECT there is no problem, I try to execute the same query with mas of 90 characters from a page php that it does not use zend and I record without problem in MySQL.

In Internet this mistake this one associated with problems of cookies but in this case this it is not the mistake, I believe that this problem being generated algun in zend but I do not manage to capture the mistake to sorrow that I it have formed like "development".

Please someone who could help with this problem.

Regards, Martin
