### Description

Zend\_Session class does not store the custom save-handler inside the class so we can access it at a later time to configure it further.

Zend\_Session::getSaveHandler()->setXxxx()

Thoughts...?

This got double-posted due to ZIRA going Yo-Yo! Please remove this issue, too - along with 2038.

I support the idea of storing the save handler object as a static member and providing access to it via Zend\_Session::getSaveHandler(). Maybe the method returns null if no custom save handler has been set.

Shekar,

I have added the requested method. I have run the unit tests and everything looks sane. Unfortunatly, Zend\_Session does not have a test for save handler, so I think if you could test this method just to make sure its doing what you want (After all it is simply an accessor), that will have to suffice for a test until after 1.5 when I have the time to dedicated some energies to Zend\_Sessions tests.

Lemme know if it all works out :)

Ralph,

I've tested the new method and it works like a charm!

Thanks!
