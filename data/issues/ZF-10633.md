### Description

Hi there

I'm trying to add some personal route but i have a bug.

So, i initialize my routes like this :

- - - - - -

$frontController = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $router = $frontController->getRouter(); $router->removeDefaultRoutes();

$router->addRoute( "langmodulecontrolleraction", new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route( "/:lang/:module/:controller/:action/\*", array ( "lang" => "en", "module" => "default", "controller" => "index", "action" => "index" ) ) );

- - - - - -

in my index action of index controller of default module, after create a logs dir in application dir :

- - - - - -

$date = new Zend\_Date(); $name = $date->toString("yyyyMMddTHH"); $file = fopen(APPLICATION\_PATH . "/logs/" . $name, "a+"); fwrite($file, "here" . "\\n");

- - - - - -

so when i call only once "http://my.localhost/", i have two lines in the log file :

- - - - - -

here here

- - - - - -

The problem do not appear in firefox where one call write on line

So what can i do to fix this ? is another way to define my route please ?

Thanks

Most likely, the issue is browser-specific, and could be one of the following: \* Your rewrite rule may be having ZF answer for unfound images, such as favicon.ico. One way to fix this is to alter your rewrite rule to only answer for non-image, non-js, non-css files. Examples are in the manual for this. \* You may have a developer extension in place that is making a second request in order to get timing/profiling information.

I'm resolving this issue as "won't fix". Please ask on the mailing list if you continue to have issues.
