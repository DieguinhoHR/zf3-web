### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.date.constants.html)

The tables of constants on the documentation page are somewhat illegible due to the lack of cell padding, borders and width consistency.

Moving issue from Zend\_Date to unknown.

The manual itself is correct. The problem seems to be the CSS which is done on the homepage which is not part of the manual itself.
