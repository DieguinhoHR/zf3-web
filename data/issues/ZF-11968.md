### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract offers the ability to execute some specific logic before and after a Row creation, update and deletion via the following methods: \* \_preInsert() \* \_postInsert() \* \_preUpdate() \* \_postUpdate() \* \_preDelete() \* \_postDelete()

There is no such thing in Zend\_Ldap\_Node or Zend\_Ldap\_Node\_Abstract. When one have subclassed Zend\_Ldap\_Node he could want to perform special actions when a LDAP entry/node gets updated (_eg._ recompute displayName from givenName and surname, password changed notification, etc.).

As Zend\_Ldap\_Node::update() performs all useful checks before calling the relevant Zend\_Ldap methods (add(), (update() or (delete()) it would be fairly easy to add this feature.

+Patch file proposal:+ Here is a patch (based on Zend\\Ldap\\Node.php r24352) that adds pre/post add/update/rename/delete methods.

Minor typos

Fixed in ZF1 trunk and in 1.11 release branch. Patch implemented as provided by the OP

Also fixed in ZF2 - pull request <https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/745>

Thanks

Stefan -- please back this out of the 1.11 release branch. New features should not be added within a bugfix release, only with new minor/major releases. We can release this with 1.12.0.

Stefan -- also, for ZF2, this functionality should be implemented using an EventManager instance instead. If you want some ideas on how that might be accomplished, ping me.

Re-opening, as the functionality needs to be backed out of the 1.11 release branch, and targetted for the 1.12.0 release.

 

 

Posted by Stefan Gehrig (sgehrig) on 2012-01-23T15:51:36.000+0000

removed fix from the 1.11 branch

Thanks, Stefan. If you need any assistance with the ZF2 version of the patch, let me know.
