### Description

I have run into an issue with using PNG24 images with Zend\_Pdf. If I draw a PNG24 image onto a page, colors used to draw shapes are text end up discolored. In my tests, the colors are darker than they should be.

As an example, text that should have been colored (0,0,255) end up as (56,83,164), according to Photoshop.

It does not matter which order the drawing occurs. If I draw the text first, and then draw the image, it is the same as if I had done the reverse.

Using other types of images have not created the same issue. Even PNG8 images work correctly. I have tried using my own PNG24 images and some found online with the same results.

Here is some sample code to recreate the issue. Simply commenting out the drawImage call fixes the discoloration issue.

 
        // Create the pdf document
        $pdf = new Zend_Pdf();
    
        // Create a page
        $page = new Zend_Pdf_Page(Zend_Pdf_Page::SIZE_LETTER);
    
        // Add the page to the pdf document
        $pdf->pages[] = $page;
    
        // Load the image
        $image = Zend_Pdf_Image::imageWithPath('/path/to/some/png24');
    
        // Draw the image
        $page->drawImage($image, 100, 125, 100 + $image->getPixelWidth(), 125 + $image->getPixelHeight());
    
        // Create the color blue
        $color = new Zend_Pdf_Color_Rgb(0, 0, 1);
    
        // Assign the color
        $page->setFillColor($color);
    
        // Set the font to helvetica
        $page->setFont(Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName(Zend_Pdf_Font::FONT_HELVETICA), 10);
    
        // Draw some text
        $page->drawText('Some test text in blue color.', 100, 100);
    
        header('Content-type: application/pdf');
        echo $pdf->render();
        die();
