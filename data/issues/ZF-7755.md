ZF-7755: Zend\_Form does not unescape data from post

### Description

We have been using Zend\_Form for some time now and I have recently been having an issue with a particular application where if the validation of the form failed any escaped character would get escaped an additional time. Eventually ending up with strings in the post such as:

product "name" -> product \\\\"name\\\\"

The problem is that when you get the post array it is escaped and when you put it in to zend\_form to validate:

$form->isValid($this->getRequest()->getPost())

It will continually escape and re-escape the variables. Quotes in input are generally infrequent but we have just started implementing a product description input which of course has strings such as:

<

p class="bold">

which are heavily effected. There are of course workarounds to the problem such as recursively striping slashes from the post array before giving it to the zend\_form, but for ease I would expect that you would be able to pass the post array straight to the form.

This is not a problem of Zend\_Form, rather that you are using magic quotes, which it is commonly agreed, should _not_ be relied upon.

You should turn of magic quotes.

Closing as this duplicates a previously closed issue, which was closed as "wont fix"

Thanks for the swift response, turning off magic quotes fixed the issue. We have magic quotes off, but this was a virtual box that had recently been set up for development and this configuration was missed.
