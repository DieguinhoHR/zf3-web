### Description

There is a bug in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract in a vicious case, using pdo\_mysql adapter. When you create a properly redefined Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract object , it searches for the database column names to use them. To make this, it uses :

(Zend/Db/Table/Abstract.php on line 352)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $desc = $this->_db->describeTable($this->_name);


==> $this->\_name represent the TABLE name, but Database name should be passed as second parameter to describeTable(). <== ( but there doesn't seem to be a way to make this done as the DB name is not accessible from any property of any object)

==> If the PDO\_Mysql driver is used to perform describeTable(), the database name is not passed to it :

(Zend/Db/Table/Adapter/Pdo/Mysql.php line 96)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function describeTable($tableName, $schemaName = null)
        {
    // if the information_schema table available ( Mysql >=5 ) , then it is used in the process :  
    return $this->_describeTableInformationSchema($tableName, $schemaName);


$schemaName is null ( not given previously).

So, if the information\_schema is used to look into the tables, then the abstract adapter calls \_describeTableInformationSchema() without telling it the database name, and then generating an object cascading bug that makes Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract unable to fetch columns names properly

Zend/Db/Table/Adapter/Abstract.php line 594

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // schemaName is null, not (cascading) given
    protected function _describeTableInformationSchema($tableName, $schemaName = null)
        {
            $sql = "SELECT c.table_schema, c.table_name, c.column_name,
                  c.ordinal_position as column_ordinal_position, (... getting $tableName information )
              
            if ($schemaName != null) {
                $sql .= " AND c.table_schema = '$schemaName'"; // and NOT giving the Database name ( $schemaName still cascading null )
            }


That way, IF AND ONLY IF you have SEVERAL databases, with SAME COLUMN NAMES ( my case ), then the \_describeTableInformationSchema doesn't return the right result, mixing tables columns from differents databases ( that could lead to security issues, in some cases ).

Note that the mysql user logged in must have acces to those databases for them to be described in INFORMATION\_SCHEMA database. But it IS a possible use case, usually on developpement servers.

Noticed on 0.9

Resolved in revision 4202. We no longer use INFORMATION\_SCHEMA at all.
