ZF-5790: A db WHERE with a ? and a ' in it, raise an exception

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-02-15T07:59:33.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-08-20T14:35:23.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

This is the minimal test case:

 
    $model = new Project();
    $q = "test?'";
    $rs = $model->fetchAll($model->select()->where('name=?',$q));


Raises "SQLSTATE[HY093]: Invalid parameter number: no parameters were bound"

Note that $q contains a ? AND a ' (single quote)

With a single "?" or a single "'" it works as expected.

Using PDO\_MYSQL adapter PHP 5.2.6 (Ubuntu)

php\_value magic\_quotes\_gpc "0" php\_value magic\_quotes\_runtime "0" php\_value magic\_quotes\_sybase "0"

UPDATE: with the MYSQLI adapter it works.

The Project model is simply something like that

Class Project extends Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract {

}
