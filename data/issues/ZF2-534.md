### Description

The Zend\\Log\\Writer\\Syslog constructors accepts an option array for which the key "application" is meant to contain the application name. Unfortunately, this value is put in an instance variable called "application" (which is undeclared) rather than in "appName". This means that the application name is always "'Zend\\Log'" in the syslog.
