ZF-12123: Float with comma not correctly quoted by Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract::\_quote()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Some locales convert floats to string with a comma instead of a dot, as fr\_FR. (string)12.34 == "12,34".

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_quote() handle this by using sprintf('%F', $value) when is\_float($value) line 843. Float is converted to string with a dot regardless of the locale used.

But Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Abstract::\_quote() does not, line 292. This leads to a bug. For instance, with $db instanceof Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql :

echo (string) $db->select()->from('foo')->where('bar = ?', 12.34); //"SELECT `foo`.\* FROM `foo` WHERE (bar = 12,34)"

Mysql error : "#1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax;..."

I think ...\_Pdo\_Abstract::\_quote() should do the same as ...\_Abstact::\_quote() ?
