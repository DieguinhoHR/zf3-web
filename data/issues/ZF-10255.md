### Description

I believe this problem was introduced by ZF-10035

The following test makes the problem pretty apparent:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    if (count($argv) !== 2)
    {
                    die('Zend version required' . PHP_EOL);
    }
    
    $zendVersion = $argv[1];
    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . 'ZendFramework-' . $zendVersion . '-minimal/library/');
    require_once('Zend/Service/Amazon/S3.php');
    
    $filePath = '';
    $accessKey = '';
    $secretKey = '';
    
    $s3 = new Zend_Service_Amazon_S3($accessKey, $secretKey);
    $s3->registerStreamWrapper('s3');
    
    if ($s3->isObjectAvailable($filePath))
    {
            $handle = fopen('s3://' . $filePath, 'r');
            $startTime = time();
    
            while (!feof($handle))
            {
                            fread($handle, 8192);
            }
    
            echo 'Took ' . (time() - $startTime) . 's to stream file' . PHP_EOL;
    }
    else
    {
            die('File is not available' . PHP_EOL);
    }
    
    ?>


For a 10mb file, we have the following:

$ php s3.php "1.10.6" Took 3s to stream file $ php s3.php "1.10.7" Took 210s to stream file

--

It seems like _every_ request for a 8192 chunk opens a new HTTP connection to Amazon (for a 10mb file, thats 1280 separate HTTP connections).
