ZF-8813: AMF responses with multiple bodies comprising objects time out

### Description

If a response has multiple bodies (in response to a request containing multiple bodies), and one or more of the bodies consists of an Object (as opposed to primitive) the response will time out.

The request is properly processed (and the relevant methods on the services have been invoked), it seems to be an issue with serializing the response.

I haven't done any packet sniffing yet, but have verified this with a fresh install of Zend AMF 1.9.7.

My AS3 / MXML example code is:

 
    <mx:ChannelSet id="channelSet">
    </mx:ChannelSet>
    
    <mx:RemoteObject id="test" destination="Test" source="Test" showBusyCursor="true" channelSet="{ channelSet }" />
    <mx:RemoteObject id="test2" destination="Test2" source="Test2" showBusyCursor="true" channelSet="{ channelSet }" />


private function init() : void { var amfChannel : AMFChannel = new AMFChannel( null, "http://localhost/amf\_test/" );

 
                channelSet.addChannel( amfChannel );
    
                var bla : TestClass = new TestClass();
    
                var call    : AsyncToken    = test.testMethod( bla );
                var call2   : AsyncToken    = test2.testMethod( "Test2" );
    
                call.addResponder( this );
                call2.addResponder( this );
            }


On the server-side there is a mapped PHP version of TestClass and Test and Test2 simply echo whatever is sent to them.
