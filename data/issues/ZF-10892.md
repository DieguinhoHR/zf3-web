### Description

In my project I detect the following bug.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateString = '01/02/2011';
    $date = new Zend_Date($dateString, 'MM/dd/YYYY');
    $resultString = $date->toString('YYYY-MM-dd');


As a result the variable $resultString contains '2010-01-02'. If try to proceed inverse operation with this non correct date.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $dateString = '2010-01-02';
    $date = new Zend_Date($dateString, 'YYYY-MM-dd');
    $resultString = $date->toString('MM/dd/YYYY');


We get new value - '01/02/2009'.

This bug is reproduced only with 2 dates: (format 'MM-dd-YYYY') 01-01-2011 01-02-2011

Another dates are converted in correct way.

Not an issue of according to the manual and the FAQ "YYYY" is the Calendar (ISO) Year and "yyyy" the real year.
