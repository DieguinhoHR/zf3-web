### Description

There is a notice in function Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Pgsql::describeTable when the script tries to determine the length of character varying data type. In

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            while ($row = $result->fetch()) {
                if ($row<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/interactive/datatype-character.html">'type'] == 'varchar') {
                    preg_match('/character varying\((\d+)\)/', $row['complete_type'], $matches);
                    $row['length'] = $matches[1];
                }
    </a>

is supposed that character varying data type has always preset its length (in preg\_match function).

As stated in [PostgreSQL online manual it is not a requirement: ??The notations varchar(n) and char(n) are aliases for character varying(n) and character(n), respectively. character without length specifier is equivalent to character(1); if character varying is used without length specifier, the type accepts strings of any size. The latter is a PostgreSQL extension.??

I slightly modify the code

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            while ($row = $result->fetch()) {
                if ($row['type'] == 'varchar') {
                    if (preg_match('/character varying\((\d+)\)/', $row['complete_type'], $matches)) {
                        $row['length'] = $matches[1];
                    }
                }


and now it works for me, but I don't know, if this change doesn't break code elsewhere.

This can be found in svn trunk (r. 3196 at now)
