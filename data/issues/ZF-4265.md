### Description

The image quality of Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha('image' ... really needs improvement. We should be able at least to choose a %tage of image deformation, an image background, or no image deformation at all. The black and white backgound image makes it often difficult to read.

Yep also an option to define some colors would be nice.

I will look into making it more configurable - but also it would be really easy to use your own image generator (including amending the existing one) if you wanted to - just extend the Zend\_Captcha\_Image class and override \_generateImage.

As for colors I'm not sure it's a good idea - having different colors rarely adds much since it is very easy for a robot to convert it back to b&w, but it often makes it easier to read characters - e.g. if noise and symbols have different colors, the robot could just filter the "noisy" color out automatically.

However, if you have an idea for using colors that you think would add strength - please share.

Hehe yeah you could but most of us dont have the time to create an own image generator and to think up some sin/cos mathematical stuff :) So thanks for looking into it.

The color option was just an idea, there a cases where you want the captcha make more readable and a colored font adds to that option. But you could create a gradient or color spots to the background to make it harder for robots.

added setDotNoise() and setLineNoise() so that noise level can be configured. Also added setStartImage() so that image could be initialized with some non-empty image (should be PNG)
