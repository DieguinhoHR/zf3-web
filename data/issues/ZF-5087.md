### Description

As a developer I want log functionality to: - be terse, and compact, but still readable - provide me the information I need, when inspecting it.

The latter requirement asks for formatted messages including values of variables. The former requirement tells me that a syntax like

$log->log(sprintf($format, ...), $level)

could be expressed better like:

$log->log($level, $format, ...)

I implemented this in a class derived from Zend\_Log. I think it would be nce to add this to the framework class itself. Note that for reasons of backward compatibility I changed the (in my opinion preferred) order of the arguments to:

$log->log($format, $level, ...)

Though, by inspecting type it is probably possible to support both. But for the shortcut methods this isn't a problem anyway. This is the code from my derived class

 
    /**
     * Log a message at a priority with formatting parameters
     *
     * @param  string   $message   Format of message to log (printf style)
     * @param  integer  $priority  Priority of message
     * @param  mixed    $... values to inject into the message
     * @return void
     * @throws Zend_Log_Exception
     */
    public function log($message, $priority)
    {
        $numargs = func_num_args();
        if ($numargs > 2)
        {
            $arg_list = func_get_args();
            array_shift($arg_list);
            array_shift($arg_list);
            if (count($arg_list) == 1 && is_array($arg_list[0]))
            {
                // probably invoked via __call
                $arg_list = $arg_list[0];
            }
            $message = vsprintf($message, $arg_list);
        }
        parent::log($message, $priority);
    }
    
    /**
     * Undefined method handler allows a shortcut:
     *   $log->priorityName('message')
     *     instead of
     *   $log->log('message', Zend_Log::PRIORITY_NAME)
     *
     * @param  string  $method  priority name
     * @param  string  $params  message format and values to log
     * @return void
     * @throws Zend_Log_Exception
     */
    public function __call($method, $params)
    {
        $message = array_shift($params);
        $priority = strtoupper($method);
        if (($priority = array_search($priority, $this->_priorities)) !== false) {
            $this->log($message, $priority, $params);
        } else {
            /** @see Zend_Log_Exception */
            require_once 'Zend/Log/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Log_Exception('Bad log priority');
        }
    }

There is merit in the idea, but pushing the responsibility of composing the message behind the Zend\_Log API severely muddies responsibilities of the logging components. The readability win is actually debatable IMO, since methods will any number of arguments can look very different from one invocation to the next, and it may not be clear how the extra parameters are used to the user of the API. Finally, we don't find that '$log->log(sprintf($format, ...), $level)' is either excessively verbose or hard to understand. In fact, it is easier to understand in many ways, since the user now knows precisely how the message will be composed before logging. In other words, we don't have to document how the message is put together in the log() method for users.
