### Description

according to Tom Kite's article "Optimizing PHP and Oracle" ([http://oracle.com/technology/pub/â€¦](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/deployphp/lim_deployphp.html)) i've rewritten the SQL expression in limit method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $limit_sql = "SELECT *
                FROM (
                     SELECT /*+ FIRST_ROWS(" . $offset . ") */
                     ROWNUM AS zend_db_rownum, z1.*
                     FROM (
                          " . $sql . "
                     ) z1
                WHERE ROWNUM <= " . ($offset+$count) . ") WHERE zend_db_rownum >= " . $offset;


way of wrapping is little bit differ and it includes some "tips" to make Oracle build more optimized plan

I can look to this issue but I need more info: - did you implement it in your code? - did you find any performance improvement?
