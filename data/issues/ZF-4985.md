### Description

There was a similar ticket opened which was marked as resolved (ZF-4150), but I am still having the error in ZF 1.7

When setting a translator at the form level, the error messages are all translated for all elements except for the File element

Code to reproduce error, submit the form without selecting a file and you will see the error message remains un-translated:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    
    $translate = new Zend_Translate('array', array(
        Zend_Validate_File_Upload::NO_FILE => 'Test translation',
    ), 'en');
    Zend_Form::setDefaultTranslator($translate);
    
    $form->setAttrib('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');
    
    $form->addElement('file', 'upload', array(
        'label' => 'Upload',
        'required' => true
    ));
    
    $form->addElement('submit', 'save', array(
        'label' => 'Upload'
    ));
    
    if ($this->getRequest()->isPost() && $form->isValid($_POST)) {
        // process form
    }
    
    $this->view->form = $form;
