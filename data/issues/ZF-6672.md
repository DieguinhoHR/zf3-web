### Description

There is an autoloading issue that only occurs when a module bootstrap is loaded. In my case this leads to the following warnings

Warning: include(FrontController.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /path/to/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83

Warning: include() [function.include]: Failed opening 'FrontController.php' for inclusion (include\_path='/path/to/library:.:/usr/local/lib/php') in /path/to/library/Zend/Loader.php on line 83

I could work around this issue, when I set the second parameter of class\_exists to false at Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::getPluginResource() on line 352.

Did you test this against 1.8.2? I think it was resolved already (not sure though).

I have tested this also against 1.8.2 Release (r15776) that I've downloaded today. This only occurs when the fallback autoloader is enabled.

Could you try and reproduce this issue with 1.8.4? The solution to ZF-7002 might have fixed this.

I confirm that the issue is still there in 1.8.4. More here: <http://www.nabble.com/setFallbackAutoloader(true)>-causing-module-boostraps-not-load-td24113679.html#a24113679

Can you confirm against current trunk? I suspect that the fix in ZF-7002 did not make it into 1.8.4 as I don't see that the fix was merged to the 1.8 release branch.

Confirm still an issue under current r16310. ZF-6658 seem to be reporting the same...

Matthew: the merge to release-1.8 is nowhere to be seen in FishEye, but I can see it in the release-1.8 code.

Patch in ZF-7224 applied to trunk and 1.9 release branch.
