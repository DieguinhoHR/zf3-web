ZF-325: fix to HTTP Client ->\_read to handle status lines with missing Reason Phrase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Patch Created: 2006-08-17T14:19:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:18.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.2.0 (29/Oct/06)

### Description

If a response has a status line which is missing a Reason Phrase the current regexp used to match the status in Client-> \_read will fail to match. Although the Reason Phrase does appear to be required (RFC2616) there are some sites that omit it.

See for example the redirect status returned here: <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0875906672/>

In this case \_read fails to get the status and so Client -> get() fails to follow the redirect (since isRedirect() returns false lacking any \_code).

Replacing the existing regexp line in \_read with: if (preg\_match('|HTTP/\\d.\\d (\\d+)\\s?(\\w?)|', $header, $matches)) {

should allow it to correctly extract status even if the Reason Phrase is missing

This issue should be fixed for the incubator HTTP client.

In the mean time, since it's a very simple fix (normally I wouldn't bother about the old client) I tried to apply your patch to the old client but could not reproduce the problem with the URL you sent, so I could not test very well.

Since the patch seems to work, I'm applying it. Please test this as soon as you can and let me know if there's still a problem.
