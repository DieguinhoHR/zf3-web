### Description

Annotations are some kind of objects which are intended to interact with users. There is a large number of standard annotation types provided by PDF: \* Text - "sticky note" attached to specified point in document. \* Link - link to another page or URI. \* Free Text - display text on a page (unlike ordinary text annotation which displays text in a pop-up window). \* Line - line, displayed on a page, opening displays a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. \* Square and Circle - display, respectively, a rectangle or an ellipse on the page. When opened, they display a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. \* Markup - appear as highlights, underlines, strikeouts or jagged ("squiggly") underlines in the text of a document. When opened, they display a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. \* Rubber Stump - displays text or graphics intended to look as if they were stamped on the page with a rubber stamp. When opened, it displays a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. \* Ink - represents a freehand "scribble" composed of one or more disjoint paths. When opened, it displays a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. \* Pop-up - displays text in a pop-up window for entry and editing. Usually appears as child annotation. \* File attachment - reference to embedded file. Allows to store this file in the file system. \* Sound annotation - plays sound when activated. \* Movie - play movie when activated. \* Widget - an interactive form related object. \* Printer's Mark - "a graphic symbol, such as a registration target, color bar, or cut mark, added to a page to assist production personnel in identifying components of a multiple-plate job and maintaining consistent output during production". \* Trap Network - trap networks, associated with a page.

Text, Link, Line, Square and Circle, Murkup, and File Attachment are most usable and easy to implement.
