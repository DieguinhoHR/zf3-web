### Description

The logic in Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate->translate() that allows changing the locale by passing it as the last parameter can cause normal-looking code to inexplicably fail. For example, take the following view code: bq. $this->translate('num %d name %s', $obj->id, $obj->name)

This will generate "vsprintf(): Too few arguments" errors if $obj->name happens to be a valid locale (e.g. "it"). Personally, I think this behavior should be removed since it violates the principle of least surprise, but that would be a BC-break. I think a good compromise would be to have Zend\_View\_Helper\_Translate->translate() do some additional checking and not treat the last parameter as a locale if doing so would cause a "Too few arguments" error. Here's a patch that implements this: <https://gist.github.com/1299031>
