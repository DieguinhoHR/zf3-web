ZF-779: Adding a year in a leap year only adds 365 days
-------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-01-21T03:46:36.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

Consider the following scenario:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-01-01', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    $date->addYear(1);
    print $date->getIso();


Which returns 2008-01-01T06:00:00-06:00.

However, this changes when adding a year to a leap year:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-01-01', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    $date->addYear(1);
    print $date->getIso();


Which returns 2008-12-31T06:00:00-06:00.

It looks like it's adding 365 days instead of 366 during leap years.

This will make a good unit test.

I expect addDay(), addWeek(), addMonth(), etc. exhibit similar behavior as described above.

I already added this test internally... But the change is not as "simple" as expected. I also found an other one, which is related to the same issue in background ( not found until now by users ;-) ).

Have to rework very much to fix this issue. I will need several days so dont be angry if this will last a little but ;-)

Fixed with SVN 3091

This still seems to be an issue. Look at the following example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-02-14', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    $date->addYear(1);
    echo $date->getIso();


returns 2008-02-14T00:00:00+01:00

However, if we cross the end-of-february-border...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-03-14', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    $date->addYear(1);
    echo $date->getIso();


returns 2008-03-13T00:00:00+01:0, which in my eyes is wrong.

If we add a year to 2008-03-14 (while 2008 being a leap year), it adds 366 days. Again, this is wrong. Somehow Zend\_Date should take into account if it crosses the end of february border and not just calculate according to the base year.

Fixed with 3413.

Somehow the change was undo... now it works.

Thanks Thomas for fixing! It works fine now. Just please remove those two debugging lines:

This has already be done with SVN 3424 which solves ZF-912

Thanks for fixing this. I can confirm that addYears works fine in ZF 0.8.0.

However, addMonths still seems to exhibit the same problem:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('2008-01-01', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    print "2008-01-01 => $date\n";
    $date->addMonth(12);
    print "2008-01-01 + 12 months => $date\n";


Returns:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    2008-01-01 => Jan 1, 2008 12:00:00 AM
    2008-01-01 + 12 months => Dec 31, 2008 12:00:00 AM

Please add a new issue the next time... This is not related to adding years but adding months and the year issue was already fixed.

The new added one was fixed with SVN 3674.

Sorry about not opening a new issue. Thanks for fixing this!
