### Description

ArgumentParser does not clear $\_argumentsWorking after parsing the arguments with Zend\_Console\_Getopt.

This causes the parse() method to show a help message and stop the application.

however ignoring side effects and setting $this\_argumentsWorking = array() at the end of \_parseProviderOptionsPart() does solve the problem and the correct parameter is given to my provider.

Using PHP 5.3. Beta 1 and standard incubator from SVN on Mac OS X 10.4 shell:

\# zf show version --mode=mini Unknown arguments left on the command line: --mode=mini

Happend with own providers as well.

The problem now seems to occurs at an other point (with argument still not working in 1.8 Preview).

Might be not an issue anymore.

I am working on this.

Also note, ZF is not PHP 5.3 ready, only PHP 5.2.4+ < 5.3 at this time.

This has been fixed in a previous release, mostly likely r15065 or 15530
