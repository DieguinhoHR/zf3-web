ZF-4496: Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase breaks data provider tests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Data provider tests do not work within test cases that extend Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase. In other test cases extending PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase directly, data providers seem to work fine. Here is a test within the CourseControllerTest class which extends Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase:

 
    /**
     * @dataProvider seedCourses
     * @param string $id
     */
    public function testShowActionWithGetMethodAndIdParameterShouldContainCourseData($id)
    {
        $this->getRequest()->setMethod('GET');
        $this->dispatch('/course/show/' . $id . '/');
        $this->assertResponseCode(200);
    }


And the data provider (also within the CourseControllerTest class):

 
    /**
     * @return array
     */
    public static function seedCourses()
    {
        return array(
            '1'          => array('1'),
            '65535'      => array('FFFF'),
        );
    }


I expect the following when I run the test with "phpunit --testdox":

CourseController [x] Show action with get method and id parameter should contain course data with data set "1" [x] Show action with get method and id parameter should contain course data with data set "65535"

But instead I get:

CourseController [] Show action with get method and id parameter should contain course data

If I run without "--testdox" I see the following error message:

Missing argument 1 for CourseControllerTest::testShowActionWithGetMethodAndIdParameterShouldContainCourseData()

It appears that something within Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase is preventing data provider tests from working correctly and this is just being seen as a "regular" test.

I removed my constructor and now data driven tests work correctly. My constructor did have a call to parent::\_\_construct() so I'm not sure why this makes a difference.

I just tried the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * @dataProvider provider
         */
        public function testIteration($id)
        {
            $url = '/index/index/id/' . $id;
            $this->dispatch($url);
            $this->assertEquals($id, $this->request->getParam('id'));
        }
    
        public function provider()
        {
            return array(
                array(1),
                array(2),
                array(3),
            );
        }


and it worked as expected.

Try adding a constructor and it should break:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function __construct()
        {
            parent::__construct(); 
        }

I just tested, and what you say is true. However, it's also true of _any_ TestCase extending PHPUnit\_Framework\_TestCase -- I verified this by writing the following:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class FooTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function __construct()
        {
            parent::__construct();
        }
    
        /**
         * @dataProvider provider
         */
        public function testProvider($id)
        {
            $this->assertNotNull($id);
        }
    
        public function provider()
        {
            return array(
                array(1),
                array(2),
                array(3),
            );
        }
    }
    ?>


This results in the same error -- "Missing argument 1 for FooTest::testProvider()".

I'm filing a report upstream to the PHPUnit project.

A ticket already exists for it: <http://www.phpunit.de/ticket/602>

I re-opened the ticket, which was closed for PHPUnit 3.3.4, after verifying that the code still does not work as expected. Please track the PHPUnit ticket for updates, as this is an upstream issue, and not a ZF issue.

Also see <http://www.phpunit.de/ticket/824>, which has disabled the functionality to print the data set information.
