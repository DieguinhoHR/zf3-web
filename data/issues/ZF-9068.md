### Description

In the File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract class there's a function called \_detectMimeType(). This function uses the finfo class to get the files mime type. If your magic libraries are in an atypical place you need to enter the libraries' location as the classes second parameter. In the \_detectMimeType() function this is done by using the $magicFile variable (if it's set). However the variable is never set and can't be set anywhere other than by inserting a dirty hack in the function...
