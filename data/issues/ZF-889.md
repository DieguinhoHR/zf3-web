### Description

Currently only INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN is supported in Zend\_Db\_Select.

Add methods joinRight(), joinFull(), joinCross(), and joinNatural().

For methods joinCross() and joinNatural(), no $cond parameter is needed (though the SQL standard permits a condition for these joins too).

It is not required to support natural joins other than inner joins.

Implemented in revision 3320.

New methods joinRight(), joinFull(), joinCross(), and joinNatural() are in Zend\_Db\_Select and do the appropriate thing.
