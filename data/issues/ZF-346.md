ZF-346: Implement Zend\_Hash from Zend\_Config
----------------------------------------------

### Description

As Zend\_Config provides a property based interface to an array, we should rename it Zend\_Hash.

We then need a new Zend\_Config with a single factory method:

class Zend\_config { static public function factory($adapterName, $adapterConfig = array(), $allowModifications = false); }

Pasting Rob's message to fw-general:

The idea is that Zend\_Config is renamed to Zend\_Hash and a new Zend\_Config is written that mimics Zend\_Db's factory().

The rationale is already in the comments for Zend\_Config:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Zend_Config provides a property based interface to
         * an array. The data are read only unless $allowModifications
         * is set to true on construction.
         *
         * Zend_Hash [sic] also implements Countable and Iterator to
         * facilitate easy access to the data.


The new interface to Zend\_Config will be pretty much identical to how Zend\_Db's factory() works:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapterConfig = array($filename, $section);
    $config = Zend_Config::factory('INI', $adapterConfig,
                  $allowModifications);


(The returned $config is of type Zend\_Hash.)

This would mean that the current method of creating a Zend\_Config would no longer work. i.e.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $config = new Zend_Config(new Zend_Config_Ini(...));


would fail and you would need to change the code to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $config = new Zend_Hash(new Zend_Config_Ini(...));

As discussed on the mailing list, Zend\_Hash is the wrong name! Need a better one...

The current consensus is that we need not extract the referred functionality from Zend\_Config into a separate "container" component intended to provide appropriate functionality for the generalized problem. Other framework components and applications are instead encouraged to implement such functionality according to their own specific needs, and opportunities for refactoring can be examined later with respect to actual needs.

I was re-reading the lists again today and I thought common consensus was that a primitive container _was_ a good idea. It had comments from Christopher, myself, Ralph, Ralf, Nico, Alexander and Matthew that indicated a more positive impression.

I think Christopher's summary was pretty good. All it needs is:-

- property access \_\_get()/\_\_set()/\_\_isset() and get()/set()/has()
- array access and iteration
- allows control of the types of variables that can be stored
- allows overwrite or no-overwrite
- allows duplicates or no duplicates (mainly for objects)

...and currently Zend\_Config has most of that.

Rob - have you progressed on any of the refactoring you had mentioned? I would be keen to rework ACL/Environment in the meantime to perform some preliminary testing on the suitability of Zend\_Hash/Zend\_Container/Zend\_Array
