### Description

I know this component is in the incubator but I just checked out it to play with it but I had some problems getting it to run.

Attached is my patches to make it runnable. They are also posted to github here <http://gist.github.com/86836>

Thanks for the patch, actually until now I did _never_ run any code of Zend\_Tag\_Cloud, just wrote it down all the way. After the API is approved, I will (unit)test the entire beast and then get rid of all those little errors here and there ;)

I assumed it was under heavy development, just patched it to be able to play with it my self. Looks neat from what I have seen to far though. Keep up the good work.

All unit tests done (and all non-working code fixed for sure)
