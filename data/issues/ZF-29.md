### Description

In the setFrom method of the Zend\_Mail class, I would like to have another parameter accepting the platform of the mail server :

ex.:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail->setFrom("test@test.com", "test", "unix");
    
    or
    
    $mail->setFrom("test@test.com", "test", "windows");


because my version of Microsoft Exchange does not accept the format of "From test [test@test.com](mailto:test@test.com)" it only accept the "From test@test.com".

{quote} \* owner changed from zend to matthew. \* status changed from new to assigned.

Instead of an additional parameter, a new 'Exchange' transport may be the better option. Are there any other differences in how Exchange handles headers (To, Cc, Bcc, Subject, etc.) of which you are aware? {quote}

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
