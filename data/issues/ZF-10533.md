I've attached a patch for this component's test suite which illustrates the issue. Here is the resulting testdox when I run those tests:

 
    <pre class="literal">
     [x] Php locale en string type handles comma separator followed by two digits correctly
     [ ] Php locale en string type handles comma separator followed by three digits correctly
     [x] Php locale en string type handles comma separator followed by four digits correctly
     [x] Php locale en string type handles non zero number followed by comma separator followed by two digits correctly
     [ ] Php locale en string type handles non zero number followed by comma separator followed by three digits correctly
     [x] Php locale en string type handles non zero number followed by comma separator followed by four digits correctly

I'm not entirely certain this is a bug. The string '0,666' is a valid number (666), it's just that common convention would omit the '0,' as it's meaningless. I'm not sure where that fits into the maintainer's vision of how Zend\_Validate\_Float should work.

Zend\_Validate\_Float::isValid() uses Zend\_Locale\_Data::isFloat(), which itself is just an alias of Zend\_Locale\_Data::isNumber(), which checks the number against the formats 'decimalnumber' and 'scientificnumber' in Zend/Locale/Data/en.xml:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    #,##0.####E0

Zend Framework defers this type of validation to Unicode's CLDR (<http://cldr.unicode.org>). If you feel that the issue you have outlined here is indeed a bug which needs fixing, I would submit a bug report in CLDR's trac system at <http://unicode.org/cldr/trac>

According to the numeric rules in english a "," is treated as separator for thousand and above. Each 3 digits "can" be combined in a block separated by a ",".

This means that values like "0,666" are logically converted into "666" as 0 for thousand is allowed and correct. It is allowed to have integer values within the float validator because integers are just a special variant of float values (en => 0,666 = 666 = 666.0)

Therefor this is not an issue but expected behaviour. As Adam said: When you feel that this is an failure in it's handling feel free to open a bug at unicode.
