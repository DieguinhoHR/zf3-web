Different browsers have different default behaviors about what to do when the user hits enter in a form. MSIE almost always submits the form, while Netscape will often just beep at you. Although it's usually best to leave the default browser behavior as it is, for some forms people just naturally tend to hit "enter" when they are ready. This is particularly true for login forms. With a little JavaScript we can set the form to submit on enter.

i see, but if i use a old-styled html form the form submits on hitting the enter-button in firefox too... bot not the dojo-version of submit-button (i converted a working form from old to dojo form)

Yes, this is strange. It works with plain old forms but not with Dojo forms on Firefox.

maybe a dojo problem?
