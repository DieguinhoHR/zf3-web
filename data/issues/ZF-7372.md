ZF-7372: Zend\_Tool fails when Custom Providers are defined with multiple parameters that start with the same letter

### Description

You are not able to name parameters starting with the same first letter.

If a method is defined as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function foo($testvar, $testVariable)


This will result in the following error:

An Error Has Occurred Option "-t" is being defined more than once.

As these are two separate parameters, it would be expected that the method declaration would be valid.
