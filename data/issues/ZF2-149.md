### Description

Steps to reproduce \* Create a new SkeletonApplication \* Add a new route to Application module:

 
    <pre class="highlight">         'test' => array(
                'type' => 'Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\Segment',
                'options' => array(
                    'route'    => '/test[/:id]',
                    'defaults' => array(
                        'controller' => 'index',
                        'action'     => 'index',
                        'id'        => 0
                    ),
                ),
            ),

- Modify IndexController::indexAction to retrieve the parameter "id"
 

    <pre class="highlight">
    * echo $id and exit
    * Create a new request to http:///test/1
    
    Expected result:
    The number 1 should be displayed
    
    Actual result:
    Nothing is displayed
    
    Additional information:
    It looks like Zend\Mvc\Router\SimpleRouteStack and inheritors ignore the accumulated request assembledParams in a matched Route\Segment.
    
    Proposed solution:
    Add


to Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\SimpleRouteStack line 267 (in match() method, after the foreach loop ends) Note that this same solution may apply to Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\TreeRouteStack for applications with a baseUrl

Althought it would be a simple way to extract them, you can extract them right now if your controller implements the InjectApplicationEvent, then you can retrieve the MVC Event, and extract the route matches:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $Match = $this->getEvent()->getRouteMatch();
    $Id = $Match->getParam('id', 0);

The proposed solution breaks other functionality: existing params in the query are lost. The following change merges both params: $request->setQuery(new \\Zend\\Stdlib\\Parameters(array\_merge($match->getParams(), $request->query()->toArray())));

It would be great if somebody from zf could comment on this.

Route parameters are _not_ query parameters, so this issue is basically invalid. What is correct is that we had Request::getParam() before, which combined all parameter sources (user params, get, post, cookie, etc.). This may return at a later point, but is not related to this issue. So right now you would do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->getRequest()->getRouteMatch()->getParam('id');

What you probably meant is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->getEvent()->getRouteMatch()->getParam('id');
