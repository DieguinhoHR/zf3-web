ZF-6932: Zend Loader trying to instantiate wrong class

### Description

Since upgrading from ZF 1.7.5 -> 1.8.2 and implementing the new Zend\_Loader I'm getting strange compile errors e.g. Compile Error: /usr/local/ZWare/lib/Zend/Log.php line 223 - Cannot redeclare class ZWare\_Service\_Log

I see these through Zend Studio debugger.

This is happening with a lot of my classes that have similar names to existing Zend classes. The failure line is always the last line in the file.

It seems that Zend\_Loader is confusing names.

My loader initialisation lines in bootstrap are: require\_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php'; $autoloader = Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::getInstance(); $autoloader->setFallbackAutoloader(true);

where previously (in 1.7.5) I used to simply have require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload();

This is really messing up my ability to debug code as I rarely get to the target page before one of these errors gets thrown. I don't really want to have to go writing my own autoloaders 'cus the old style one worked just fine.

Can you suggest some testing I can do to try and narrow down the problem?

BTW, If I run the app without going through the debugger, all appears fine (assuming of course I have no other issues stopping execution.)

TIA

The error you're getting, "Cannot redeclare class ZWare\_Service\_Log", is indicative of one of two issues. First, as the error suggest, PHP may be trying to include the same class file twice. This causes PHP to error as it's attempting to redefine an existing class. This could be happening if you have a call to "include 'ZWare/Service/Log.php';" That said, Zend\_Loader::loadClass() (which is still used internally in Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader) does a class\_exists() check prior to calling include() -- which could mean there's a circular dependency happening in the included class file.

The second possibility is that you're using an opcode cache, and the realpath cache is stale. This would also result in the same error. The easy way to test this theory is to flush your opcode cache or disable it to see if the issue goes away.

Finally, instead of using setFallbackAutoloader(), register your namespace with it instead:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $autoloader->registerNamespace('Zware_');


This is the more appropriate and intended way of using the autoloader, as it will then ignore namespaces it does not know about.

(BTW, as of 1.8.2, Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload() now uses Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader and sets it as a fallback autoloader -- but also emits a deprecation warning.)

Matthew - thanks.

re: trying to include same class file twice. I thought that, but it is the underlying Zend Framework code that is throwing the error - it knows nothing about my stuff above it. I don't use 'include/require' statements anywhere in my code apart from the one line that includes the loader in the bootstrap.

re: circular references. Nope, ZWare\_Service\_Log extends a simpleton factory class. It does instantiate Zend\_Log and stores it to do the actual work. Zend\_Log of course knows nothing about ZWare\_Service\_Log

re: opcode cache. Not knowingly using one of them unless Zend Core implements one that I don't know about.

re: using $autoloader->registerNamespace('Zware\_'); Tried that as suggested. Now I get errors along lines of Class 'ZWare\_...' not found (doesn't even get out of the bootstrap.) I guess 'cus the autoloader now doesn't know what to do with it.

re: Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload(). It was the deprecation notices that prompted me to use the new form. Going back to use Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload() form is not a starter 'cus as you say, it is really a wrapper for the new functionality (and yes, I get the original error as reported if I do.)

Thanks for suggestions, I'll take another look.

APC and eAccelerator would be examples of opcode caches.
