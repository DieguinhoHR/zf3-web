### Description

It would be great to have an 'init' method to use for overridden objects so that the constructor doesn't need to be altered.

Assign to me.

Categorize as Zend\_Db\_Table.

This would be a very simple addition to each of the classes, but what is an example use case for it? I can't think of any.

Having a clear use case is important, but as a side comment I want to point out that although one could write a solution as follows with no "hooks":

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyTable extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
      public function __construct($options)
      {
        // pre-init code
        parent::__construct($options);
        // post-init code
      }
    }


However, "Call Super" is considered an anti-pattern: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call\_super](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_super)

Assigning to [~peptolab] to be resolved with the approved Zend\_Db\_Table enhancements proposal.
