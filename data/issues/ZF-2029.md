### Description

When using the formRadio helper, I noticed that the various options are listed with a "  
" tag to separate them. As a result, the options are listed one below the other. This is a problem for who wants the options listed on one row. This tag should be removed. It is CSS's job to display these elements as "block".

It is not a bug. The formRadio method have a parameter called '$listsep' and this parameter have the value '  
\\n' as initial value.

If you don't need to use this parameter, you can simply pass NULL as this parameter value.

Below is an example of the method's signature:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     public function formRadio($name, $value = null, $attribs = null,
            $options = null, $listsep = "<br></br>\n")
        {
             // The method definition is here.
        }

We can change the parameter $listsep default value to NULL. I will made this change on SVN later as a suggestion to te core developers.

Ok thanks, I think it better, as you said, to set the default value to NULL. And also, the manual should be updated, as now this helper is listed as:

formRadio($name, $value, $attribs, $options)
