### Description

(Incubator revision: 1872)

The preDispatch() method of a Zend\_Controller\_Action object can request an action name from $this->getRequest()->getActionName(). But sometimes this is not the action name the dispatcher is going to call, because in the current dispatcher's implementation the \_dispatch() method can decide to call at least getDefaultAction() instead of the requested action name.

I suggest to change in Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher::\_dispatch() $controller->preDispatch(); to $controller->preDispatch($action); or $controller->preDispatch(substr($action, 0, -6)); // remove trailing 'Action'

New method signature of Zend\_Controller\_Action::preDispatch() could be public function preDispatch($actualActionName)

Btw. there is a difference in the flow between dispatcher's \_dispatch() and controller's run(). \_dispatch() determines the action name before calling preDispatch(). run() gets the action name after preDispatch(), so in this case preDispatch() is able to change the request and hence the called action.

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.

Good catch. I'll have the dispatcher set the action name in the request object if it uses the default action; this will require no change to signatures, and will allow the preDispatch() and actual action method to have access to the final action name as dispatched.

Regarding Zend\_Controller\_Action::run() vs. the dispatcher: this is intentional, as they serve two different purposes. run() should only ever be used when using Zend\_Controller\_Action as a Page Controller, in which case if preDispatch() changes the action name, that will be the new action called.

Resolved in revision 1916. Sets $request->setActionName() with the new value if the default action name is used.
