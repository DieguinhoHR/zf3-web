### Description

It's strange, isn't it?

abstract class Zend\_Db\_Table { ... static protected $\_inflector; ... public function \_\_construct($config = null) { ... self::$\_inflector = new Zend\_Db\_Inflector(); ... }

Everytimes when we create a new table descendent instance, new Inflector will create and replace old one.

Question #2: Why Inflector is not a static object? It isn't consist any properties.

I don't understand this things.

Recategorize as Zend\_Db\_Table component.

As of revision 3995, Zend\_Db\_Table no longer uses inflectors.
