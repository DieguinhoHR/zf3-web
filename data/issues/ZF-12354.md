### Description

When i go to create a new row $model->createRow(); if my array has a key with false value it's change to null.

So if I save it and the field at the database don't accept null value, i get an error.

You must manually cast the value to whatever your database expects. This is not the responsibility of Zend Framework.

For example to cast to an ENUM value "true" or "false", you can do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $x = false;
    $foo->createRow(
        array(
           'baz' => $x ? 'true' : 'false'
        )
    );


Or to cast to an integer:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $x = false;
    $foo->createRow(
        array(
           'baz' => (int) $x
        )
    );


Closing this issue.

I'm already doing like this, convert to a string, But it's not nice.

I've made some test's an seems to me that is a PHP bug at \_\_set, i have made some var\_dump's over there.
