### Description

I have posted this to the fw-general list before and it is still not fixed in r3503. Tested on PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1

Zend\_Mail strips down empty newlines in the message body set by setBodyText():

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail();
    $mail->setSubject('my subject');
    $mail->setBodyText("my body\r\n\r\n...after two newlines");
    $mail->setFrom('info@onlime.ch');
    $mail->addTo('test@email.com');
    // print_r($mail);
    $mail->send();


A print\_r($mail) before sending the mail looks correct:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
        [_bodyText:protected] => Zend_Mime_Part Object
            (
                [type] => text/plain
                [encoding] => quoted-printable
                [id] => 
                [disposition] => inline
                [filename] => 
                [description] => 
                [charset] => iso-8859-1
                [boundary] => 
                [_content:protected] => my body
    
    ...after two newlines
                [_isStream:protected] => 
            )
    ...


In the resulting email the empty newline is cut down though and we get:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    my body
    ...after two newlines

What transport are you using? SMTP or the default?

I'm using default transport, mail gets send over the mail()-function in Zend\_Mail\_Transport\_Sendmail::\_sendMail() as far as I know. Same applies to issue [#ZF-928].

besides, I have tested it on both Win32 and Debian Linux under PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1

I've committed a patch to Zend\_Mime, Zend\_Mime\_Part, and Zend\_Mime\_Message that should correct the issue; please test and confirm.

Sorry Matthew to disappoint you. Now it even seems to be worse.

"my body\\r\\n\\r\\n...after two newlines" on win32, result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">my body
    ...after two newlines

"my body\\r\\n\\r\\n...after two newlines" on linux, result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">my body
    
    
    
    ...after two newlines

4 newlines!, while the \\r seems to get encoded to a weird character, source of email:

 
    <pre class="highlight">my body=0D
    =0D
    ...after two newlines

"my body\\n\\n...after two newlines" on linux, result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">my body
    ...after two newlines

Hi Phillip - has this been resolved for you with the more recent svn commits?

 

 

Posted by Philip Iezzi (iezzip) on 2007-03-14T17:43:37.000+0000

Yep! This seems to be resolved in the current trunk.
