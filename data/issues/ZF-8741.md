ZF-8741: Zend\_Cache\_Core::getIdsMatchingAnyTags() not implemented
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Cache backends implementing the extended interface all have a getIdsMatchingAnyTags() method. However, this is not implemented in Zend\_Cache\_Core, so the backend method can not be called.

A new method Zend\_Cache\_Core::getIdsMatchingAnyTags() should be created similar to Zend\_Cache\_Core::getIdsMatchingTags().

Thank You for report, I will be happy if You try trunk code ( SVN r20815)

The impementation looks fine.

However, there ought to be unit tests that test calling all extended backend functions through Zend\_Cache\_Core, not just load, save, test, clean. And that would mean having Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Test implement the extended interface to make those methods available.

I could do that if there's interest for it.

Yes, it's right, Sven. We should implement missing test and do several changes that the test needs.
