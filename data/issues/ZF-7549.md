### Description

I submitted a couple of hours ago issue ZF-7545 which has been resolved since then but I noticed that the same problem occurs in the following classes (for the addPrefixPath method) : \* Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract \* Zend\_Form \* Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha

Other classes having this method are not affected.
