### Description

Currently Zend\_OpenId\_Extension is passed the OpenId parameters as a single level array in which the periods have been replaced with underscores. This makes parsing the parameters much harder than it should be. If rather than replacing the periods with underscores, the parameters were used to generate a multi-level array it would greatly enhance the parsing of parameters by extensions. Here is some code that will do exactly what I have described. There is probably a faster and better way to generate this array but...oh well.

function splitParams($params) { $final = array();

 
    // Loop the parameters
    foreach ($params as $identifier => $value)
    {
        // Split the identifier at the boundries
        $levels = explode('.', $identifier);
    
        // Get the last value as the key
        $key = array_pop($levels);
    
        // Loop the levels, creating any that don't exist
        $currentlevel = &$final;
        foreach ($levels as $level)
        {
            // Check if the level is defined
            if (!isset($currentlevel[$level]))
                // Create the level
                $currentlevel[$level] = array();
            else
            {
                // Change any found value to the first key of an array
                if (!is_array($currentlevel[$level]))
                    $currentlevel[$level] = array($currentlevel[$level]);
            }
    
            // Move down to the next level
            $currentlevel = &$currentlevel[$level];
        }
    
        // Set the value
        $currentlevel[$key] = $value;
    }
    
    return $final;


}
