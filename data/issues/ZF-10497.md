### Description

This is not a major issue but I have had the need to check an email address against two different database tables. I added both to a form element, see below, but only one was checked. I had a quick look at the source code and discovered that the validator's name is used as the key in the validator list, hence why only the last database validator worked.

The work around for this was simple as I just added a second check after the initial form validation.

The form element:

$email\_address = new Zend\_Form\_Element\_Text('email\_address'); $email\_address->setLabel('Email address:') ->setRequired(true) ->setAttrib('size', 50) ->addErrorMessage('You must specify a valid email address') ->addFilter('StringTrim') ->addFilter('StripNewlines') ->addFilter('StripTags') ->addValidator('NotEmpty', true) ->addValidator('EmailAddress', true, array( 'deep' => true, 'allow' => Zend\_Validate\_Hostname::ALLOW\_DNS, 'mx' => true)) ->addValidator('Db\_NoRecordExists', true, array( 'adapter' => Zend\_Registry::get('mydb'), 'field' => 'email\_address', 'table' => 'site\_users', 'setMessage' => array('recordFound' => 'This email address is already registered!'))) ->addValidator('Db\_NoRecordExists', true, array( 'adapter' => Zend\_Registry::get('mydb'), 'field' => 'email\_address', 'table' => 'site\_agencies', 'setMessage' => array('recordFound' => 'This email address is already registered!')));

The workaround: I removed the last validator from the code above and added into my controller script

$request = $this->getRequest(); $form = new Form\_MyForm(null);

if($request->isPost()){ if($form->isValid($this->\_request->getPost())){ $email\_address = $this->\_request->getParam('email\_address'); $validator = new Zend\_Validate\_Db\_NoRecordExists(array( 'adaptor' => Zend\_Registry::get('seevee'), 'table' => 'site\_agencies', 'field' => 'agency\_email\_address')); if ($validator->isValid($email\_address)) { // valid } else { // invalid $this->view->errorMessage = ' There has been a problem with the form you submitted  
 Please correct the errors below to continue'; } }  
 }

I know this is only trivial but you may wish to look into this sometime.

Kind regards Garry
