Fixed a part of this issue in SVN r8735. I edit Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field and Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document. Do you have any idea of docs about Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_LockManager? Can I get from Apache Lucene API Doc?

Resolved in SVN r8952

I'm assuming this fix is merged to the 1.5 release branch for release with 1.5.1. Please update JIRA if this is not the case.

I do not find it ver1.5.1 . Please merge r8735 and r8952 to 1.5 branch
