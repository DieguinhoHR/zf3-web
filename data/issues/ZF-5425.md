### Description

Zend\_Acl manual states that:

{quote} The assert() method of an assertion object is passed the ACL, role, resource, and privilege to which the authorization query (i.e., isAllowed()) applies, in order to provide a context for the assertion class to determine its conditions where needed. {quote}

That is not true! When assertion is attached to global "all-roles" pseudo-parent in on ACL tree with:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $acl::allow(null,null,null,new MyAssertion());


... with the assertion built like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class MyAssertion implements Zend_Acl_Assert_Interface {
        public function assert(Zend_Acl $acl,
                    Zend_Acl_Role_Interface $role = null,
                    Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface $resource = null,
                    $privilege = null)
        {
            if($role == 'someRole') return true;
            elseif($resource == 'someBannedResource') return false;        
            else return true;
        }   
    }


... Then after a query:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     $acl->isAllowed('someRole','someResource','somePermission');


... the assertion _should_ be called with

assert(Zend\_Acl object, 'somerole', 'someResource', 'somePermission').

Instead it is called with

assert(Zend\_Acl object, null, null, null)

There is a fix in place in trunk at r17317 for ZF-1721 & ZF-1722 that I think will fix this issue, please test.
