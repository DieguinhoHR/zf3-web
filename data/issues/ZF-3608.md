### Description

It would be nice if Zend\_Json\_Server::setClass() would be like SoapServer::setClass() or the XmlRpc or Rest servers setClass() methods. E.g. SoapServer, from what I've seen has the method setClass(string class\_name[, mixed args]), which allows things such as: $server->setClass("my\_class", $constructor\_arg\_1, $constructor\_arg\_2, etc) Or, are you going to only allow classes with static methods, or with no arguments needed to be passed to their constructor? This would seem odd, because you do have the namespace, and the argv arguments to setClass(), so I wouldn't see the point in having them, if they weren't being used.

Thank you

This functionality is now available in trunk, and will be released with 1.7.0.
