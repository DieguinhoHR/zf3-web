### Description

The zend captch class is great but there should be an option to change captcha image background color and font color. Upto Zend version 1.11 there is no option to change this property. if you want to change these property then you have to change the \_generateImage function in Image.php.

I hope this may be useful in anyway to solve this issue

It seems like there are many users looking forward to have Zend\_Captcha\_Image been improved.

What I do not understand is what it is good for defining a $\_startImage when it gets overlayed by a rectangle filled with the background color. Maybe it would be better to use imagecolorallocatealpha() instead of imagecolorallocate() or to leave the background alone if a startImage is set.

I think Sandras code is a great step for enhancing Zend\_Captcha\_Image but as mentioned above, I would prefer using imagecolorallocatealpha() and having a fourth parameter for the alpha.

Thanks Stanislav for reading this.
