### Description

I tried to send an email with Zend\_Mail and changed from sendmail to smtp. I got an HTTP 501 error and the Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract class throws an Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception exception which has not been loaded before. The Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract class misses a require\_once('Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php');

Which line is the exception thrown from?

I think this issue can changed to "closed" because I used the Zend\_Mail component wrong. I checked my code with the implementation of others and fixed it by myself. Sorry for this issue, that was only my fault.

Bookkeeping. Assigning closed and resolved issues to those who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
