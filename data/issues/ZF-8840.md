### Description

generated in config: resources.layout.layoutPath = "APPLICATION\_PATH "/layouts/scripts/""

I think it should be: resources.layout.layoutPath = APPLICATION\_PATH "/layouts/scripts/"

I'm experiencing the same problem. The application does not seem to recognize the resources.layout.layoutPath value after enabling layout.

Steps to reproduce:

zf show version
===============

Zend Framework Version: 1.10.0beta1

mkdir ZendToolBug
=================

cd ZendToolBug
==============

zf create project .
===================

zf enable layout
================

cat application/configs/application.ini
=======================================

... resources.layout.layoutPath = "APPLICATION\_PATH "/layouts/scripts/"" ...

Expected result:

resources.layout.layoutPath = APPLICATION\_PATH "/layouts/scripts/"

Actual result:

resources.layout.layoutPath = "APPLICATION\_PATH "/layouts/scripts/""

Fixed on Trunk in [r20349](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=20349) and merged to release-1.10 branch as [r20350](http://framework.zend.com/code/changelog/Zend_Framework?cs=20350)

This appears to be fixed for me in 1.10.0rc1.
