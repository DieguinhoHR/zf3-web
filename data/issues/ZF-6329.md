ZF-6329: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract's \_getCols method returns unexpected results when it goes against metadata cache and the \_schema ivar isn't set

### Description

The public info() method in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract calls \_getCols, which returns unexpected column names if two different tables with the same name exist in two different schemas, and one is already cached, because of the way the table cache key is generated in \_setupMetadata().

The table cache key in \_setupMetadata is generated using the \_schema ivar set in the table instance, which is usually 'null' if a programmer doesn't go to the trouble of explicitly setting it by passing the corresponding key-value pair to the constructor. If this behavior is intended, it's extremely counterintuitive, as I would expect the table to know well enough to cache using the schema specified in the adapter when appropriate.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Call Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::setDefaultMetadataCache(). 2) Instantiate Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract with table name `foo`, with an adapter for schema `bar`, without explicitly setting the schema in the table constructor. 3) Instantiate Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract with table name `foo`, with an adapter for schema `baz`, without explicitly setting the schema in the table constructor. 4) Call info() on the baz.foo table, and look at the columns that are returned. They are the columns that belong to bar.foo ...

Recommendations:

The schema from the adapter should supersede the table schema in \_setupMetadata() if the table schema is null.
