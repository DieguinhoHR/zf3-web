Hi, Piotr.

If you use Zend Guard 5.01 and Zend Studio , I can try to reproduce it for you.

Can you tell me following infos?

Zend\_Guard or Zend Encoder version Zend\_Framework version php version, OS, etc..

Zend Guard (PHP 5) v5.0.0 file is taken from trunk, revision 6332 OS linux, kernel 2.6.9 if it makes a difference

Hi, Piotr.

6332 is revision of the Zend/Db/Table/Row/Abstract.php ? If so, I think you may use 1.0.1 of Zend Framework Version.

I suggest you should use latest Zend Framework Version , 1.7.8, Because many issue have fixed from 1.0.1 to 1.7.8 .

With KIng Wishes.

My bad, the revision is 14662.

I took 6332 from file header, and later i noticed that file has not svn:keywords set on, and this value is not updated @version $Id: Abstract.php 6332 2007-09-13 00:35:08Z bkarwin $

So as summary, the revision is 14662

Hi, Piotr.

I confirm your report with following.

Zend Framework revison - 14667 from trunk (05/April/2009) Zend Guard 5.0.1 Delete phpdoc block - No Delete line number - No hard to read variables - No hard to read functions - No hard to read classes - No

I find the same error message on below.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $newPrimaryKey = array(current((array) $this->_primary) => $primaryKey);


I will change it as following. It could be good.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $tempPrimaryKey = (array) $this->_primary;
    $newPrimaryKey = array(current($tempPrimaryKey) => $primaryKey);
