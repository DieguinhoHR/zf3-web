### Description

The tokenizer in Zend\_Reflection\_File ignores T\_INTERFACE so it is not possible to reflect interfaces within files at the moment. Zend\_Reflection\_Class inherits ReflectionClass thus it should be possible to reflect interfaces.

Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Class assumes that Zend\_Reflection\_Class is always a class. So it is not possible to generate an interface.

Your fix for Zend\_Reflection\_File is fine.

The other part of the issue concerning Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Class seems to be still existing. Shall I open another issue for that?

The problem is that Zend\_CodeGenerator assumes that Zend\_Reflection\_Class is always a class not an interface. If you try to generate an interface with Zend\_CodeGenerator\_File parsed via Zend\_Reflection\_File you will encounter some problems.

Zend\_CodeGenerator\_File::fromReflection() does not set the filename. I think

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    following the line with 

will fix that.
