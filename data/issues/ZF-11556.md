ZF1 uses PHPUnit >= 3.4.0; the assertions marked as deprecated have all occurred in PHPUnit's 3.5 branch. As such, this is a fix we're only targetting for ZF2 (and we've converted most such assertions at this time).

didn't know unit tests kept backward compatible with previous releases of PHPUnit.

What is the best way to check if test 3.4.0 compatible? Checking PHPUnit docs everytime isn't very handy.
