### Description

Using either the Google provided example that works with the framework, or a contrived example if you call getBaseFeed() on the Zend\_Gdata\_Base() instance the HTTP client fails with an exception...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Invalid chunk size "58A" unable to read chunked body
    
    ...\Zend\Http\Client\Adapter\Socket.php (212)
    
    #0 ...\Zend\Http\Client.php(729): Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Socket->read()
    #1 ...\Zend\Feed.php(184): Zend_Http_Client->request('GET')
    #2 ...\Zend\Gdata.php(121): Zend_Feed::import('<a href="http://www.goog">http://www.goog</a>...')
    #3 ...\Zend\Gdata\Base.php(108): Zend_Gdata->getFeed('<a href="http://www.goog">http://www.goog</a>...')
    #4 ... Zend_Gdata_Base->getBaseFeed()


Tried using Client Login method of authentication...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $email = 'something@gmail.com';
    $passwd = 'somepass';
    $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($email, $passwd);
    $gdataBase = new Zend_Gdata_Base($client);
    $gdataBase->setDeveloperKey('...');
    $gdataBase->setQuery('digital camera');
    $feed = $gdataBase->getBaseFeed(); 


Affects 0.7.0 and the tip from SVN as-of February 5, 2007

The provided Base-AuthSub.php sample exhibits the same behavior when you fix the bug in the call to get the feed passing in an URI or calling for the base feed.

I cannot reproduce this error. I confirmed that the Http Client is executing the code from which your error message is generated. That is, in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Socket::read(), in the block that handles responses with the transfer-encoding header == 'chunked'. But it works for me and does not produce an error.

Is this error reproduceable in your environment?

I have noticed that sometimes Google's servers don't always respond perfectly.

This has received no update in a long time, and the recent redesign of Zend\_Gdata may resolve any problems.

I presume this issue has to do with an issue I'm trying to submit at the moment. It gives the same error but with Zend\_Feed (that uses Zend\_Http\_Client).

- After some investigation the problem turns out to be a case-sensitivity differance in the variables in line 222 and 223: {quote} $chunksize = hexdec(chop($line)); if (dechex($chunksize) != $hexchunksize) { {quote}

As a workarround I alter the setting of the $hexchunksize variable in line 220: {quote} $hexchunksize = strlen($hexchunksize) ? _strtolower_($hexchunksize) : 0; {quote}
