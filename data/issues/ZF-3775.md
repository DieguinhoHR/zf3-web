ZF-3775: DbSelect adapter not returning Rowsets on Db\_Table\_Select
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

It is currently not possible to retrieve a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset from Zend\_Paginator. This is due to the fact that it's not possible to get the table instance from a Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select query. A workaround for this problem could be an additional setTable() method in the DbSelect adapter. If a table is provided using this method, the DbSelect adapter will return a Rowset.

Added proposed patch. The patch proposes an opt-out situation. Suggestion from zftalk.dev:

ESL|Stalker: cenuij, ralphschindler, norm2782: suggestion: opt-in in 1.6.2, opt-out in 1.7?
