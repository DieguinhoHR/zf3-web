### Description

I've built a custom session handler using Zend\_Table and discovered that I can't use any Zend objects within the session-write call. I know that manual says:

"...It is possible to call session\_write\_close() from the destructor to solve this chicken and egg problem."

However, there seems to be no documentation on calling sequences of destructors and I couldn't find a single suitable destructor to place a session\_write\_close() such that it didn't throw and unknow exception".

Here is the handler:

/\*\* \* Write session data \* \* @param string $sid Session Id \* @param string $sdata Serialized $\_SESSION array \*/ public function callbackWrite($sid, $sdata) { if ($this->session != null) { /\* we found a session, now update it \*/ $this->session->varData = $sdata; $this->session->expire = date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time() + $this->maxlifetime);

 
            Zend_Log::log("Mobile_Session::callbackWrite($sid, $sdata), session found, updating.", Zend_Log::LEVEL_DEBUG);
            return ($this->session->save() == 1) ? true : false;
        }
        else
        {
            Zend_Log::log("Mobile_Session::callbackWrite($sid, $sdata), session object does not exist.", Zend_Log::LEVEL_ERROR);
            return false;
        }
    }


Note that $this->session is Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row object and it's save() method fails. Additionally the log adapter is closed as well.

Is this a bug or is there a solution to this?
