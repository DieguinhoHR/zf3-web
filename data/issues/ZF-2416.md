Re-opening -- need to add i18n and use cases.

Documentation is updated to reflect current code, and includes sections on I18n and several advanced use cases. Cases I'd like to see, but which I have not completed and do not see as must-haves, include:

- Performing AJAX server-side validation
- Form using AutoComplete (probably should be on AutoComplete docs)
- Advanced decorator ordering

Closing, as essential (and some advanced use cases) are now done.
