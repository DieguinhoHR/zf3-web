The problem was in the lazy $\_browser and $\_environment class members initialization based on the $\_auto value. (see Zend\_Locale::isLocale() method).

$\_auto is actually initialized early (in the Zend\_Locale constructor).

So $\_browser and $\_environment were never initialised.

I also found getDefault(), getEnvironment() and getBrowser() methods dont have to be static.

Thomas, please review this patch (CS-10029) and conform if it's OK

Have to check implementation myself as it changes the base class complete.
