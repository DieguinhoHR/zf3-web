### Description

Scenario: you have a "Projects" controller in your application as well as in an "admin" module.

When I create a controller for a module through the zf command on the command line, it will overwrite an existing ProjectsControllerTest for the application controller with an empty/stubbed test case class of the same name.

Instead, the controller test case should be created within a subfolder that mirrors the project structure, i.e. in tests/modules//controllers

Could not reproduce the issue against the SVN trunk. Here is what I did:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    [adam@zfdev zf]$ zf create project ZF-11423
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11423]$ zf create module admin
    Creating the following module and artifacts:
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/controllers
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/models
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/views
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/views/scripts
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/views/helpers
    /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/views/filters
    Added a key for path module directory to the application.ini file
    Updating project profile '/tmp/zf/ZF-11423/.zfproject.xml'
    
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11423]$ zf create controller Home
    Creating a controller at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/controllers/HomeController.php
    Creating an index action method in controller Home
    Creating a view script for the index action method at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/views/scripts/home/index.phtml
    Creating a controller test file at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/tests/application/controllers/HomeControllerTest.php
    Updating project profile '/tmp/zf/ZF-11423/.zfproject.xml'
    
    [adam@zfdev ZF-11423]$ zf create controller Home index-action-included=1 admin
    Creating a controller at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/controllers/HomeController.php
    Creating an index action method in controller Home
    Creating a view script for the index action method at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/application/modules/admin/views/scripts/home/index.phtml
    Creating a controller test file at /tmp/zf/ZF-11423/tests/application/modules/admin/controllers/HomeControllerTest.php
    Updating project profile '/tmp/zf/ZF-11423/.zfproject.xml'
    
    [adam@zfdev  ZF-11423]$ find . -name "*Test.php"
    ./tests/application/controllers/IndexControllerTest.php
    ./tests/application/controllers/HomeControllerTest.php
    ./tests/application/modules/admin/controllers/HomeControllerTest.php


As you can see, both controller tests are created in their proper locations.

Could you provide a similar transcript from your system which shows the controller test file ending up in the wrong location?
