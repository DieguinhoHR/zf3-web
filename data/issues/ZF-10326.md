### Description

It would be nice to have a simple way to have all the SQL query strings that have been executed, in a logfile which you could specify. Additionally, be able to activate in an easy way the profiler for each SQL query. So each log would include the SQL query string and possibly the profiling of that query.

I'd be interested in working on this feature.

It would likely be Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Log and use Zend\_Log for the writing. This way, it could be used for outputting via any number of log writers. Interestingly, this method could likely invalidate the need for Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug since Zend\_Log already has a firebug writer.

Perhaps this should have a proposal written up for it.
