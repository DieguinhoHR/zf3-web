ZF-157: why sending CRLF?
-------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2006-06-29T03:25:57.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:44:29.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 0.1.4 (29/Jun/06)

### Description

In Zend\_Http\_Client incubator version, the \_write() method is written,

 
        fwrite($socket, $request . "\r\n");


But, is CRLF needed here?

$request set $headers + "\\r\\n" + $body in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Abstract::request() method, so I think it will be

 
        fwrite($socket, $request);


Please check it.
