ZF-5536: Zend\_Mail utf-8 header tests should be changed to hexform
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Unit Tests: Improvement Created: 2009-01-13T09:36:42.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T21:37:31.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

All tests in Zend\_Mail that use UTF-8 chars should be converted to take hex sequences of UTF-8 chars (example Ã¤ = \\xC3\\xA4), such that they don't break in editors/systems that don't support UTF-8 by default.

This makes the suite more stable.

Benjamin, is this one still open, or can we close it?
