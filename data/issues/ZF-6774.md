ZF-6774: Unable to invoke methods through AMF from Java

### Description

Summary: , I'm sending a Java Primitive Array(String[]) in Java and it is going as Array Reference and this is not being deserialized correctly by the Zend PHP framework, however it works fine when I call this from a Flex Project, where an Array is sent and not Array Reference. (Attached are the images which show the AMF request being sent)

Description:

I have a php class which has a method as shown below.

public function testarray($arr) { return $arr; }

I'm invoking this method using the AMFConnection class available as part of BlazeDS (flex.messaging.io.amf.client.AMFConnection), through the following code.

AMFConnection amfConnection = new AMFConnection(); amfConnection.setObjectEncoding(3); amfConnection.setInstantiateTypes(false);

Object[] args = new Object[1]; args[0] = new String[]{"a","b"}; amfConnection.connect("http://localhost/phpproject/gateway.php");

RemotingMessage message = new RemotingMessage(); message.setMessageId(flex.messaging.util.UUIDUtils.createUUID()); message.setOperation("testArray"); message.setBody(args); message.setSource("testPhp"); message.setDestination("GenericDestination");

returnValue = amfConnection.call(null, message);

The return value from the server is the argument that is passed, i.e. I should get the array with strings a,b, but I'm getting 0 as the arguments were not passed correctly
