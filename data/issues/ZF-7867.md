### Description

Zend\_Json\_Decoder::decode($source = null, $objectDecodeType = Zend\_Json::TYPE\_ARRAY) shoud return null when $source === null instead of returing Exception. So returns json\_decode() function in php.

I think this is fine and not any issue. It's throwing an exceptions because there is nothing to encode. This is a PHP null.

Thoughts?

I agree. Changing the behavior at this point in ZFv1's lifecycle would likely be counterproductive. I do, however, think it's prudent that we discuss whether ZFv2's Zend\\Json should incorporate this change. Should it align with json\_decode's behavior for consistency, or does throwing an exception make more sense?
