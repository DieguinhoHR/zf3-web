ZF-194: PHP notice in Zend/Pdf/Element/Reference.php

### Description

I get the following PHP notice since I upgraded ZF from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4: {quote} _Notice:_ Only variable references should be returned by reference in _C:\\projects\\vendors\\Zend\\Pdf\\Element\\Reference.php_ on line _207_{quote}

The notice goes away when I change line 207 from this: {quote} public function &\_\_get($property){quote} to this: {quote} public function \_\_get($property){quote}

This will keep the PDF from rendering in the browser due to headers already being sent.

Having your error\_reporting level kept low would also keep this from appearing.

Duplicate of ZF-160. This is fixed in the 0.1.5 release.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
