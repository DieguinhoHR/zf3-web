ZF-2550: Refactor Zend\_Filter\_Input to use Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2008-02-02T22:09:55.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-03-21T16:25:30.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.5.0 (17/Mar/08)

### Description

After a recent update to Zend\_Loader, Zend\_Filter\_Input began emitting warning errors for non-existent classes. This is because Zend\_Filter\_Input was using a base 'namespace' property to derive the base name for both filters and validators and would try both before matching the correct class name.

This needs to be refactored to allow Zend\_Loader\_PluginLoader to locate the correct class name more efficiently and to also refine the API for Zend\_Filter\_Input to allow better distinction between filter and validator namespaces.

Fix for next minor release (1.5.0 RC1)

The removal of the following protected members could affect extending classes:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_namespaces = array('Zend_Filter', 'Zend_Validate');
    protected $_userNamespaces = array();


The behavioral changes in \_getFilterOrValidator() may also pose backward-compatibility problems, but I'm unsure how many people might be extending it and using the method.

Simon, will you have time to get to this in the next couple of days? This is on the very short :) list of 1.5 unresolved must-haves. We'll have to resolve it very soon!

Thanks. ,Wil
