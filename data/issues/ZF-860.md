### Description

Recently the incubator docs have been modified to work with xincludes. I assume that the same will happen for the trunk documentation.

The DocBook to Wiki script should be modified to work with these xincludes, in order to keep working.

Script has been modified, and will be applied from as soon as the xinclude changes are made to the live docs.

The task is mine to modify the core docs to use the xinclude syntax. I'm working on that soon.
