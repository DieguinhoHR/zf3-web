### Description

With Zend\_Cache, serialization is usually performed by the cache-frontend. It would be nice to allow cache back-ends to perform serialization & de-serialization in some cases.

A case in point would be if there were a back-end for redis. The module phpredis[1] is able to perform different types of serialization, including using igbinary[2]. These are fast, native serializations, implemented in c.

The back-end could advertise its ability to perform serializations via the getCapabilities() method, for example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      public function getCapabilities()
      {
          return array(
              'serialization'      => true
              /* ... other capabilities ... */
          );
      }


In which case, the front-end need not check that the input data is a string when the 'automatic\_serialization' option is used, (referring to Zend\_Cache\_Core::save()).
