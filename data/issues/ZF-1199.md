### Description

Windows XP PHP 5.2.1

I get the following error message :

    <pre class="highlight">
    ....
    $mail = new Zend_Mail(); 
    $tr = new Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp($smtp_server); 
    Zend_Mail::setDefaultTransport($tr); 
    $mail->setMimeBoundary('=_' . md5(microtime(1)) .$mailbox_name);
    $tr->connect();
    ....

Hi Viktor

The example you show doesn't need to have the 'connect()' method - the transport class takes care of opening/closing the connection internally and does not need to be set by the developer. Remove that line and you'll be able to send mail as expected.

Hi Simon

This is described about in reference guide 20.3 Sending Multiple Mails and should be corrected.
