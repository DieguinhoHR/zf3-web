### Description

I found out that this getLine()-function always return line number 234 even if a error is occurred in another line. I use PHP version "5.2.6-3 ubuntu 4.4".

 
    <pre class="literal">
    
    try {
    
    //any critical code
    
    }
    
    catch(Zend_Exception $exception) {
    
    $exception->getLine();
    
    
    }

I've tried a number of combinations, and in every case, getLine() reports correctly.
