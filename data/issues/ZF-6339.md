Mickael, please revert the change.

When constants are used in configuration files, they create an implied concatenation. The original as correct.

In example 4.2, earlier on in the same page it uses a period after the constant. I was baseing my issue upone that. I think one of them must be wrong here?

resources.frontController.controllerDirectory = APPLICATION\_PATH . "/controllers"
