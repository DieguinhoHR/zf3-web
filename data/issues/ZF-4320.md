I've got the same problem here. If I want to merge some PDF files like:

$pdf = new Zend\_Pdf(); ... $template = new Zend\_Pdf("template.pdf", null, true); $pdf->pages[0] = new Zend\_Pdf\_Page($template->pages[0]);

$pdfPage = new Zend\_Pdf\_Page(); $pdf->pages[1] = $pdfPage;

is there any plan to implement this?

From the source code that throws that exception:

 
    <pre class="highlight">            /**
                 * @todo Page cloning must be implemented here instead of exception.
                 *       PDF objects (ex. fonts) can be shared between pages.
                 *       Thus all referenced objects, which can be modified, must be cloned recursively,
                 *       to avoid producing wrong object references in a context of source PDF.
                 */

I look into it if it can be implemented.

On first sight, this cannot be implemented in a fast way.

We are generating several reports from our database automaticaly with Zend PDF, but are not able to merge different reports into one PDF document or to move pages between documents. Would it be possible that one of the developers of Zend PDF could solve this? We would be gladly willing to give a donation to support zend framework in order to get this issue solved.
