### Description

Not sure why but I dont seem to be able to post this as a ZF2 issue.

Line 146 of Zend\\Http\\Header\\SetCookie.php processes dates within cookies assuming an abbreviated day name as follows:

$multipleHeaders = preg\_split('#(?<!Sun|Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat),\\s\*#', $value);.

We are using ZF2 to retrieve and process data from a web service, and whilst the Date field in the cookie returned with our data is formatted properly, the Date Expires field is formatted with a long day name (i.e. Monday instead of Mon).

When processing the cookie the preg\_split line above doesnt process the date expires correctly, and results in the script totally failing.

This can be fixed by replacing the above line of codde as follows:

$multipleHeaders = preg\_split('#(?<!Sun|Sunday|Mon|Monday|Tue|Tuesday|Wed|Wednesday|Thu|Thursday|Fri|Friday|Sat|Saturday),\\s\*#', $value);

However, I'm not sure if that breaks something else.
