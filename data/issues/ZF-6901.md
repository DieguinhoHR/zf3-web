ZF-6901: Zend\_Db\_Table does not utilise its own getter methods

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract has a getter method for $this->\_rowClass. However, it does not use it in it's own functions - it references $this->\_rowClass directly. This obviates their purpose, as far as I can see.

This means that developers cannot write custom logic to set $this->\_rowClass. For instance, in my use-case, I have a digitalAssets table which contains filesystem references to images, MP3s, etc. It would be helpful if I could override $this->getRowClass() to return different row classes for each of these types - imageAsset, mp3Asset, etc.

Any examples on this?

I have same kind of situation and I have overridden Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset\_Abstract::current() and Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::fecthRow.

And I decide on type field in database, which rowClass should be used, image, file or video rowclass.
