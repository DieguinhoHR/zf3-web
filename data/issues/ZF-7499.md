### Description

I upgraded to 1.9 and found out that my site wasn't working properly. I found out this is because a Regex on one of my domains connected to the ZF system is also in effect on the other domain.

Trying to access /controller/action/param/teststring on domain2 works. But when I try to access /controller/action/param/123 (note that this is a number matching the regex) on domain2 then the regex rule in the code (for domain1) goes in to effect and the routing works unexpectedly.

I guess the chain() function applies the regex to all domains not just the specified domain as before.

My rewrite configuration looks like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $router = $frontController->getRouter ();
    
    $domain1= new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname(
        ':subdomain.:domain.:tld',
        array(
            'module' => 'domain',
        ),
        array(
            'domain' => '([a-z0-9]+)',
        )
    );
    $router->addRoute('Pagination', $domain1->chain(new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Regex ( '(.+)/(\d+)', 
        array ('controller' => 'page', 'action' => 'index'),array(1=> 'permalink', 2 => 'page')
    )));
    
    $domain2 = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname(
        'static.:domaindomain.:tldtld',
        array(
            'module' => 'admin',
        )
    );
    $router->addRoute('Admin', $domain2->chain(new Zend_Controller_Router_Route(
        ':controller/:action/*', array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index')
    )));
