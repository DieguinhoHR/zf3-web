### Description

To simulate the schema system in RDBMS which don't support it (as MySQL, where SCHEMA is a DATABASE) I thought to patch the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract by adding a protected attribute called Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::$\_schemaSeparator (default to '.') and a public method Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::getSchemaSeparator()

Then by simply changing the '.' string with a call to Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::getSchemaSeparator() in the following methods: Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_setupMetadata() Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_setupTableName() Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::\_setupPrimaryKey() Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::insert() Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::update Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract::delete() Zend\_Db\_Select::\_\_toString() Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join()

So you could extend an Adapter (eg MySQLi) by definig the attribute $\_schemaSeparator (say with '\_\_') and you get a sort of schema management analogue of PostgreSQL one (for example), to group table in namespaces.

I've also build a patch you could find in [http://dev.tesio.it/patch.Zend\_Db](http://dev.tesio.it/patch.Zend_Db)

The work estimate contain simply adding the patch to the core CVS and testing more widely...

Please categorize/fix as needed.

I realized that, when using such a feature, you should set Adapter::$\_autoQuoteIdentifiers = FALSE: otherwise, a "virtual schema" called "schema" and a table named "test\_table" with an Adapter::$\_schemaSeparator = '\_\_' you would get a query quoting the table as `schema`\_\_`test_table` which is clearly wrong.

To make it work better I'm wondering of a protected \_schemaSperatator setter (say Adapter::\_setSchemaSeparator(string $separator, boolean $explodeIdentifiers = false) )

$explodeIdentifiers set a protected Adapter boolean attribute (defined true by default in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract) which enable / disable the explode() call in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_quoteIdentifierAs()

What do you think about this?

Here an updated Patch which fix a little bug in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_joinUsing() and follow the contributer guide (aka, built using svn diff)

No action on this issue for too long. I'm reassigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.
