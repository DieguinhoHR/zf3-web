With revision 4874, there are some more tests for Zend\_Db\_Statement and its subclasses.

- Zend\_Db\_Statement: 66.67% coverage
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Db2: 61.17% coverage
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli: 97.70% coverage
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle: 71.07% coverage

PDO adapters do not exercise the Zend\_Db\_Statement classes.

As of revision 5256, here are the testing coverage stats:

- Zend\_Db\_Statement: 81.15% coverage
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Db2: 65.45%
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Mysqli: 92.23%
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Oracle: 66.04%
- Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Pdo: 89.39%

Overall coverage: 76%.

This is a significant enough improvement over the code coverage when this issue was raised.
