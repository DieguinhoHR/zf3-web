ZF-9734: Rewrite Router Makes Named Routes Sticky

### Description

If I create a named route, and pass its name to Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Rewrite's assemble(), all subsequent calls to assemble (such as via the url view helper, or any of Zend\_Navigation's view helpers) will continue to use the named route; making it akin to being 'sticky'.

This means that ANY URL generation without a named route needs to be explicit about using the 'default' route, which is entirely unexpected; I would expect the default route to be used when a name is not specified.

The first block of logic in assemble dealing with the name parameter certainly looks intentional:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($name == null) {
                try {
                    $name = $this->getCurrentRouteName();
                } catch (Zend_Controller_Router_Exception $e) {
                    $name = 'default';
                }
            }


However, I cannot figure out how that logic is at all useful.

Subclassing Z\_C\_R\_Rewrite to solve this is fairly straightforward, but I believe it would be an improvement if assemble() behaved like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($name == null) {
                $name = 'default';
            }


Or perhaps a more compatible change:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if ($name == null) {
                try {
                    $name = $this->getCurrentRouteName();
                } catch (Zend_Controller_Router_Exception $e) {
                    $name = 'default';
                }
                if ($reset) {
                    $name = 'default';
                }
            }

Your expectations are wrong, unfortunately. The url() helpers use whatever route was matched in the current request by default -- this is to simplify generating links that return to the same route. (In many cases, you can simply call $this->url() or $this->url($someParams) and it will "just work").

As a rule of thumb, you should always pass the route name to the helper to ensure the appropriate route is used to assemble the URL.

I think this behaviour is surprising and can have some unexpected side-effects. For example, if I use Zend\_Nav to compose menus, the hrefs will change based on which route matched for the current request (unless the route is explicitly specified for each menu item).

I can see that the router is behaving as designed, but I do question the assertion that this simplifies link generation. Perhaps the router should offer an option to disable this behaviour and always use the default route when no route is given to assemble().
