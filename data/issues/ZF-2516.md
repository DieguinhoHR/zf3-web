ZF-2516: Fix Zend\_Controller\_Request docs to remove references to $\_COOKIE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The Zend\_Controller\_Request docs read: {quote} getParam() retrieves more than user params In order to do some of its work, getParam() actually retrieves from several sources. In order of priority, these include: user parameters set via setParam(), GET parameters, POST parameters, and finally COOKIE parameters. Be aware of this when pulling data via this method. {quote}

Internally, Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Http does not refer to the $\_COOKIE array ever. Docs should be updated to reflect this.

Bookkeeping. Closing and assigning all old unassigned issues. The only unassigned issues should be new and unreviewed.
