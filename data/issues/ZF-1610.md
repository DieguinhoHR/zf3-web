### Description

Zend\_Session::rememberMe() allows setting a cookie lifetime. However, internally it calls Zend\_Session::rememberUntil(), which in turn calls session\_set\_cookie\_params(). This will have no effect if the session has already been started. From the session\_set\_cookie\_params() documentation in the PHP manual, "you need to call session\_set\_cookie\_params() for every request and before session\_start() is called."

Zend\_Session::rememberMe() should therefore likely not allow the $seconds argument, and it should be documented that to set a lifetime for a session, it should be done prior to calling Zend\_Session::start().

Updated documentation to reflect these conditions; resolved with [SVN r5500](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=5500).
