### Description

This is related to <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10447>

But I hope this may help.

Using the standard serialization of the adapter I noticed two things ( other than the DB reconnect ): - 1) Zend\_Paginator::\_getCacheInternalId() is called three times ( in my usage ), the first md5 serialization differs from the other two, probably because the last two modify the \_select of the adapter. 2) The md5 changes on every subsequent page load, why I don't know at this stage.

I tried moving away from the serialization of the object to a string representation of the \_select of the adapter ( added a getSelect() method ) this had the same effect as 1) but the subsequent loads did provide the same hashed strings, which was an improvement.

I then added a static cache within the Zend\_Paginator::\_getCacheInternalId() method which stored the initial hash ( probably the one before the paging changed the select ) and this seems to work.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _getCacheInternalId()
        {
            static $cache = array();
            $adapter_namespace = get_class( $this->getAdapter() );
            if ( !array_key_exists( $adapter_namespace, $cache ) ) {
                $cache[$adapter_namespace] = md5(serialize(array(
                                                 $adapter_namespace,
                                                 (string)$this->getAdapter()->getSelect(),
                                                 $this->getItemCountPerPage()
                                              )));
            }
                  
            return $cache[$adapter_namespace];
        }


The page number is still added to the md5 so it should still be unique.

Whether this is a valid solution I really don't know at this stage but thought it worth mentioning. [edit]Code modified to allow caches for different adapter namespaces[/edit]
