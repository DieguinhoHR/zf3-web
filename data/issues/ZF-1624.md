### Description

Stopword analyzer removes words from a query. Result set for empty query is empty set. Default boolean operator is "AND". So it gives "empty query" as a result.

I made several checks and tests.

To get complete solution issue should be resolved with an additional "full set" query type, but it affects large enough set of classes, so it should be postponed to post-1.0 period.

Hi,

We are implementing a stop word list and we have noticed an odd bit of behaviour when doing searches and the order of stop words in the query.

Currenlty these are the stop words:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $stopWords = array('the', 'and', 'a', 'to', 'of', 'in', 
                       'i', 'is', 'that', 'it', 'on', 'you', 
                       'this', 'for', 'but', 'with', 'are', 
                       'have', 'be', 'at', 'or', 'as', 'was', 
                       'so', 'if', 'out', 'not');


If we do a query like: "it is this" it returns no results.

If we do a query like: "this is it" we get results.

I am just wondering if this is proper behaviour for the stop words and searching?

TIA,

Andrew
