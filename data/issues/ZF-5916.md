ZF-5916: missing explicit null for error in response
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-03-01T15:10:09.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-10-16T23:32:21.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

JSON-RPC specs say that there should be an explicit null for error key:

 { "result": "Hello JSON-RPC", "error": null, "id": 1}

However the error key is not set in ZF response:

 { "result": "Hello JSON-RPC", "id": 1}

This has the effect of throwing exceptions on many client libraries, including the python package from json-rpc.org. Result key should be set as null as well when response has errors.

Suggested modification:

 
    public function toJson()
    {
        if ($this->isError()) {
            $response = array(
                'result' => null,
                'error' => $this->getError()->toArray(),
                'id'    => $this->getId(),
            );
        } else {
            $response = array(
                'result' => $this->getResult(),
                'id'     => $this->getId(),
                'error' => null
            );
        }
    
        if (null !== ($version = $this->getVersion())) {
            $response['jsonrpc'] = $version;
        }
    
        require_once 'Zend/Json.php';
        return Zend_Json::encode($response);
    }

I've added the correction as an attached file to this issue. So far I had no problem with it.

added explicit null for error on success. also added explicity null for result on error.
