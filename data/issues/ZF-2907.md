### Description

When we use Zend\_Config to configure Zend\_Form object, we can't set elements values. The config file like this do not work in latest ZF version (it worked fine in ZF1.5PR):

 
    <pre class="literal">(...)
    elements.submit.type = "submit"
    elements.submit.options.value = "Login"
    elements.submit.options.class = "submit"
    (...)

Indeed, this was a change made after PR. The value of the submit element should now be set through the label. So the following works:

(...) elements.submit.options.label = "Login" (...)

I tried to find you a reference from the documentation but I didn't find, I could have missed it. But I'm marking this issue as docs instead of major bug and changing the title accordingly.
