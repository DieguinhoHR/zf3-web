ZF-9965: Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 incorrectly signs urls with spaces in them

### Description

Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_S3 line 580 adds the path, but if the path contains spaces they are not correctly encoded as %20.

My current workaround is as follows

// replace spaces with %20, Zend bug $headers=array('date'=>$timestamp); $str=$this->addSignature('GET', str\_replace(' ', '%20', $bucket\_alias."/".$file\_name), $headers);

I would also recommend separating the signature string formation and actual signing functions.

The $object passed to \_makeRequest() is expected to already have spaces (and certain other characters) urlencoded. The \_fixupObjectName() method does this. Public methods that operate on objects call $this->\_fixupObjectName($object) prior to \_makeRequest(). Marking as not an issue.

Although the code you referenced is actually within \_makeRequest(), I see your point regarding the public addSignature() method requiring a urlencoded path, while the other public methods which operate on objects do not. Reopening and will submit a proposed patch in a moment. The best approach without breaking existing behavior may be to expose \_fixupObjectName as a public method and note in the phpdoc for addSignature that the path parameter must be encoded.

Since public method addSignature() needs the path to be specially urlencoded, and protected method \_fixupObjectName() already does this internally, this patch changes \_fixupObjectName() to be a public method fixupObjectName().

Deprecates but retains the original protected function as a proxy for BC. Also adds comment to addSignature() to be clear that usage of addSignature requires running the object path through fixupObjectName() first.

Also includes a unit test.

I think that this problem was fixed by [~Padraic] in ZF-10197 with ZF-1.11. Try

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = array(
       'rfc3986_strict' => true
    );
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client(null, $config);
    Zend_Service_Amazon_S3::setClient($client);
