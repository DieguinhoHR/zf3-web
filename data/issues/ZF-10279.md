ZF-10279: in zend\_file\_transfer\_adapter\_http possible bug in Workaround for a PHP error returning empty $\_FILES when form data exceeds php settings

### Description

If one has a form with a file upload element which is set to not required. The $\_FILES will be empty on POST. However $content( = $\_SERVER['CONTENT\_LENGTH']) will be larger than 0. The 'workaround' is activated and there will be an error station that the file has exceeded the ini size.

As I understand it this workaround is in place to detect file uploads larger than the php.ini's max\_post\_size, php will give in that situation an empty $\_FILES.

If this is the reason I would suggest the following change: if (empty($this->\_files) && ($content > ini\_get('post\_max\_size')))

But maybe I'm overlooking something....

The code: // Workaround for a PHP error returning empty $\_FILES when form data exceeds php settings

> if (empty($this->_files) && ($content > 0)) {
>             if (is_array($files)) {
>                 $files = current($files);
>             }
>     
>             $temp = array($files => array(
>                 'name'  => $files,
>                 'error' => 1));
>             $validator = $this->_validators['Zend_Validate_File_Upload'];
>             $validator->setFiles($temp)
>                       ->isValid($files, null);
>             $this->_messages += $validator->getMessages();
>             return false;
>         }

I can not verify this behaviour in my examples. Can you give an code example which shows your problem?

Using a file element which is not set to required does not raise an failure within the tests as mentioned by the reporter of this issue

As there is additionally no response this issue is closed as non-issue

I'm sorry that I was too slow to reply. The problem is that my code is not easily to paste here. So I decided yesterday to further investigate the problem, Before getting back to you.

I use jquery.form to submit. I discovered yesterday that if one has an empty upload field, jquery form will not post the form as multipart/form-data, but as application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If the upload field is not empty it will post as multipart/form-data. The strange thing is that zend does not throw an exception stating that a multipart post was expected, but throws the error 'File ... has exceeded defined ini size'. Maybe zend cannot detect this?!

The sollution is to set jquery.form to use an iframe. I think other people will run in to this, so hopefully this issue is still usefull to others.

My apology's for waisting your time. Thanks for the help.
