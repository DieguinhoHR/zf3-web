### Description

See [<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-4226>]

There is a error when check the domain of a cookie, I finally found that exists an error in the comparision way.

Valid domain are:

.zend.com => must catch zend.com and anything.zend.com .<www.zend.com> => must catch <www.zend.com> and anything.<www.zend.com>, this's not works right now.

Invalid domain are:

.com.ar .or com. or .com => the script doesn't check this. zend.com without initial dot.

This is the code that fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _matchDomain($domain) {
            $ret = array();
    
            foreach (array_keys($this->cookies) as $cdom) {
                          $regex = "/" . preg_quote($cdom, "/") . "$/i";
                  if (preg_match($regex, $domain)) $ret[$cdom] = &$this->cookies[$cdom];
            }
            return $ret;
        }


Here a faster but not ideal, solution:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _matchDomain($domain) {
            $ret = array();
    
            foreach (array_keys($this->cookies) as $cdom) {
                          $regex = '/\.' . preg_quote($domain, '/') . '$/i';
                  if (preg_match($regex, $cdom)) $ret[$cdom] = &$this->cookies[$cdom];
            }
            return $ret;
        }


This only fix the valid domain issue.

Regards.

This is somewhat improved after fixing ZF-5221 in rev. 17079 - but we still can't filter out .com or .co.ar domains - that would require quite a lot of work. I am also not sure it's the work of the cookie jar to filter those - maybe if Zend\_Http\_Client.
