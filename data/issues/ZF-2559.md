### Description

I tried to send letter using charset 'cp1251' or 'win1251'. For this purpose I created new instance of Zend\_Mail passed this charset in constructor. Then called functions setSubject and setBodyHtml pointed my message.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $mail = new Zend_Mail('cp1251');
    $mail->setSubject('Поздравляем с успешной регистрацией');
    $mail->setBodyHtml("<b>Blah-blah</b>");


Receved message has problem with subject. The subject has useless symbol. GMail: 'Поздравляем с успешной рег_истрацией' ('_' means space) Yandex: 'Поздравляем с успешной рег=_истрацией' ('_' means space) Mail.ru: 'Поздравляем с успешной регE8истрацией'

I think that problem happened around cyrillic symbols.

Thank you!

    protected function _encodeHeader($value)
    {
      if (Zend_Mime::isPrintable($value)) {
          return $value;
      } else {
          return '=?' . $this->_charset . '?B?' . Zend_Mime::encodeBase64($value) . '?=';
      }


This should fix your problem, the problem is Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable looks buggy so I used a B encode (base64) on the subject . This was the quick fix for me, I'll try to put togheter a patch and fix Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable.

Was this fixed in the repository? If not, this should probably be marked 'won't fix'.

Please verify resolved status.

I attached the 'quick fix' patch, please commit

Another issue should probably be opened for Zend\_Mime::encodeQuotedPrintable, more testing with utf-8?

Solved in SVN r13496.

1) Change \_encodeHeader() can encode by not only quotedPrintable but also by Base64.

2) Add $\_encodingOfHeaders and setter/getter functions.

I changed the name to $\_headerEncoding
