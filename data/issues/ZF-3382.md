### Description

When using Zend\_Cache and the site is under heavy load it does not use cache anymore. We have tested using ab benchmark software and it seems that Zend\_Cache cannot read each time the metadata file which generates a new cache instance so the cache is regenerated

Seems to be a file locking problem , have you tried such a test with a memory based backend ? (APC, Memcached ...)

 

 

Posted by caval ionut (daniel123) on 2008-06-04T08:41:45.000+0000

No we haven't tried that. Unfortunately we cannot use a memory based cached. Are there any other solutions that we might try? Thank you

following code works under heavy load with apache bench :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Cache.php';
    
    $frontendOptions = array(
       'lifetime' => 7200
    );
    
    $backendOptions = array(
        'cache_dir' => '/tmp/' // Directory where to put the cache files
    );
    
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    
    if(!$result = $cache->load('myresult')) {
        $result='foobar foobar foobar...';
        $cache->save($result, 'myresult');
        echo "NOT CACHED";
    } else {
        echo "CACHED";
    }
    


I tried with "ab -c 50 -n 1000" (50 concurrent request)

I got : "Failed requests: 0"

If you try the same example with a lifetime of 2 seconds for example (to get a NOT CACHED during the test), you have some "Failed requests because of length which is not the same "CACHED" or "NOT CACHED").

So IMHO, File backend works under heavy load.

Have try to activate logging ? If it's a file locking problem (because of specific software or hardware...), you can try to desactivate file locking in backend options ?

Can you try my example on your servers ?

Hi, Sorry for the late response but i was working on other solution of cache. I have tried your solution and the problem persists. <_> I got that too but during that test the cached file was rewritten once/second. Please try you test with more content on the page. I have tested using the the index page of my site which has most resource consuming modules. So the problem is not that i don't get the response back from server, the problem is that sometime the script cannot read the file and therefore it will generate another cache file. Thank you, hope that helps_

no problem for me

please activate logging

I attach the code that i have used too:

$logger = new Zend\_Log(); $writer = new Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Stream(ROOT\_DIR . '/cache/log.txt');

$logger->addWriter($writer);

$logger->log('>>>>START ' . $session\_id, 1);

$frontendOptions = array( 'lifetime' => 600000, 'logging' => true );

$backendOptions = array( 'cache\_dir' => ROOT\_DIR . '/cache/', // Directory where to put the cache files 'file\_locking' => false );

$cache = Zend\_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);

if(!$result = $cache->load('myresult')) { for ($i=0;$i<100000;$i++) { $result .= $i . '  
'; } //$result='foobar foobar foobar...'; $cache->save($result, 'myresult'); $logger->log('NOT CACHED', 1); echo "NOT CACHED"; $logger->log('<<<<END ' . $session\_id, 1); } else { $logger->log('CACHED', 1); echo "CACHED"; $logger->log('<<<<END ' . $session\_id, 1); }

Using the code above I was still getting the following results in ab:

I'm definitely seeing the same thing here.

Not entirely sure whats happening, but the file backend is removing metadata and cache files before they expire under high load.

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:28:39.000+0000

I can reliably reproduce this using the testcase code using ab and -n 1000 -c 4 (instead of -c 50).

PHP 5.2.6 running as FastCGI

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:30:04.000+0000

Also... using APC 3.0.19

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:35:24.000+0000

Still happens with file\_locking turned off.

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:45:43.000+0000

Here is a better log, with the actual Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File logging output

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:48:38.000+0000

Here is another log, this time with file\_locking turned on

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T15:55:18.000+0000

The problem still happens with file locking on and both read and write control turned off.

Not sure whats going on here but it basically makes the File Backend completely useless under any kind of load.

pretty standard linux setup, 2.6.18 on an ext3 fs.

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T16:06:34.000+0000

OK, I've found the problem and a fix.

I will post a patch after I've had a chance to verify it and clean it up.

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-25T17:45:10.000+0000

I've attached a patch to fix this issue. apply with patch -p0

Basically there were some implementation details of the reading and writing of files here that were very vulnerable to race conditions.

I have tested this on linux 2.6 and windows, it performs perfectly in both cases.

here is a summary of the changes in the patch:

- removed filesize check and fread from \_fileGetContents and replaced with stream\_get\_contents, lessens race vulnerability
- removed flock(LOCK\_UN) calls from \_fileGetContents/\_filePutContents, since fclose releases locks anyway, and they create a tiny and needless race condition between lock release and fclose.
- added third optional parameter to \_setMetadatas, to disable writing metadata to disk, eliminating the needless rewriting of metadatas file during \_getMetadatas
- changed fopen mode in \_filePutContents to ab+ from wb, and added fseek(0) and ftruncate(0) calls after LOCK\_EX, This virtually eliminates the race problems due to PHP fopen implementation. see <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=28371> and <http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/article/107> for reasons why this is better
 


 

Posted by caval ionut (daniel123) on 2008-06-26T00:20:11.000+0000

That seems to fix it. I have added the patch to Zend library.

Thanks a lot

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-26T05:18:13.000+0000

I will get a contributor license agreement sent to Zend today so that the patch can be applied for 1.5.3

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-26T06:33:18.000+0000

Also, just a quick note, the likely reason Fabian didn't see the problem with his testcase, is the amount of data being cached in his testcase is small enough that it fits in the normal fwrite/fread buffers and thus minimizes the race condition a bit, using Caval's test case will hit the problem every time.

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-26T09:47:25.000+0000

Also this patch improves performance greatly in the case of a php backend that does not have a particular cache id in its internal metadatas array, as it no longer rewrites the metadatas file to disk in this case.

 

 

Posted by Fabien MARTY (fab) on 2008-06-26T10:41:59.000+0000

Can't reproduce this even with a 10 MB cache file !

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'Zend/Cache.php';
    
    $frontendOptions = array(
       'lifetime' => 7200
    );
    
    $backendOptions = array(
        'cache_dir' => '/tmp/' // Directory where to put the cache files
    );
    
    $cache = Zend_Cache::factory('Core', 'File', $frontendOptions, $backendOptions);
    
    if(!$result = $cache->load('myresult')) {
        $res = '';
        for ($i = 0 ; $i < 1000000 ; $i++) {
            $res .= '0123456789';
        }
        $cache->save($res, 'myresult');
        echo "NOT CACHED";
    } else {
        echo "CACHED";
    }
    
    ?>
    
    ab -c 50 -n 1000 URL
    
    => no failed request (a "not cached" would produce a length error)
    


 

 

Posted by Fabien MARTY (fab) on 2008-06-26T10:50:10.000+0000

some interesting things in the patch anyway

I'm reviewing it

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-26T11:01:36.000+0000

The ab failed request is not what shows you the bug :-)

activate a logger for the cache and log cached vs not cached in a log file.

What is happening is under load, without my patch, you will get constant cache misses as the metadatas and cache files are trampled due to race conditions. see the log files I have attached to the bug.

The part of the patch "added third optional parameter to \_setMetadatas, to disable writing metadata to disk, eliminating the needless rewriting of metadatas file during \_getMetadatas" is commited into the trunk and into the 1.5 branch

Other parts should be commited only into the trunk (for 1.6 release)

Could you try the head of the 1.5 branch to see if the problem is fixed for you ?

 

 

Posted by Fabien MARTY (fab) on 2008-06-26T14:11:43.000+0000

other part of the patch commited to the trunk (for 1.6 release)

good job

thanks

 

 

Posted by Cody Pisto (cpisto) on 2008-06-26T14:27:44.000+0000

Tested 1.5 branch snapshot, definitely helps reduce the problem quite a bit, but does not totally eliminate it as the full patch does.

Thanks a ton for your work, and I really look forward to the next 1.5 release and more so to 1.6!!

 

 

Posted by Wil Sinclair (wil) on 2008-09-02T10:39:33.000+0000

Updating for the 1.6.0 release.
