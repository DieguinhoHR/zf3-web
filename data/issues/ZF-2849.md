### Description

Following ZF-2843, it's clear that Zend\_Config\_Ini could be refactored to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain.

First attempt at a clean up. This improves the comments and adds new functions: \_loadIniFile(), \_loadAllSections() and \_loadSection(). Most significantly \_\_construct() is much reduced and so hopefully easier to understand.

This is the full Ini.php file for the first attempt at refactoring Zend\_Config\_Ini. It may be easier to see the improvements, by looking at the result.
