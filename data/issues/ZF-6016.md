ZF-6016: Zend\_\* ignoring my Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload()

### Description

In the Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row\_Abstract->findParentRow method it tries to include the $parentClass by directly calling Zend\_Loader::loadClass($parentTable). I would expect it to use My\_Loader as I set it with Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload('My\_Loader'). If we're adding stuff to the \_\_autoload stack, we should be using it.

I would propose wrapping it in a if(!class\_exists($parentClass,true)) which will autoload it based on the \_\_autoload stack as expected.

Im Zend\_Loader::loadClass() is being called all over the place without first checking the \_\_autoload stack.
