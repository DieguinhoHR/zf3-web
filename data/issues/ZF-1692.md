### Description

since I need to use the MySQL specific STRAIGHT\_JOIN Syntax to optimize the run time for some queries, I had to extend Zend\_Db\_Select.

I created a Travello\_Db\_Select\_Mysql class which extends the Zend\_Db\_Select class. Then I added a new constant STRAIGHT\_JOIN and a new method joinStraight(). Until now everything is fine, but now I got two problems with the Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join() method of Zend\_Db\_Select.

1. The first row of the Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join() method looks like this:
 

    <pre class="highlight">
       $joinTypes = array(self::INNER_JOIN, self::LEFT_JOIN,
                          self::RIGHT_JOIN, self::FULL_JOIN,
                          self::CROSS_JOIN, self::NATURAL_JOIN);


To add my self::STRAIGHT\_JOIN constant I need to copy the whole Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join() method and the only thing I need to change is this first row.

1. Since the method Zend\_Db\_Select::\_uniqueCorrelation() is defined as private I get a fatal error. So I had to change Zend\_Db\_Select::\_uniqueCorrelation() from private to protected.

Is there a chance that Zend\_Db\_Select could be changed a little to avoid these problems when extending Zend\_Db\_Select, i.e.

1. Create an extensible method which creates the $joinTypes Array in the Zend\_Db\_Select::\_join() method
2. Change Zend\_Db\_Select::\_uniqueCorrelation() from private to protected
