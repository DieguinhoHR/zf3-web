ZF-2809: Value of from() table does not have precedence on JOIN
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-03-05T11:31:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-07-31T20:28:35.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

When running a JOIN query, the table being referenced from loses its values to the JOINing table, for example joining table1 and table2 on columnA, columnA in the result set's value will be the value of what is in table2. If there is no corresponding record in table2, then it will be NULL, so you lose your column value.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This issue has gone unaddressed for too long. I'm re-assigning to Ralph for re-evaluation and categorization.

Will evaluate within 2 weeks.

Can you supply a test case / use case?
