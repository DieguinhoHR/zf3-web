ZF-2207: Make Zend\_config\_Ini and Zend\_Config\_Xml test if the file passed to them is readable

### Description

Actually, Zend\_Config\_Ini and Zend\_Config\_Xml never check if the file you try to access is readable. Instead of that, they try to load it ( respectively by parse\_ini\_file(), and simplexml\_load\_file ), thus making a warning appear if the file can't be found or read.

These classes should try to read the file passed to their constructor, before making buz with them, and throw exceptions if there's a problem. Actual Zend\_Config\_Ini code ( same for Zend\_Config\_Xml ) :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($filename, $section, $config = false)
        {
            if (empty($filename)) {
                throw new Zend_Config_Exception('Filename is not set');
            }
    (...)


Improvement :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct($filename, $section, $config = false)
        {
            if (empty($filename) || !is_readable($filename)) {
                throw new Zend_Config_Exception('Filename is not set');
            }
    (...)

Fixed in svn 6909 (trunk) and 6910 (release-1.0 branch)

Re-opened - is\_readable() broke BC (see ZF-2232)

To fix this, we'll have to use Zend\_Loader::isReadable() which will obviously introduce a dependency for Zend\_Config that isn't there at the moment.

Code would be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!Zend_Loader::isReadable($filename)) {
                throw new Zend_Config_Exception('Unable to read config file');
            }


Thoughts?

Yes Rob, that's the patch I think. I forgot about that \*\*\* include path ;-)

Won't fix in 1.x as we don't want to introduce a BC break by using is\_readable() or introduce a dependency on Zend\_Loader.

Workaround if the notice is a problem is to call Zend\_Loader::isReadable() before called Zend\_Config\_Ini/Zend\_Config\_Xml.

Regards,

Rob...
