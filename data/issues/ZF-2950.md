### Description

It would be nice if the dt and dd elements would have an id of their own by default, instead of having to set it manually. This would allow for easy js and css manipulation. (e.g. displaying/hiding an entire row etc.) The label id could have a "-label" suffix and and element id could have a "-element" suffix (naming suggestions are welcome):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Foo:
