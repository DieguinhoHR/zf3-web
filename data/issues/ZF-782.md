ZF-782: Add getLastResponse() to HTTP Client
--------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-01-21T10:13:08.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:41.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.1 (23/Mar/07)

### Description

The HTTP client currently has a getLastRequest() method but no getLastResponse() method. Adding this will make it easier to debug other Zend components that use the HTTP client internally, such as Zend\_Feed or Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client.

I added the method the class Zend\_Http\_Client to who I send the alteration, but not have privileges for comit

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Get the last HTTP response object
         * 
         * @return Zend_Http_Response
         */
        public function getLastResponse() {
            if ($this->last_response instanceof Zend_Http_Response) {
                return $this->last_response;
            } else {
                throw new Zend_Http_Exception('Response is empty');
            }
        }

I just committed r. 3030 which includes this feature implemented. Please try it and let me know if it works well for your needs.

I will close this bug once I update the documentation.
