ZF-9884: Zend\_Filter\_Input\_StringToUpper and \_StringToLower do not convert accented characters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I give a simple example of Portuguese. The word for action is "ação".

When I create a filter with Zend\_Filter\_StringToUpper() and call method filter for argument "ação", the result is "AçãO". When I create a filter with Zend\_Filter\_StringToLower() and call method filter for argument "AÇÃO", the result is "aÇÃo".

I think that this problem is equally inconvenient to speakers (and writers) of French and German, and others whose languages uses accents.

The filter must convert accent characters too.

I tried to use setlocale(LC\_ALL,"pt-BR"); before filter, but nothing has changed.

I am using PHP 5.2.

For me both filters are working also on german umlauts or accedent characters. This is even unittested.

Can you give an reproduceable example of your problem?

@Flavio

Try assign encoding.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $filter = new Zend_Filter_StringToUpper('UTF-8');
    echo $filter->filter('ação');

Aswering to Thomas Weidner, the example can be made into an indexAction() so:

public function indexAction() { $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_StringToUpper(); echo $filter->filter('ação'); exit; }

The response will be "AçãO".

However, I follow the guideline of Ramon Henrique Ornelas and change the code to:

public function indexAction() { $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_StringToUpper('UTF-8'); echo $filter->filter('ação'); exit; }

Setting the encoding of browser to UTF-8, the response was "AÇÃO".

So... that is not a bug... excuse me, and thank you at same time.
