ZF-3687: The OpenId provider class does not properly handle multiple scripts w/OpenId v2.0 and op\_endpoint

### Description

If you have three different (or multiple) scripts that will handle the OpenId authentication process (an handler script - for dispatching the OpenId mode/action, a login script and a trust script) the op\_endpoint OpenId parameter will be incorrectly set in the OpenId response to the Consumer causing the OpenId authentication to fail on the Consumer side. This happens in the Zend\_OpenId\_Provider::\_respond method. The current code does this to set the op\_endpoint parameter:

if ($version >= 2.0) { $ret["openid.op\_endpoint"] = Zend\_OpenId::selfUrl(); }

Which will return the current script that is processing. If there are multiple scripts involved the discovered OpenId server by the Consumer code will be whatever the OpenId server has in its link tag in the HTML header. If the trust script is not the same as what is present in the link tag of the header (most likely not if they are different scripts) then the returned op\_endpoint will not be the same and the checks on the Consumer side will fail.

I've added a property to the Zend\_OpenId\_Provider class called "\_op\_endpoint" and allowed this to be set during construction. If it isn't set it defaults to Zend\_OpenId::selfUrl() and this way follows the original design. I also changed the code in the Zend\_OpenId\_Provider::\_respond to be:

 
        if ($version >= 2.0) {
            $ret["openid.op_endpoint"] = $this->_op_endpoint;
        }


So this way the op\_endpoint can be specified by the programmer and therefore match the discovered server (or endpoint) in a multi-script design.

Thanks,

Mike
