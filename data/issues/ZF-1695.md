### Description

I'm not sure that this would exactly be considered a bug as it does state in the manual that helpers are camelcased. Anyways the problem is that accessing helpers via overloading is case-insensitive, but the gethelper function is case sensitive.

This will become a completely different instance than <?php echo $this->headTitle(); ?>

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Set default page title
    $view->getHelper('HeadTitle')->setTitle($appConfig->title);


This is the same instance as <?php echo $this->headTitle(); ?>

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // Set default page title
    $view->getHelper('headTitle')->setTitle($appConfig->title);

To clarify: when retrieving a helper, the reporter gets a different instance when the initial cap is different. Fixed in revision 6463.
