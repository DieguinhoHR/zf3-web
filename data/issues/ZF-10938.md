ZF-10938: Convert file size from string to integer

### Description

Converting string representation of file size or memory into bytes and backwards (e.g. 3M <=> 3145728) often usefull when using ini config files.

This code already used in ZF in such classes: - Zend\_Form\_Element\_File::\_convertIniToInteger - Zend\_Validate\_File\_fromByteString

but has different realisation and can't be used anywhere else.

Maybe it will be useful to create some static method to use in all ZF?

For example Zend\_Config\_Ini::byteToInteger and Zend\_Config\_Ini::integerToByte

I have my own method, which is more compact

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function str2byte($str)
    {
        if(is_numeric($str))
            return (int) $str;
    
        if(!preg_match('/^([0-9]+) ?([KMGTPEZY])?B?$/i', trim($str), $match))
            return 0;
    
        if(!empty($match[2]))
            return $match[1] * pow(1024, 1 + (int) stripos('KMGTPEZY', $match[2]));
    
        return (int) $match[1];
    
    }

There is already a class which handles this and takes care of other issues caused by convertion: Zend\_Measure\_Binary

Problem: Components are said to work independend from other components. Therefor a solution like yours is actually not accepted into the framework.

Information: The reason why those 2 methods are different is that they NEED to be different. PHP accepts only K,M and G as value. P or E are denied by PHP but needed for files where this value comes from the filesystem (64bit) and not from HTTP or an PHP configuration file.

Therefor closing this issue as won't fix.

Zend\_Measure\_Binary may be used only to convert from numbers to strings, not otherwice, and I want to convert from values like 3G (as in php.ini) to numbers, which may be used in calculations

I found just this to methods to do this conversion. Is any way to do this by using standart ZF components?

This is not correct. All Zend\_Measure classes can convert in ANY direction.

And all of the above mentioned classes ARE standard ZF components.
