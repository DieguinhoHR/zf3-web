ZF-8800: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::update() - does not support table alias

### Description

Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::update() doesn't seem to currently support alias for the table, e.g: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::update(array('A' => 'table\_name'), array('field' => 'value'), array('id = ?' => 1));

This is useful when using subselects which need to reference the main table that is being updated. I think the adapter should check whether the value passed as $table is an array, if so, treat it similarly as Zend\_Db\_Select::from(). If it's not an array, just escape it.

Current workaround: Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::update(new Zend\_Db\_Expr("table\_name AS A"), array('field' => 'value'), array('id = ?' => 1));

J.
