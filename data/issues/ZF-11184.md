### Description

Hello,

I noticed in case the uri passed to Zend\_Feed\_Reader::import($uri); is pointing to a blank page i am getting this error:

PHP Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML(): Empty string supplied as input in /path/ZendFramework-1.10.7/Zend/Feed/Reader.php on line 325

Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML(): Empty string supplied as input in /path/ZendFramework-1.10.7/Zend/Feed/Reader.php on line 325 End checking feeds

For the sake of easy to use i suggest so the Zend\_Feed\_Reader to check the input which is going to be passed to DOMDocument::loadXML() and in case detects empty (or maybe malformed) content to throw an error so to be easy for us to handle the situation.

I am not sure if the problem had been fixed post 1.10.7.

I checked on 1.11.4 code and doesn't seems to be fixed.

Reproducing test case plus fix. Applying patch had no visible consequence w.r.t execution of test suite.
