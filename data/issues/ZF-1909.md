### Description

I think there needs to be a method to return an array of all registered cache IDs with their tag arrays and expiration date. This is extremely useful, especially if you want to build your own cache manager, ala Nick Halstead's GUI cache manager for Zend\_Cache. Description and sample code available to make a "tag cloud" available at [http://blog.assembleron.com/2007/05/â€¦](http://blog.assembleron.com/2007/05/09/making-a-tag-cloud-out-of-zend_cache/)
