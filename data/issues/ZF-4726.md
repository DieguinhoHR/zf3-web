### Description

Not checking if a namespace is set in "apply" notice causes notice. This also affects applySet method.

Suggest that, instead of adding isset checks everywhere, a reference of the session var be stored and called upon instead throughout.

Is this still an issue for you? What is your reproduction code? I think this was an issue with PHP 5.1, but not with PHP 5.2.4+

Still an issue as ZF 1.11.10 w/ php 5.3. Code to reproduce:

$ns = new Zend\_Session\_Namespace(); $ns->applySet($callback);

If you are starting with fresh session, the error will raise every time.

Suggested code to fix the issue:

any place you have:

 
        $arg_list[0] = $_SESSION[$this->_namespace];


should be something like this:

 
        $arg_list[0] = isset($_SESSION[$this->_namespace]) ? $_SESSION[$this->_namespace] : NULL;
