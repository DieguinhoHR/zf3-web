### Description

Hello,

I am wondering if won't be a good addon to Zend\_Db\_Table to have relations auto-discover from metadata.

By example in case of InnoDb tables i find redundant to add the relationships both on tables and on Zend\_Db\_Table...

This is something I've researched in the past. I am gonna close this b/c it is no small undertaking. Something like this would either need to be discussed as a solution for 2.0, or a full proposal submitted for.

The problem, in short, is that even if you have relations that are formed in databases that support FK constraints, the FK itself does not give a developer any context. As for an example, think about how junction tables are used in 1-1, 1-M, and M-M relationships and how many FK's are required to build each conceptual relationship.

I'd be interested to hear your ideas after the 2.0 Zend\\Db adapter becomes more stable.
