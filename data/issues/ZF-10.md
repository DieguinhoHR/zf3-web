### Description

There are incorrect filtering methods names in Zend\_Filter\_Manual. According to the library, the filtering methods now should be prefixed by "test" but now they are prefixed by "is".

For example instead of isAlpha() should be testAlpha().

I'm wondering how should be prefixed static methods in Zend\_Filter class. In Zend\_Filter\_Input they are prefixed by "test" but in Zend\_Filter class they are still prefixed by "is".
