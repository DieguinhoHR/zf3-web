### Description

I tried to get a content of the class using something like that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $r = new Zend_Reflection_Class( 'My_Class' ); // My_Class is loaded by Zend_Autoloader
    echo $r->getContents();


Unfortunately I got the content end of class's cropped with number lines how many lines wass in the docblock (7 lines of docblock then 7 lines was removed from the file content). Also one line was trimmed from the begining of code when I passed true to this method ($includeDocblock).

When I changed lines 109 and 110 then it looks ok in both cases.

Below added suggested patch for this method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Index: Class.php

         {
             $filename  = $this->getFileName();
             $filelines = file($filename);
    -        $startnum  = $this->getStartLine($includeDocblock);
    -        $endnum    = $this->getEndLine() - $this->getStartLine();
    +        $startnum  = $this->getStartLine($includeDocblock)-1;
    +        $endnum    = $this->getEndLine() - $startnum;
     
             return implode('', array_splice($filelines, $startnum, $endnum, true));
         }

This file also corrupts content if "interface" is placed line below "class" declaration. This might be related.
