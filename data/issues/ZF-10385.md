ZF-10385: \\Zend\\Db\\Profiler\\Firebug generates an error due to wrong class name

### Description

\\Zend\\Db\\Profiler\\Firebug uses \\Zend\\Wildfire\\Plugin\\FirePhp to log to firebug.

But the setEnabled() method make a call to \\Zend\\Wildfire\\Plugin\\FirePhp\\FirePhp, which triggers an error due to unknown class.

Fixing that seems trivial, since it consists in replacing the call to \\Zend\\Wildfire\\Plugin\\FirePhp\\FirePhp with \\Zend\\Wildfire\\Plugin\\FirePhp
