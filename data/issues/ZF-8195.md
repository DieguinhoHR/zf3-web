### Description

When importing the following feed:

<http://vermontdailynews.com/feed/atom/>

and then iterating through the Entries and calling getCommentCount() on each, I get the following error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined function getCommentCount() in path\\to\\library\\Zend\\Feed\\Reader\\Entry\\Atom.php on line 298

Hi,

There was a typo in Zend\_Feed\_Reader\_Entry\_Atom on line 298:

$commentcount = $this->getExtension('Thread')>getCommentCount();

Attached patch fixes the issue:

$commentcount = $this->getExtension('Thread')->getCommentCount();

Fixed in r19192.

Extremely silly oversight on my part - I've added a task to add test coverage for the method in Atomland which is apparently missing. May have missed it in a commit previously.
