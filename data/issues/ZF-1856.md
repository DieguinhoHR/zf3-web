ZF-1856: Using subquery in from() is broken because of new schema logic

### Description

Using a subquery as the table argument in the from() call used to work fine, like so:

$select = $db->select(); $select->from("(select people.id from people)", "count(id)");

I know there are cleaner ways to get the same result, but this is a simplified version and in some cases it is necessary to do a select like this, for example when doing your own pagination you may want to put the sql from one query into a call like this to find out the number of rows returned from it.

When doing this, if the code in the table argument contains a period, the new schema code on line 358 in Select.php will break the query:

 
        // Schema from table name overrides schema argument
        if (false !== strpos($tableName, '.')) {
            list($schema, $tableName) = explode('.', $tableName);
        }

Same behavior with subselect queries with Zend\_Db\_Select :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db->select()
    ->from ('table1', array('t1_label'))
    ->joinInner(
          array('T2' => new Zend_Db_Expr (
             '('.
             $db->select()
             ->from('table2', array('t2_label'))
             ->where('condition')
             .')'
          )),
          'table1.t2_id = T2.t2_id',
          array('t2_label')
    )


breaks it as well :

    (SELECT
    ``table2<pre class="highlight">.t2_label``
    FROM ``table2``
    WHERE condition)

patch could be :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
      if (!$tableName instanceof Zend_Db_Expr && false !== strpos($tableName, '.')) {
                list($schema, $tableName) = explode('.', $tableName);
            }

This use-case can be avoided by using the Zend\_Db\_Expr object to enclose the subquery.
