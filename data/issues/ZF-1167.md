### Description

To me, the presence of the method addRole(), and the lack of a corresponding method addResource() looks like an inconsistency. Given our past diligence to resolve inconsistencies, this issue can record a decision regarding this for future reference.

That´s what the add() method is there for, isn´t it? Is this issue only about the name or am I missing someting obvious?

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Let's decide if we think this is worth doing and fix or close down the issue as necessary.

Method found in current rev 17577 of 1.9 branch, thanks for that. But now there is the inconsistency, that the other resource related methods has not their "Resource" suffix

- has() --> hasResource()
- remove() --> removeResource()
- removeAll() --> removeResourceAll()
- get() --> getResource()

I would also prefer to rename the "remove_All()" methods to "clear_()" as ... they sounds strange ^^ - removeRoleAll() -> clearRoles() - removeResourceAll() -> clearResources() Just a suggestion
