### Description

In ZF 1.6.2, when using the setOptions, there is a strtolower on the key ($this->\_options[strtolower($key)] = $option;). When using the getOptions(), also the key is lower cased, so not really a big issue.

Now in Zf 1.7.0, on the setOptions, there is no strtolower anymore, but it is still there in the getOptions. So that means that if you set an options camel cased, you won't be able to get it back with the getOptions method because you still lowercase the key in the getOptions but not in the setOptions.

So please choose one way to handle the options in the set and getOptions methods.
