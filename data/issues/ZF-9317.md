### Description

Quite a lot of Zend\_Rest\_Client methods are final, which makes it impossible to subclass.

It's a real limitation for ZF as a framework not to be able to easily subclass Zend\_Rest\_Client. It would be great if 'final' attribute got removed.

Strangely enough, Zend\_Rest\_Server has no final method. Am I missing something?

Enclosed is the diff realized against ZF 1.10.1

Regards, Remy

Added patch against trunk, likely also valid for 1.11 branch. This patch also fixes the issue that you can't sent data with a delete request.
