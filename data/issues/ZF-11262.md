### Description

The description for Zend\_Ldap bind(string $username, string $password) contains:

If both paramaters are omitted the binding will be carried out with the credentials given in the connection and binding parameters.

"paramaters" should be spelled "parameters".

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.ldap.api.html)

By the way, I didn't understand what this is saying. I now understand after reading the connect() description: All parameters are optional and will be taken from the LDAP connection and binding parameters passed to the instance via the construtor or via Zend\_Ldap::setOptions() when set to NULL.

There is another typo here, "construtor" instead of "constructor".

Thank You for report. Solved at SVN r23886 with Zend\_Log-Overview.xml and Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Ec2-Elasticip.xml that have same TYPO.
