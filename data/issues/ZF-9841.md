ZF-9841: Provide a public method to remove a previously added custom header
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2010-05-15T01:11:29.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-12-02T14:23:04.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s): - 1.11.0 (02/Nov/10)

### Description

Once you add a custom header on the Zend\_Mail object, there's no way to remove it.

For example:

$mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $mail->addHeader('List-Unsubscribe', 'somevalue');

There's no way to remove the List-Unsubscribe header.

You could provide public clearHeader($headerName) and proxy it to protected \_clearHeader($headerName) method.

Then you could remove the List-Unsubscribe header already set usig $mail->clearHeader('List-Unsubscribe');

I'm willing to provide a patch with unit test, if the suggestion is accepted.

It is a good idea. You would have to pay attention to the fact that you don't allow to delete standart headers defined in addHeader. The headers are stored in an array with the header name as key. Maybe you could provide an additional offset parameter in clearHeader($name,$offset = null) to allow delete only one header from the list or all headers with the given name.
