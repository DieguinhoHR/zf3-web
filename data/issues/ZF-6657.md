ZF-6657: Not variation of assertQuerys display same text to errors
------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-05-14T09:56:02.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:07.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The folowing script prints: Failed asserting node DENOTED BY #error DOES NOT EXIST

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testValidPostNovoAction() {
        $postArray = $this->default_post;
        $this->request->setPost($postArray);
    
        $this->request->setMethod('POST');
        $this->dispatch ( '/cadastro/novo' );
        $this->assertNotQuery('#error');
    }   


If "does not exist" there is no error. Another message is expected in this case. If running it with assertQuery instead of assertNotQuery the "Failed asserting" don't appears, so it's just a display text misleading. Specialy because assertQuery and assertNotQuery methods are identical, this can cause some head aches.
