### Description

There should be a possibility to cancel path autodiscovery from the class name, or a possibilty to specify directory separator as a function param of loadClass(). At the moment such class names as e.g. "Project\_has\_Manager" cannot be created, because the underscores in the class names are always replaced with the path separator.

See Loader.php, line:70

Zend\_Loader follows the PEAR class naming convention, which means underscores in class names correspond to directory separators.
