ZF-5767: Add getProxy() method to Zend\_Soap\_Client
----------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2009-02-12T15:53:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:22.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

It should be possible to call a "getProxy()" method and return the fully configured SOAPClient object in the rare case, when any of the many functions that is defined as public API in the Zend Soap Client is actually needed for a Remote call. Using \_\_call is ugly :-)
