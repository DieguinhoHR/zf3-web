### Description

Class Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormText should use getClosingBracket() method defined in Zend\_View\_Helper\_HtmlElement.

The code from Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormText:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // XHTML or HTML end tag?
    $endTag = ' />';
    if (($this->view instanceof Zend_View_Abstract) && !$this->view->doctype()->isXhtml()) {
        $endTag= '>';
    }


should be written as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // XHTML or HTML end tag?
    $endTag = $this->getClosingBracket();


The same applies to other form helpers that produce tag..

I get a failure when I apply your patch and run the entire Zend\_View\_Helper suite:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    There was 1 failure:
    
    1) Zend_View_Helper_FormImageTest::testRendersAsHtmlByDefault
    Failed asserting that > does not contain " />".
    
    /tests/Zend/View/Helper/FormImageTest.php:104


However, if I run only the ZF-11477 test suite (./runtests.sh ZF-11477), all those tests pass (including the one which failed above)

{quote}However, if I run only the ZF-11477 test suite (./runtests.sh ZF-11477), all those tests pass (including the one which failed above){quote} I think we also need to reset the doctype. Look at: tests/Zend/View/Helper/FormRadioTest.php ```

Yeah, it looks like somewhere along the line of Zend\_View\_Helper unit tests the default doctype is getting changed from HTML4\_LOOSE (as defined in class) to XHTML1\_STRICT. Havent't tried very hard yet to track down where...

I've combined and updated the patches provided (attached as ZF-11477\_adamlundrigan.patch). Everything appears OK to me...the test suites for Zend\_View and Zend\_Form still pass after applying patch. As this is basically just an exercise of DRY, and I can't see any evidence that it changes helper output, I vote to have it included in next mini release.
