### Description

Trying to return associative structs / arrays with XML-invalid keys (e.g. Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Query) breaks \_structValue.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _structValue($struct, DOMDocument $dom, DOMElement $parent)
        {
            $struct = (array) $struct;
    
            foreach ($struct as $key => $value) {
              // at this point $struct can have strange keys (.e.g "*_query")
              //  $key=preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]/','_',$key); // this could sanitize $key
                if ($value === false) {
                    $value = 0;
                } elseif ($value === true) {
                    $value = 1;
                }
    
                if (ctype_digit((string) $key)) {
                    $key = 'key_' . $key;
                }
    
                if (is_array($value) || is_object($value)) {
                    $element = $dom->createElement($key); // this is generates an exception because $key is invalid XML
    


Finally, the fault exception handler registered in the constructor fails to output anything because fault() is designed to return the DomDocument Instead. Suggest to register a separate handler.

Actually, the issue appears with private and protected object properties:

[ [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php) ] If an object is converted to an array, the result is an array whose elements are the object's properties. The keys are the member variable names, with a few notable exceptions: private variables have the class name prepended to the variable name; protected variables have a '\*' prepended to the variable name. These prepended values have null bytes on either side. This can result in some unexpected behaviour:

I don't think private/protected properties should be returned. Suggested fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        protected function _structValue($struct, DOMDocument $dom, DOMElement $parent)
        {
            if (is_object($struct)) $struct=get_object_vars($struct);
            
            $struct = (array) $struct;

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

See ZF-3338 - This issue has been fixed already in one of the many duplicate entries of this bug.
