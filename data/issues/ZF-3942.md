### Description

If I make this call on a view:

$this->view->addHelperPath(HELPER\_DIR,"");

I can get helpers in located in directory HELPER\_DIR. In 1.6.0RC1, I get an error saying that the class "\_HelperName" is not found in "HelperName.php". In 1.6.0RC2, the helper files seem to be simply ignored.

When adding a view helper path, you must either omit the prefix (which will cause it to use the prefix "Zend\_View\_Helper", or provide a valid prefix. Providing invalid prefixes, even empty strings, simply will not work, and an error condition is expected.
