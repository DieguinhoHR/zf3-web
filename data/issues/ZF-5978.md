### Description

Logger sanity check is performed at each Zend\_Cache\_Backend::setDirectives() call. So it's done at each logger object update. If logging directive is set but existing logger is not an instance of Zend\_Log then default logger is created instead instead of throwing exception.

\_log() method has a error. It throws an exception if "logger is not set" \*or\* if logger \*is\* an instance of Zend\_Log.
