### Description

The Zend\_Http\_Client::setAuth() method does not work properly when using the Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl adapter against a server that requires digest authentication. For example, this fails:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Curl();
    $adapter->setCurlOption(CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_DIGEST);
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setAdapter($adapter);
    $client->setUri($uri);
    $client->setAuth($user, $pass);
    $result = $client->request();


To make it work, you need to avoid the setAuth() method and instead pass the user/pass via a Curl option, like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapter = new Zend_Http_Client_Adapter_Curl();
    $adapter->setCurlOption(CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_DIGEST);
    $adapter->setCurlOption(CURLOPT_USERPWD, $user . ':' . $pass);
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client();
    $client->setAdapter($adapter);
    $client->setUri($uri);
    $result = $client->request();


Since the setAuth() method is defined in Zend\_Http\_Client and not in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Abstract (and thus not overridable in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl,) I'm not sure about the best way to fix this.
