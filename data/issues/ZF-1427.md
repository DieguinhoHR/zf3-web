### Description

PDO supports a connection attribute to perform case-folding by a few different policies. The PDO attribute ATTR\_CASE can have values:

- CASE\_LOWER - fold identifiers to all lowercase when returning result sets in FETCH\_ASSOC or FETCH\_BOTH modes.
- CASE\_UPPER - fold identifiers to all uppercase when returning result sets in FETCH\_ASSOC or FETCH\_BOTH modes.
- CASE\_NATURAL - do not fold case of identifiers; use the exact spelling that the RDBMS returns.

This is a feature request to permit the Adapter class to take an option in the constructor options.

If the Adapter is a PDO adapter, make this option cascade to set the corresponding PDO attribute in the underlying PDO connection object.

For non-PDO adapters, please implement matching behavior.

It is suggested that the option key be named simply "case", and the values match the existing const definitions Zend\_Db::CASE\_LOWER, Zend\_Db::CASE\_UPPER, and Zend\_Db::CASE\_NATURAL. The values of these consts are identical to the consts of the same name in PDO.

Please make the default value in all adapters CASE\_NATURAL.
