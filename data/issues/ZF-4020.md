### Description

When my header exceed 5000 characters, It is break into multiple parts. All parts seems to go out from my server (tested with my ZendStudio). They are not correctly combined on my Firefox (FF3.0, Firebug 1.2b07, FirePHP 0.1.1).

This looks like an issue with the FirePHP extension. I'll keep the ticket here and update it for convenience.

This is an issue with the FirePHP Plugin.

The problem is caused by headers being trimmed if there is whitespace at the beginning or end of the header value.

I will be updating the wildfire protocol to include a "|" character at the beginning and end of the header values to ensure whitespace is not trimmed.

This is OK for me. ZF SVN 11073, FF3.0.1, Firebug 1.2.0, FirePHP 0.1.2
