### Description

There is a bug in the \_prepareFiles call in /Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Http.php. We are using 1.10. See the error shown below.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    Exception 'ErrorException' with message 'Notice: Undefined index:  tmp_name' in [...]/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php:1269
    Stack trace:
    #0 [...]/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php(1269): Init->errorToException(Array)
    #1 [...]/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Http.php(452): Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Abstract->_detectMimeType()
    #2 [...]/Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Http.php(52): Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http->_prepareFiles()


This occurs because of the order of the $\_FILES keys. \_prepareFiles() iterates through $\_FILES's keys, setting a variable within the iteration which is passed to \_detectMimeType(). tmp\_name is the second key from $\_FILES, but \_detectMimeType() uses that index in the first iteration, thus throwing the notice. A \*really\* dirty fix would be to insert the following on line 441:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $this->_files[$form . '_' . $number . '_']['tmp_name']  = $content['tmp_name'][$number];


Looking at the \_prepareFiles() method, it's probably best to rewrite it ;-)
