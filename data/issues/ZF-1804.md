ZF-1804: Zend\_Validate\_Date uses improper regular expression
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-08-02T14:04:24.000+0000 Last Updated: 2008-01-23T18:28:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.0.2 (25/Sep/07)

### Description

Currently Zend\_Validate\_Date uses the following regular expression: /\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}/ In this approach all the strings with a proper date at the beginning and any text at the end (such as: "2007-08-02something") are validated as a proper date. The regular expression which should be used in Zend\_Validate\_Date is following: /^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$/

I feel the regular expression should be extended further. Something like /^\\d{4}([- \\/.])(0[1-9]|1[0-2])\\1([0-2][0-9]|3[0-1])$/ (assuming yyyy-mm-dd) would strike a good balance between full validation and keeping the expression fairly simple.

Resolved for 1.1.0 with [SVN r6110](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6110).

Oh, I also meant to mention that since [checkdate()](http://php.net/checkdate) is in use, a more complicated regular expression should not be needed.

Would you please review [SVN r6110](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=6110) to make sure it's good, and then I'll merge the fixes to the 1.0 release branch for inclusion with ZF 1.0.2.

Thank you!

I hadn't spotted checkdate in there, that makes a lot of sense ;)! Looks good to me, I don't know whether you would want to add a test for leading characters as well, for completeness?

:)
