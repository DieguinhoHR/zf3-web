### Description

Using the SVN Incubator branch with PHP 5.3 from cli I got some annoying warnings:

Warning: The magic method \_\_get() must have public visibility and can not be static in /incubator/library/Zend/Console/Getopt.php on line 260

Warning: The magic method \_\_isset() must have public visibility and can not be static in /incubator/library/Zend/Console/Getopt.php on line 271

Warning: The magic method \_\_set() must have public visibility and can not be static in /incubator/library/Zend/Console/Getopt.php on line 288

The warning seems to be default and are the same for

private function \_\_get($name); protected function \_\_get($name); static function \_\_get($name);
