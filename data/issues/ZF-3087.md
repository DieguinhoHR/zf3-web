Re-assigning to Ralph; removed component 'Zend\_Form' and replaced with the more appropriate 'Zend\_Layout'.

Your issue (from my perspective) seems to be stemming from the fact that you are utilizing Zend\_Layout's MVC integration in a non-MVC way. When using Zend\_Layout::startMvc(), you should only have a single place where your layout scripts will reside.

For example, if you were to do this: Zend\_Layout::startMvc(array('layoutPath' => APP\_PATH . '/layouts/')), then ALL modules will be pulling layouts from the same directory. This is the intended usage of Zend\_Layout. On the other hand, you might be able to pull off what you are attempting by using Zend\_Layout as an object $layout = new Zend\_Layout(array('layoutPath'=>'path/to/modules/layouts')); and utilizing that layout object inside of your module only.

In any case, there are a few different ways to accomplish "local layouts" but using Zend\_Layout::startMvc() isnt one of them since the intention of that use case is to be module independent.

Yea, this bug was filed a while ago, before the standard directory structure included a common layouts folder. Since this bug has been addressed by that, I'd say it's safe to close as "Won't Fix"
