ZF-1043: Parenthesize terms in WHERE clause to make precedence more predictable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2007-03-12T14:57:39.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-05T14:43:55.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 0.9.0 (17/Mar/07)

### Description

The following usage of Zend\_Db\_Select may result in an unexpected result:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select = $db->select();
    $select->from('foo', array('x'));
    $select->where('a = 1 OR b = 2');
    $select->where('c = 3 OR d = 4');


This creates the SQL:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT x
    FROM foo
    WHERE a = 1 OR b = 2 AND c = 3 OR d = 4


Because OR has lower precedence than AND, the result of this query is perhaps not what is desired.

Please put parentheses around each term that are combined with AND, to resolve precedence issues.
