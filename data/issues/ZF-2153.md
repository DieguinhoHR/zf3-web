Is this referring to a daemon-style solution, or merely the ability to create feeds with Zend\_Feed? At this point, I think the latter capability is supported, and it may just be that this issue was filed prior to that support being added. Please elaborate.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

Zend\_Feed's purpose is to consume and generate feeds. Serving them is a simple matter handled by any Controller. To preserve a greater range of response flexibility, it would not be appropriate to implement Zend\_Feed as a "server". Such functionality has little worth in an MVC application, and a standalone implementation would not offer much of value.
