### Description

 
    *  I am trying to do this
                  -Initialize FrontController with Request_Apache404 
                  -Set my .htacess with ErrorHandler 404 to bootstrap.                   
                  -Write my Controllers and wait for parameters in the way as documentation say "?parameter=value" or "parameter/value"
                  -In example 1 : /controllerexample/actionexample/format/json
                  -In example 2 : /controllerexample/actionexample?format=json
    
       * The result I get is this
                  -In example 1: Work OK. Json output.
                  -In example 2:The  same output as format wasn't send.
    
         * This is how I did it
                   -The class Zend_Controller_Request_Apache404 isnt work with $_SERVER['REDIRECT_QUERYSTRING'] where the Apache 404 ErrorHandler method let _GET variables of original request.


bq.May-Be Solution Example: **'parse\_str($\_SERVER['REDIRECT\_QUERYSTRING'],$\_GET);'** or write logic of **if-elseif-else** in Method overwrited method 'setRequestUri' in 'Zend\_Controller\_Request\_Apache404' (if you see the code of this methods in last lines do something about re-generate $\_GET but only when parameter is passed)

I really cannot understand exactly what issue is being reported. Can the original reporter please update the issue and indicate clearly and concisely the expectation and actual results? I.e.:

- I am trying to do this
- The result I get is this
- This is how I did it

Thanks!

Unassigning until we get feedback from reporter.
