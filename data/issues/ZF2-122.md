ZF2-122: Cookies lost between requests in Http\\Client
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2011-12-17T13:45:47.000+0000 Last Updated: 2011-12-18T13:13:07.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Create a Http\\Request (GET or POST alike) and send it via Http\\Client
=======================================================================

The destination page sets a cookie.
===================================

The destination page returns 302 REDIRECT
=========================================

Http\\Client clears all GET, POST and Cookie data
=================================================

A new GET request is sent to destination page without Cookies.
==============================================================

Because the second request after a redirect is missing cookies, cookie-based sessions will not work hence disabling functionality of most web pages and services.
