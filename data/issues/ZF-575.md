### Description

First of all, excuse my poor english level :(

An exemple for explain the issue. In the code bellow, i espect to have 4 emails. Each one whith 1 recipient. In fact i receved 4 emails with cumulative recipient.

mail 1 : To: first@somewhere.net mail 2 : To: first@somewhere.net, second@somewhere.net mail 3 : To: first@somewhere.net, second@somewhere.net, first@anotherone.net mail 4 : To: first@somewhere.net, second@somewhere.net, first@anotherone.net, second@anotherone.net

    <pre class="highlight">
    ...
    $this->emailList['first@somewhere.net']   = new stdClass();
    $this->emailList['second@somewhere.net']  = new stdClass();
    $this->emailList['first@anotherone.net']  = new stdClass();
    $this->emailList['second@anotherone.net'] = new stdClass();
    
    ...
    
    foreach ( $this->emailList as $toEmail => $el) {
      $mail = new Zend_Mail('UTF-8');
      
      $mail->setBodyHtml($this->generateHtmlBody($el));
      
      $mail->addTo($toEmail,$toEmail);
      $mail->setSubject('test mail');
      
      $mail->send();
      unset($mail);
    }

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for 0.7.0 release.

The code snippet supplied is, in fact, working as intended. For each loop iteration you are calling addTo, which is exactly what the Zend\_Mail object is doing and therefore you end up with cumulative recipients.

I suggest that this is really more of a feature request, as the behaviour you are expecting is more likely to be resolved with a 'setTo()' method.

To this end, could I also suggest the following to assist with better control over the behaviour of Zend\_Mail:-

- setTo() - clears current 'To' headers before adding recipient
- hasHeader($id) - returns boolean for existence of a header name (will be called from setTo())
- removeHeader() - removes header from mail object (will be called from setTo())

I believe the hasHeader and removeHeader deserve to be public methods to complement the addHeader method.

If there's no strong objection we can hopefully add these shortly.

I just saw the 'unset($mail)' there so I guess you WERE expecting the mail to only have one address. This particular issue may have been resolved by ZF-608 - can you please verify?
