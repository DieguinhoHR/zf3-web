ZF2-491: Zend\\Validate translations out of date
------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2012-08-22T21:08:16.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:14:54.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

A couple of issues:

1. I noticed that the validation message for Zend\\Validator\\Csrf is missing in the translation files under /resources/languages.
2. There are messages for a validator Zend\_Validate\_Ccnum that does not exist in Zf2
3. The messages for Zend\_Validate\_CreditCard have changed if I compare them with Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard
4. Other issues may also be in there

I guess the whole file needs to be updated and all translation files as well.

Example file: [https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/â€¦](https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/blob/master/resources/languages/en/Zend_Validate.php)

Anyway, should the file not be called Zend\_Validator.php?

What about using the text identifier from the class instead of the message? Example

Instead of using

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        "Value is required and can't be empty" => "Value is required and can't be empty",


we could use

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        "isEmpty" => "Value is required and can't be empty",

Translations for EmailAddress and Regex Validator also have changed and are not translated anymore.
