### Description

Using the default directory layout, the documentation suggests that one should be able to place views at APPLICATION\_PATH /views/helpers, using "View\_Helper" as the marker, and have that be loaded by Zend\_View.

(The specific doc is [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader-resource.html))

The Module Resource Autoloader normally looks for the "appnamespace" entry in the ini file, and uses that as the prefix for the given resources. Therefore, if I set my appnamespace to "Cas", then I should be able to put Cas\_View\_Helper\_HeadLine in the $/views/helpers directory, and have it be loaded. However, it is only loaded if the prefix is "Zend\_" instead of the given appnamespace.

There is a workaround; to place the following in your application configuration file:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.view.helperPath.Cas_View_Helper = APPLICATION_PATH "/views/helpers/"
