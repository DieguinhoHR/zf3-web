ZF-11245: Zend\_Form::loadDefaultDecorators() is called too late in constructor

### Description

I've a subclass that extends the _Zend\_Form_ class. In my _My\_Class::init()_ method, I sets a "Description" decorator like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function init()
        {
            $this->setName('loginForm');
            $this->setElementsBelongTo('loginForm');
    
            $this->setDescription('Authentication')
                ->addDecorator('Description', array('placement' => 'prepend'));
    
            ...
        }


Unfortunately, When the Form is rendered, only the part belong to the Description is displayed. I've searched, and it's seem that the call of _Zend\_Form::loadDefaultDecorators()_ is made too late (just after the init() method) in the constructor because _Zend\_Form::loadDefaultDecorators()_ load defaults decorators only if no one is already set:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function loadDefaultDecorators()
        {
            if ($this->loadDefaultDecoratorsIsDisabled()) {
                return $this;
            }
    
            $decorators = $this->getDecorators();
            if (empty($decorators)) {
                $this->addDecorator('FormElements')
                     ->addDecorator('HtmlTag', array('tag' => 'dl', 'class' => 'zend_form'))
                     ->addDecorator('Form');
            }
            return $this;
        }


The problem seem to be fixed when the call _Zend\_Form::loadDefaultDecorators()_ is made before the _Zend\_Form::init()_ method. Now, maybe it's a wrong way to fix this issue... Of course, I can process like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function init()
        {
            $this->setName('loginForm');
            $this->setElementsBelongTo('loginForm');
    
            // Force to load Form default decorators
            $this->loadDefaultDecorators();
    
            $this->setDescription('Authentication')
                ->addDecorator('Description', array('placement' => 'prepend'));
    
            ...
        }


but that seem to be a bad workaround since we have now a double call of the _Zend\_Form::loadDefaultDecorators()_ method.

Sorry for my poor English, I'm French.

This is by design. loadDefaultDecorators() occurs after init() to allow init() to override the default decorators.

You can simply call $this->loadDefaultDecorators() in your init() method (as you've done in your last example) if you wish to use those as the base and simply add to them.

ok, thanks you for the answer here. For me that seem to be wrong and not conform to the default behavior. Indeed, when we use the _Zend\_Form_ class without extending it, default decorators are always loaded, and if we want not them, we can use the _Zend\_Form::setDisableLoadDefaultDecorators()_ setter to set the appropriate flag. To resume, in case where we use the init() method in subclass, the default behavior is changed. That seem to be an inconsistency in the implementation.

setDisableLoadDefaultDecorators() is intended for use cases where you do not wish to use decorators at all. loadDefaultDecorators() is intended for cases where there are no decorators already instantiated (nor disabled) by the end of object construction; its purpose is to allow developers to lazily override via init() or configuration.

Again, the behavior is intended and documented; changing it at this time would introduce a very large backwards compatibility break.

No problem ; It was just my opinion. I known your competences and I trust you.
