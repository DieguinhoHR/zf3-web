ZF-1505: 'ORDER BY' SQL query works imperfectly, does not accommodate 'DESC'

### Description

I'm working with the Zend\_DB\_Table class, and trying to build a news management system. This class successfully implements the code $order = 'id'. It does not accommodate $order = 'id DESC'. The problem may be that the Mysqli Adapter file does not include a routine to implement 'ASC | DESC'.

I cannot reproduce any issue here. We have tests for Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchAll() and Zend\_Db\_Table::fetchRow() that specify both ASC and DESC order and they run fine on all supported databases, including Mysqli.

If you want to reopen this issue, please provide code for test case that demonstrates a failure.

Thanks. Rob from Akrabat indicated the code to make DESC work. I am sorry for the waste of time I caused. the problem stemmed from my inadequate knowledge of PHP OOP !

The following worked perfectly in my Controller:

function indexAction() { $this->view->title = "some title";

 
        $news = new News();
        $this->view->news = $news->fetchAll(null, 'id desc');
    }
