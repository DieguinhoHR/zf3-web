ZF-12041: Zend filter underscore to camel case retains underscore if the string contains a numeric
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

When filtering a string with underscore to camel case, underscores are retained if the string contains a numeric.

$a = 'this\_has\_a\_24\_number'; $filter = new Zend\_Filter\_Word\_UnderscoreToCamelCase(); echo $filter->filter($a);

OUTPUT: ThisHasA\_24Number

I'm not entirely sure if this is the expected behaviour or not as you obviously cannot camel case numerics. However I feel the underscore should at least be removed after being passed through the filter.
