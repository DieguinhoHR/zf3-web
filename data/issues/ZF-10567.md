### Description

I was following a tutorial from a book, I created a contact form with - name - email - textarea - captcha after i clicked the submit button i got this error

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 261904 bytes) in C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\zf\\square\\library\\Zend\\Mail.php on line 1174

then I tried increasing my memory limit.and restarted apache, then re-run my app, and i still get the same error.. to be honest am not sure if this is a bug or it's just me or my machine

This is not a bug. Your provided code has a lot of typos.

The problem can be solved by removing the $mail from send().

So: $mail->send($mail); should become: $mail->send();

best regards René
