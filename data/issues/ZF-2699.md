### Description

formError view helper automatically escapes the messages returned by validators.

We should enable/disable the automatic escaping, so the messages could contains HTML strings.

Scheduling for 1.5.0 GA release. FormElement already searches for escape flag; will make FormErrors helper aware of the flag.

Fix committed to trunk and release branch.

formErrors() helper now allows passing 'escape' as one option in $options array; when set to false, no escaping will be done on the messages:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->formErrors($errors, array('escape' => false));


The FormErrors decorator will pass its escape option on to the formErrors view helper.
