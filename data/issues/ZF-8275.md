### Description

baseUrl view helper example error, base html tag works just with an absolute url and the baseUrl helper cuts the domain part, here's the example: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.baseurl) and the tag reference [http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag\_base.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_base.asp)

Can you please provide me with: \* What is being produced by the baseUrl() view helper \* What you actually want it to produce \* Indicate how you would call it to achieve these results.

This is my url: <http://192.168.2.3/MyProject/public> so when I print the baseUrl return I got this: /MyProject/public so, the base tag needs the entire url (with the domain part <http://192.168.2.3/MyProject/public>) maybe you can add an extra argument to get the domain part too.

There are some difficulties with honoring this request. \* Clearly the scheme needs to be returned as well, but what if the current page is under SSL, and the page you want to link to doesn't require SSL? \* Should the port be included? This looks like up to three additional arguments, all of them optional, which would make for a cumbersome API.

My thought is that it would be best to have a separate helper for generating the scheme + host + port portion of the URL, and using it in conjunction to the baseUrl() view helper:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    echo $this->hostName() . $this->baseUrl();


If you would like to see this feature, please create a proposal for it to ensure we capture all the requirements.

What about the serverUrl view helper? This is exactly what it does.
