ZF-4450: Problem with wrong splitted/encoded mail-subjects

### Description

We had two problems with the Zend\_Mime\_Decode::splitMessage()-method:

A lot of mail-headers (maybe they are not really rfc-conform) couldn't be splitted correctly by the native php-function iconv\_mime\_decode\_headers() used by the framework. e.g.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    iconv_mime_decode_headers() => array( ..., [subject] => '=?iso-8859-1?q?=AB=CD?=\nX-Priority: 3', ...)


Some subject-strings encoded in the following way

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    =?(utf-8|iso-8859-1|...)?(q|b)?......?=


couldn't be decoded by the iconv-function. Therefore we used the mb\_decode\_mimeheader()-function for those messages.

For the headers that couldn't be decoded: did you check your setting for iconv.internal\_encoding? Don't have multibyte here to test.

Our iconv.internal\_encoding is always UTF-8!

Hi, Robert.

Is this issue still active? We have fixed many issues between 1.7.2 and 1.7.4 .

Hi!

Unfortunately the project using the patch posted some months ago is currently running under the zf-version 1.6.1 - never touch a running system ;) It isn't also possible to upgrade for a short test, because there is a lot of bootstapping-changes and so on. Whenever the project will be upgraded to a newer version of zf I will look at all this features and patches again and give you entire feedback.

For me it would make sense to have the possibility to inject Zend\_Mime into Zend\_Mail, so everyone would be able to extend some functionality inside there.

I can confirm the header splitting issue still exists in 1.10beta1

It actually happend quite often because a common scenario is to have a domain key header immediately followed by the message-id header. Often a domain key signature will have the offending string end; and so the message-id header gets swallowed into the domain key header.

I sampled about 20k emails from a local maildir store and the failure to split the headers correctly happened roughly 5% of the time.

I cannot confirm the inconv/mbstring decoding issue exists, I did not notice it specifically nor did I test for it.

Anyway, the regex replace for the splitting issue is good, attaching patch with unit test that replicates the splitting issue.

Test case reproduces issue + trivial fix.

Thank you for Your collaboration, Graham Anderson . I will look at Your suggestion deeply.
