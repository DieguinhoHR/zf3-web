ZF-6384: service methods called on the wrong instance of the service class

### Description

When the object passed as argument is an instance of a class whose constructor requires arguments, an instantiation error is raised on service call. I'm using 1.7.8 version of ZF. I've done some debug and found that in Zend/Amf/Server.php (\_dispatch method) the service method is called on a NEW instance of the declaring class obtained by reflection on line 210 created with default constructor, object passed to setClass() as I expected. This behavior seems to raise the instantiation trouble I've mentioned; moreover, this behavior seems to be inconsistent w.r.t. the one observed, for example, in Zend/Json/Server component.
