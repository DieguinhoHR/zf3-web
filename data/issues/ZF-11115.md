ZF-11115: Zend Translate / realpath() is not tolerant of phar paths
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend Translate is not tolerant of phar paths because the use of the PHP realpath() function, which causes phar paths to be returned as 'false'.

Zend\_Translate\_Adapter::addTranslation() example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        $options['content'] = realpath($options['content']);


A path of '<a>phar://foo.phar</a>' will result in a returned value of 'false'

Proposed patch:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strpos($options['content'], '://') === false) {
        $options['content'] = realpath($options['content']);
    }


This is a currently known PHP bug, but has not yet been fixed: <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52769>

Not accepted This would disallow the usage of network and uripaths as translation source

Thomas: I understand you didn't accept the proposed solution, but this is still an important use case. If the proposed solution does not work, then work with the reporter to find a solution that supports phar as well as network and URI paths.

Since this is a phar specific issue, we can just exclude phar streams from using realpath().

Proposed patch updated:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (strpos($options['content'], 'phar://') === false) {
        $options['content'] = realpath($options['content']);
    }
