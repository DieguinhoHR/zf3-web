### Description

Hi,

I've been trying to create unit tests for my application that includes tests that access a database I've set up. In production code everything works as expected (i.e I can fetch a row, perform Inserts etc) but when running the same code with the same database I get corrupt results on any type of SELECT statement (be it a find(), fetchRow(), fetchAll() etc). The columns returned end up being either missed completely or named incorrectly (usually with the database/table name replacing the column name). If I have more than 5 columns in my table fastcgi.exe crashes completely.

I've created a small test:

public function testdbAccess() { $db = Zend\_Db::factory('Pdo\_Mysql', array( 'host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'root', 'password' => 'xxxxx', 'dbname' => 'testdb' ));

 
     $sql = "select * from payment where id = ?";
     $data = 1; 
    
     $set = $db->fetchAll($sql,$data);


}

which still gives me problems.

In the debugger, the variable window shows:

$set | 0\_ Array[4] id 1 merchant OUR\_REF payment 1 testdb 3

And my Table is actually

db: testdb table: payment

id | merchant | payment\_type\_id | order\_id | track\_id 1 OUR\_REF 1 3 1 2 ... ...

so I'm getting the table name replacing column 3's name, db name replacing column 4's name and column 5 is missing. If I have another column in the table I get the fastcgi.exe crash.

Do you have any ideas about this? I found a similar issue reported (search ' too many columns crashes') but it was closed without an answer.

Many thanks,

Bryn

A simple unit test shows that Zend\_Db behaves properly, independent from platform.

 
    <pre class="literal">
      1 <?php
      2 
      3 require_once 'PHPUnit/Framework.php';
      4 require_once 'Zend/Db.php';
      5 class MyDbTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
      6 {
      7         /**
      8          * populated db table 'payment' with 3 rows
      9          *
     10          * id | merchant | payment_type_id | order_id | track_id
     11          * 1|test 1|1|3|1
     12          * 2|test 2|1|3|2
     13          * 3|test 3|1|3|2
     14          */
     15         public function testDbAccess()
     16         {
     17                 $db = Zend_Db::factory(
     18                         'Pdo_SQLite',
     19                         array ('dbname' => './testdb.db')
     20                 );
     21 
     22                 $sql = 'SELECT * FROM payment WHERE id = ?';
     23                 $data = 1;
     24                 $set = $db->fetchAll($sql, $data);
     25                 $this->assertType('array', $set);
     26                 $this->assertSame(1, count($set));
     27                 $this->assertArrayHasKey('id', $set[0]);
     28                 $this->assertArrayHasKey('merchant', $set[0]);
     29                 $this->assertArrayHasKey('payment_type_id', $set[0]);
     30                 $this->assertArrayHasKey('order_id', $set[0]);
     31                 $this->assertArrayHasKey('track_id', $set[0]);
     32         }
     33 }


Output of PHPUnit is a success:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    phpunit MyDbTest ./zf-8209.php 
    PHPUnit 3.4.2 by Sebastian Bergmann.
    
    .
    
    Time: 0 seconds
    
    OK (1 test, 7 assertions)

The problems I describe occur only with pdo\_mySql and not SQLite - in fact we are using sqlite in order to get around this issue. More than 4 columns in a table and you get a crash, less than 4 and you get corrupt record names.

Cheers, Bryn

Ok, let me rework my unit test using a MySQL database then. Which flavor of MySQL are you having this experience with ?

Cannot reproduce the error, had following unit test run against both MySQL 5.0 and 5.1 databases.

Please use following unit test to reproduce your error.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    <?php
    
    require_once 'PHPUnit/Framework.php';
    require_once 'Zend/Db.php';
    class MyDbTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
            /**
             * populated db table 'payment' with 3 rows
             *
             * id | merchant | payment_type_id | order_id | track_id
             * 1|test 1|1|3|1
             * 2|test 2|1|3|2
             * 3|test 3|1|3|2
             */
            public function testDbAccess()
            {
                    $db = Zend_Db::factory(
                            'Pdo_MySQL',
                            array (
                                    'host'          => 'localhost',
                                    'username'      => 'zfbhd',
                                    'password'      => 'secret',
                                    'dbname'        => 'test'
                            )
                    );
    
                    $sql = 'SELECT * FROM payment WHERE id = ?';
                    $data = 1;
                    $set = $db->fetchAll($sql, $data);
                    $this->assertType('array', $set);
                    $this->assertSame(1, count($set));
                    $this->assertArrayHasKey('id', $set[0]);
                    $this->assertArrayHasKey('merchant', $set[0]);
                    $this->assertArrayHasKey('payment_type_id', $set[0]);
                    $this->assertArrayHasKey('order_id', $set[0]);
                    $this->assertArrayHasKey('track_id', $set[0]);
            }
    }


Until further notice, I set the status of this issue again to resolved...

Hi,

I've attached a screenshot that highlights the issues I have when I run your test code.

Running MySQL 5.1.36-community via TCP/IP

Zend Studio Version 7.1.0.20091014 (Though this issue has appeared in previous versions).

As I say, if this test code is chucked into say, a controller, it executes fine. But as a test it becomes corrupt.

Cheers,

Bryn
