I am having trouble reproducing this issue, I have just done a fresh build of the documentation and it is showing the correct year.

You can see the problem in this link: [[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/copyrights.html)]

This only occurs when the documentation is built using PhD and not with the old method.

Ok, have managed to recreate this issue using PhD, will look into it tomorrow.

This issue was supposed to be fixed in PhD 1.0.0 but I have just run a build with 1.0.1 and I am still not getting the date.

Ok, looks like my PhD wasnt installed properly.

I have built the documentation using the latest PhD build from <https://github.com/php/phd> and the dbtimestamp are correctly parsed.

I dont have write access to the SVN repo so I can't update the build tools so hopefully someone with SVN write access will do it.
