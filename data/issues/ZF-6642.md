### Description

With this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $cb = new Zend_Form_Element_Checkbox('agree');
    $cb->setLabel('Agree')->setRequired(true);
    $subform->addElement($cb);
    // + some magic with decorators (should not influence the issue)


will the checkbox not validate on form submit with message "non-empty value required" even when checked. $\_POST dump:

 
    <pre class="highlight">array(2) {
      ["therms"] => array(1) {
        ["agree"] => string(1) "1"
      }
      ["next"] => string(27) "Finish"
    }


$form->getValues() dump:

 
    <pre class="highlight">array(1) {
      ["therms"] => array(1) {
        ["agree"] => string(1) "1"
      }
    }
