### Description

Hello,

I think there is an error in Zend\_Db Select class.

In this first example the query crashes.

$cols = array("test" => "(SELECT tt1.col2\_name FROM test\_table AS tt1 WHERE tt1.col1 = another\_table.col123)";

$qry\_sel = $this->mdb\_conn ->SELECT() ->FROM("another\_table", $cols);

After I have edit the first subquery it works fine.

$cols = array("(SELECT tt1.col2\_name FROM test\_table AS tt1 WHERE tt1.col1 = another\_table.col123) AS test";

It should be the same but it isn't. I don't know why but the first example of a subquery doesn't work.

If you use Zend\_Db\_Expr it works fine:

$cols = array("test" => new Zend\_Db\_Expr("(SELECT tt1.col2\_name FROM test\_table AS tt1 WHERE tt1.col1 = another\_table.col123)"));

Your subquery was being escaped with '`'.

Hope that helps.
