### Description

Oracle supports DB Links in order to query remote schemas via the following syntax

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT TABLE_NAME.* FROM SCHEMA.TABLE_NAME@LINK


Using Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, if I use something like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_schema = 'SCHEMA';
    protected $_name = 'TABLE_NAME@LINK';


the generated identifiers in SELECT statements appears as

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "TABLE_NAME@LINK".* FROM "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME@LINK" ...


when it should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "TABLE_NAME".* FROM "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME"@"LINK" ...


The issue is that the @ should not be quoted in the FROM clause nor should the link be included in the column prefix.

P.S. We're stuck at ZF 1.7.4 due to RHEL PHP version however a quick glance at 1.9.1 does not seem to indicate that this issue is resolved.

does this not work?

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected $_name = 'TABLE_NAME"@"LINK'

Sorry Ralph, it doesn't. That property generates queries like

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "TABLE_NAME""@""LINK".* FROM "SCHEMA"."TABLE_NAME""@""LINK" ...


notice the extra quotes?

The problem isn't just quoting however. The link name should only appear in the FROM clause. See the last code example in my bug report above for the correct syntax.

Something tells me this will be difficult to implement into Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract without affecting other, non-Oracle use cases. A solution is to create a synonym for the linked entity however this requires specific access to the schema in question and reduces portability.

The problem is that you can create a table with @ inside the name (at least with Oracle), this code functions:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE "ZFTEST"."FOO@BAR" ("ID" NUMBER(10) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY("ID"));


If you access to this table from a link BAZ:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "ID" FROM "ZFTEST"."FOO@BAR"@BAZ


The link must be differentiate from the table name.

Perhaps you can use:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Table extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->_name = new Zend_Db_Expr('TABLE_NAME@LINK');
        }
    }


or

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Table extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->_name = new Zend_Db_Expr('"TABLE_NAME"@"LINK"');
        }
    }


I didn't try but it should work.

No, that still won't work as the link identifier must only appear in the FROM clause.

As Mickael pointed out above, the link would have to be separate from the table name (ie, new property).

After a test this function for me:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class My_Table extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $this->_name = new Zend_Db_Expr('"TABLE_NAME"@"LINK"');
            $this->_cols = array('ID', 'MY_VAL', 'MY_COMMENTS');
            $this->_primary = array('ID');
        }
    }
    $myTable = new My_Table();
    var_dump($myTable->fetchAll()->toArray());


The generated SQL is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT t.* FROM "TABLE_NAME"@"LINK" t


I must define the column and the primary key by hand.

Except using the proposed solution, you can't do it.

Even if we add the support of the link in Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, you don't have access to the remote server to retrieve the description of the table.
