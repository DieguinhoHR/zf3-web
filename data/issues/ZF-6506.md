ZF-6506: No mention of isValid context variable in new docs

### Description

I'm sure there used to be an example of validating that two password fields matched in the docs for Zend\_Validate.

In any event, there is currently no mention at all of the optional second 'context' parameter to isValid().

This is and will cause problems for new users, as validating fields against each other is a basic requirement.

Apologies if this is still here and I've somehow missed it, I've looked twice! Cheers, Mark

Can you please explane what you are speaking of ?

Zend\_Validate->isValid() defines only ONE parameter. There is no additional context parameter within Zend\_Validate.

Maybe you've mixed this with a custom class of your own ?

Perhaps I'm confused about the line between the validation in Zend\_Form and Zend\_Validate.

The docs I was thinking of are actually at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.elements.html#zend.form.elements.validators) See the Note on "Validation Context" about 1/3 of the way down.

Not sure if this should be included in the Zend\_Validate docs or not; apologies if not.

As you already noted this is a feature of Zend\_Form and not from Zend\_Validate. It allows to use self defined validators and attach data from subforms to them.

Zend\_Validate does not provide context within the default validators.

Closing as non-issue as mentioned feature is a Zend\_Form feature and already mentioned there.

The Zend\_Validate docs should also have a note of this, as validating against other items in the data set is a common paradigm.

I'll take care of this update.

I just checked the complete API. There is no single validation class within Zend\_Validate which supports context.

Looking at the code within Zend\_Form (which calls isValid of the validator with 2 params) I have the feeling that Zend\_Form uses a notation which is actually not supported by Zend\_Validate.

This should also be checked as it could be the reason for this confusion.

There are no validators within Zend\_Validate that _need_ a context, but that does not mean that they cannot support it. isValid() simply requires one argument, a value to validate; extending classes may require additional arguments, provided they are marked as optional (i.e., they have a default value). Zend\_Form's use of a $context parameter makes use of this -- and it _is_ fully tested.

The documentation I plan to add is to show how patterns of validating against data sets or additional values, as, as noted, it's a common paradigm, and supported by PHP's definitions of interfaces and methods, but not explicitly defined within the component.

I think there is a related issue here. The example cited by Matt shows the custom validator extending Zend\_Validate\_Abstract. Zend\_Validate\_Abstract implements Zend\_Validate\_Interface, which defines the isValid method as having only one argument. Therefore, it is impossible to utilize $context passed from Zend\_Form::isValid while taking advantage of the functionality in Zend\_Validate\_Abstract. Someone trying to will receive an error message like this:

Fatal error: Declaration of Foo\_Validate\_Widget::isValid() must be compatible with that of Zend\_Validate\_Interface::isValid()

I think the solution is to add $context to the isValid definition in Zend\_Validate\_Interface but make it optional for compatibility. Having access to context from the Zend\_Form is very important in my opinion.

You don't get this error, actually.

My understanding is that the Interface defines the minimal set of parameters you have to implement; as long as any additional parameters are declared as optional, you'll be OK. This is borne out by my own testing - my context-dependent isValid code works fine as long as it's declared as isValid($value,$context = null)

I agree that adding $context in the Interface and Abstract would help to disambiguate, though.

You're very correct. I had not thought to try that.

As you say, I think it would help. It would also be nice to get those changes into the PHPDoc so it is clear how this works.

Let me clarify.

When you have an interface definition as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Validator
    {
        public function isValid($value);
    }


You can then define a class that implements it that provides _additional_ arguments _provided_ they are _conditional_. So, for example, the following will _not_ work:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class IsNumeric implements Validator
    {
        public function isValid($value, $strict)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }


But this will:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class IsNumeric implements Validator
    {
        public function isValid($value, $strict = false)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }


This is exactly how the $context parameter is documented -- you indicate a default value, and check for the $context when you do your validations.

We cannot change the interface at this point because it would be a backwards compatibility break -- anybody who has implemented the current interface to write their own validators would now have broken code. However, if you use the technique above, using a conditional second argument, there are no issues.

I am once again closing this issue. It's already well documented.
