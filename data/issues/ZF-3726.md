-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-07-23T12:23:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-11-18T09:17:01.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Set preserve\_keys paramter to TRUE in function array\_reverse, because route name can also contain the numeric values

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /** Find the matching route */
            foreach (array_reverse($this->_routes, true) as $name => $route) {
                if ($params = $route->match($pathInfo)) {
                    $this->_setRequestParams($request, $params);
                    $this->_currentRoute = $name;
                    break;
                }
            }

Patch provided (though it's a very simple solution). I hope this will make it faster to fix the issue.
