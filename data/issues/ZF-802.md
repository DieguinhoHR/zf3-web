### Description

In the current Zend\_Auth design, authentication tokens are stored in the PHP session by default using Zend\_Session. If this behavior is not desired (e.g., a user wishes to store the authentication token elsewhere or using a different approach than Zend\_Session), then the user must disable session storage of authentication tokens explicitly by providing false as the value for the useSession option. This is a tight coupling to Zend\_Session within Zend\_Auth.

Authentication token storage is not otherwise addressed by the current design. If we have a storage interface for the authentication tokens, then various storage mechanisms could be developed by users, and some might even make their way into the framework. Zend\_Auth could then be storage agnostic, and unit testing may be improved by allowing for creation of mock storage objects. This is a bit of an implementation detail and would not need to be known by many users, but those who would store authentication tokens other than via Zend\_Session would certainly benefit from abstracting the storage mechanism.

An example storage interface by [~ralph]:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    interface Zend_Auth_Storage_Interface
    {
        /**
         * has() - Method for checking if a value exists for supplied key
         *
         * @param string $name
         * @return bool
         */
        public function has($name);
        
        
        /**
         * get() - Method for getting a value for supplied key
         *
         * @param string $name
         * @return mixed
         */
        public function get($name);
        
        
        /**
         * set() - Method for setting a name/value pair
         *
         * @param string $name
         * @param mixed $value
         */
        public function set($name, $value);
        
        
        /**
         * remove() - Method for removing a key from storage
         *
         * @param string $name
         */
        public function remove($name);
        
        
    }
