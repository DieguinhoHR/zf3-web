There is already another issue regarding this placed in the tracker (ZF-2436). The reason the current implementation is the way it is is to ensure that when going from HTTP-based apps to CLI-based apps, HTTP header-based methods will not result in the inability to run the application.

That said, we plan to refactor -- but to do so, we would need to break backwards compatibility, which means we need to wait until 2.0.0.
