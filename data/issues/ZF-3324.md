ZF-3324: remember\_me\_seconds in ini file does not change cookie lifetime
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-05-25T17:44:49.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-05-18T07:03:50.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.8.2 (27/May/09)

### Description

When loading Zend\_Session options via an ini file using the Zend\_Session::setOptions() function, the remember\_me\_seconds setting in the ini file does not change the cookie lifetime. Cookie lifetime does change if the programmer calls Zend\_Session::rememberMe().

Zend\_Session::rememberMe() internally calls Zend\_Session::rememberUntil() to set the cookie lifetime. However, Zend\_Session::setOptions() does not call rememberUntil() on the remember\_me\_seconds option and so the cookie lifetime does not get set.

This can be mitigated by using Zend\_Session::rememberMe() for this one option.

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

Actually, this is the desired behavior. The goal of the rememberMe feature is to be able to modify the cookie\_lifetime of an already started session, without destroying the existing session.

So by setting the value of remember\_me\_seconds via an ini value, you are saying that when you call rememberMe(), it will use the value provided by the ini setting.

To be able to change the cookie lifetime for all sessions from when they first start, use the cookie\_lifetime setting:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Session::setOptions(array('cookie_lifetime' => $someLongValue));


In summary the options are: cookie\_lifetime - initial lifetime for all sessions remember\_me\_seconds - the value to chage the lifetime of a cookie to if this feature is opted into (thus, the application called Zend\_Session::rememberMe())

Presumably, by the time you get a screen to present the user with the rememberMe() feature, they have already started the default session in your application.

Make sense?
