### Description

Zend\_Json\_Encoder doesn't allow an object to be repeated, even if this object is in two different locations.

Let's say what I want to encode contains : (1) a list of all my items (2) the currently selected item

=========================

class Item{} $item1 = new Item() ; $item2 = new Item() ; $everything = array() ; $everything['allItems'] = array($item1, $item2) ; $everything['currentItem'] = $item1 ;

$encoded = Zend\_Json\_Encoder::encode($everything);

=========================

The second time $item1 passes in \_encodeObject(), it is seen as "visited" and Zend\_Json\_Encoder throws an exception.

Scheduling for release 0.7.0.

Detecting object recursion is next-to-impossible, due to the fact that an object has no idea what container it is in.

As a result, I introduced a second, optional parameter to Zend\_Json::encode()/Zend\_Json\_Encoder::encode(), $cycleCheck. If true, it attempts to detect recursion as it has been doing, simply checking to see if an object has been serialized before in the current encoding session. Otherwise, the check is skipped. By default, the setting is off.
