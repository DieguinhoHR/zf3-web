### Description

While testing against Zend\_Controller is possible, and you can use the examples in the Zend\_Controller test suite to set things up, it would be useful to have a PHPUnit Test Case extension for testing your controllers. It should:

- have scaffolding for setting up and tearing down the front controller environment, including the ability to introduce your bootstrapping methods
- have test versions of the request and response objects that allow you to send set request headers as well as test response headers
- methods to examine the DOM of the response body, including: \*\* pulling items by specific dom IDs (including testing existence of and counting) \*\* pulling items by css classes (including testing existence of and counting) \*\* pulling items by element type (including testing existence of and counting)
