ZF-7239: Zend\_Translate does not work if both caching and the array adapter are used

### Description

If using Zend\_Translate, the Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Array and caching enabled, only the first translation is actually loaded and used:

Zend\_Translate::setCache(...);

$translate = new Zend\_Translate('array', array("hello" => "Hello"), "en" );

$translate->addTranslation( array("hello" => "Howdy"), "en\_US" );

$translate->setLocale("en\_US"); echo $translate->\_("hello"); // BROKEN, produces "No translation for the language 'en\_US' available." error

$translate->setLocale("en"); echo $translate->\_("hello"); // WORKS, outputs "Hello"

$translate->setLocale("en\_AU"); echo $translate->\_("hello"); // WORKS, outputs "Hello"

This happens because Zend\_Translate->\_addTranslationData generates cache keys using the following expression:

'Zend\_Translate\_' . preg\_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9\_]/', '_', $data) . '_' . $this->toString()

This generates identical keys in the case of the array adapter, because in this case $data is an array. (The other adapters generally provide filenames as $data, which are unique, so this isn't a problem for them.)

One fix is to use md5(json\_encode($data)) in place of preg\_replace(...) in the event that $data is an array.

(I realise that there's very little point in using cache and the array adapter at the same time, but the framework I'm using does Zend\_Translate::setCache(...) before my code runs. In my case the "fix" is to do Zend\_Translate::removeCache().)

Duplicate of already fixed issue. Look into trunk and incubator for a fixed version.

Thanks. Though it looks like the fix has only made it to incubator only for what it's worth--? For future reference, the change to incubator appeared in r16247.

ZF-2400/r16247 is actually blocking all commits for Zend\_Translate.

This new feature changes how things work internally and adds plural support. About 8 issues are fixed within this version.

But it is under code review since 1.May and not accepted for now. We still have to wait until it's accepted.
