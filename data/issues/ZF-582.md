You are getting the error because you have not registered a default logger. When you called registerLogger() with a second argument, 'File' in your case, you told the log handler to register your log under the name 'File.' Had you omitted this argument, the file adapter would be registered as the default logger.

To correct the issue, you need to either omit the second argument to registerLogger() or make a call to Zend\_Log::setDefaultLogger('File')

Personally, I don't think that this is a bug. It is the way the component is designed. If you really want to name your logger, just make the extra call to setDefaultLogger().

Correct code is as follows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Log::registerLogger(new Zend_Log_Adapter_File('data/logs/ecmc.log'),'File');
    Zend_Log::setDefaultLogger('FIle');
    Zend_Log::log('First logging message');

Assign to Bill Karwin for verification that these issues are resolved by the new Zend\_Log redesign.

Resolved as Not An Issue.

The design of having static loggers and default loggers has been eliminated, in favor of an object-oriented design.
