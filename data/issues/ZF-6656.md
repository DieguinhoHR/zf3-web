### Description

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader-resource.html) 30.3.1. Resource autoloader usage

It says that {quote} Within this directory, all code is prefixed with the namespace "My\_". Within the "acls" subdirectory, the component prefix "Acl\_" is added, giving a final class name of "My\_Acl\_Site". Similarly, the "forms" subdirectory maps to "Form\_", giving "My\_Form\_Login". _The "models" subdirectory has no component namespace, giving "My\_User"._ {quote}

The bold sentence is wrong. Any class that is not in a ResourceType directory, cannot be loaded by the Ressource Autoloader

Just found the same issue. Is there a way to get My\_User loaded using Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader\_Resource?
