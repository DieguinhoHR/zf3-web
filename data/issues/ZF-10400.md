### Description

The disk usage for cache contents is very high when site content is very large. Compressing cache content with gzip or with other comression methods will save disk space more than 5-10 times. This will be usefull for sites located in the shared hostings with limited disk space. May be not all backends should support this feature, imho, at least Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File must do it.

This will be solved in ZF2 by plugin structure. Than you can simply add a plugin for compressing/decompressing data for caching.
