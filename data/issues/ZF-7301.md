### Description

With a personal php error trigger, Zend\_Validate\_Ip sends warning:

line: 62 inet\_pton() : Unrecognized address <www.XXX.com> Zend/Validate/Ip.php

This class use @ in order to hide this error, but @ doesn't work with a php error trigger.

First off: When using a validator you should use the correct one... Zend\_Validate\_Hostname validates hostnames, and Zend\_Validate\_Ip only IP adresses.

Additionally, Zend classes must be coded in a strict way. No error or output is allowed in default installations.

When using a custom error handler you define yourself that you want to get all notices even if they are supressed intentionally.

As for the IP validator... there is no way to support IPv6 within ZF without the usage of inet\_pton. We would have to recode inet\_pton ourself which is also not allowed.

Feel free to give us a "usable" solution for this problem when you have one.

In fact, i'm not calling Zend\_Validate\_Ip onto an host but Zend\_Feed\_Atom(my\_host). I understand what you tell, but usable solution may be to check into Zend\_Feed\_Atom validator if an IP or an host was given. So we may patch Zend\_Feed\_Atom and not Zend\_Validate\_Ip.

What do think about this ?

When you give a issue for Ip with a error from Ip without any additionally information I also expect that you are using Ip and not Feed. :-)

A "usable" solution would be to use Zend\_Validate\_Hostname because I don't expect that a user gives his feeds ALWAYS as Ip Adress but surely as Hostname Adress. Additionally Hostname does not call Ip when the given input is no Ip Adress which means that there is no notice thrown.

Feel free to open a new issue for Zend\_Feed. Additionally I would propose that you test your problem against ZF 1.9PR or SVN trunk to see if it was already fixed in past.
