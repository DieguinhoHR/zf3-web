### Description

It is not possible to increment/decrement values in steps less than 1 in a dojo numberspinner.

The setSmallDelta method from Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_NumberSpinner currently takes as parameter an int value for delta, which is causing this mis-behaviour. Hence specifying any decimal value will be casted to int.

Also setting smallDelta to a decimal value in an options array to be used in setOptions method doesn't work (i assume the options is somehow translated to a setSmallDelta call)

Current workaround is to set the dijit parameter explicitly like this: $formelement->setDijitParam('smallDelta', 0.01);

Trivial correction is to change the setSmallDelta parameter type from int to float.

Patch and tests for this issue. Can set small and large deltas to decimal values and min and max values to decimal.
