### Description

hi, i have a problem with Zend\_Search\_Lucene

//this is my indexing code.

require('zend.php');

Zend::loadClass('Zend\_Search\_Lucene');

$index = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene('/Inetpub/wwwroot/aa', true);

$doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document();

// Store document URL to identify it in search result.

$q = $db->query("select \* from products");

while($r = $db->fetch($q)) {

$doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field Text('products\_name', $r['products\_name']));

$doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field UnStored('cont ents', $r['products\_description']));

 
    $index->addDocument($doc);


}

$index->commit();

i'm using Text for my product name, and the Text fields are stored, indexed, and tokenized. It is said tokenized, but when i search the word in the products\_name, but it is not searchable. i can only search single word is in the contents field.

anyone know why? example

$doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Text('products\_name', 'this is products a'));

$doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::UnStored('contents', 'description xxxxx xxx 1 2 3));

when i search 'this product', the search can't find anything, but if i search 'xxx 1' it hits the result.

 
    $index = new Zend_Search_Lucene('/Inetpub/wwwroot/aa');
    
    $hits = $index->find('products a'); foreach ($hits as $hit) {
    
    echo $hit->score;
    
    echo '<br>';
    
    echo $hit->products_name;
    
    echo '<br>';
    
    }


thank.

The 'contents' field is the default field to be searched, so you have to add the 'products\_name' field - unfortunately I couldn't find out to do this, the methods seem to be missing...

you'll almost certainly also come across the bug I opened (ZF85) on underscores in field names too. So maybe I'm NOT the only person in the world using fields with underscores in!

Without a method of setting the default contents field ( does this need to be a feature request - I would have thought it would be on the roadmap anyway? ) we re-implemented the Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query class based on the code in there, but with the ability to build the query based on a default field passed in ( to switch between searching in two different languages ). Something like this would remove the need for you to have to keep specifying which field to search in.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

Done with new query parser and Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Query::rewrite() functionality.
