### Description

IÂ´m working with last version 1.8.4 downloaded from zip file, I took and modified the example from online docs, can you clarify me how to workaround it or where is my error

$select = $equipo\_slots->select(Zend\_Db\_Table::SELECT\_WITH\_FROM\_PART)->setIntegrityCheck(false); $select->where('e\_id = ?', $id)  
 ->join('selects','selects.sl\_codigochar = sysacc\_equipo\_slot.es\_status','sl\_descripcion')  
 ->where('selects.sl\_select = ?', 'ESTADOSLOT'); $rows = $equipo\_slots->fetchAll($select);

Error:

Error : Undefined class constant 'SELECT\_WITH\_FROM\_PART'

Since this a new feature committed during the 1.8 branch, its only available in trunk until 1.9 comes out. New features are implemented in minor release points.

Documentation on the other hand, is always built off trunk, which might be the cause for confusion.
