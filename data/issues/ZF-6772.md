### Description

Hi, because Matthew Weier O'Phinney marked ZF-6512 as "Not an Issue", i created this new one. I think ZF team should talk a bit more with the reporters of the issues before marking them as "Not an Issue". The question is: we can use setMessage() to do what i want, but i'm just requesting something that will be a lot useful for everyone. So, we can use the actual validators' messages like id in our translation scheme. What i suggest is like the following example shows:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $min = 0;
    $max = 10000.10;
    $numberValidator = new Zend_Validate_Between(0, $min, $max);
    $numberValidator->setValueDescription($translate->translate('Number')); // Or just 'Number', if translator is passed to validator
    $numberValidator->setLocale($locale); // It will be used to show formated min and max in the messages
    if (!$numberValidator ->isValid(11000)) { 
       echo $messages[Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN]; // "Number' is not between '0' and '10,000.10', inclusively"
    }


As you can see, the message '"Number' is not between '0' and '10,000.10', inclusively"' is just a well presented form of "'11000' is not between '0' and '10000,10', inclusively" In addition, i can use the standard message "'%value%' is not between '%min%' and '%max%', inclusively" as the id in my translation scheme and translate it to "'%value%' must be between '%min%' and '%max%', inclusively" if i want, for example. I think it's easy to implement and will be a lot useful! Why use setMessage() all the times when we can simplify? Using setMessage() will be like this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $min = 0;
    $max = 10000.10;
    $numberValidator = new Zend_Validate_Between(0, $min, $max);
    $numberValidator->setMessage("'%field%' is not between '%formatedMin%' and '%formatedMax%'!", Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN);
    if (!$numberValidator ->isValid(11000)) { 
         $messages = $numberValidator->getMessages(); 
         $messages[Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN] = str_replace(array('%field%', '%formatedMin%', '%formatedMax%'),
                array($translate->translate('Number'), $min, Zend_Locale_Format::toNumber($max, array('locale'=>$locale, 'precision'=>2))),
               $messages[Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN]); 
          echo $messages[Zend_Validate_Between::NOT_BETWEEN]) 
    }


PS: please, don't close this without discussion.

As Matthew commented in the other issue, this is already possible with the setMessages() method.

I'm closing this one solely because it's a duplicate. If you feel it needs to be discussed more, please reopen ZF-6512 instead of adding new issues.

Did you read the explanations?? Maybe not... Forget setMessages() for this case. We could have a easier way to solve this simple cases. Improvements are improvements, ain't? If you are suggesting something that i can't see using setMessages(), please, post an example.

PS: I can't find the link to reopen a issue. How could i do that?

I reopened the original issue. Please continue there.

Ok, thanks! But how could we reopen issues? So we can avoid to create new issues.
