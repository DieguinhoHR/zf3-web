### Description

It is relative to rev:18604 Please add Zend\_Application::resetResoruce() and exec it in Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase::reset()

For example, Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase::bootstrap() resets the frontcontroller by resetInstance() and gets the frontcontroller same instance from Zend\_Application. But it cannot be initialized by Zend\_Application::bootstrap() because the bootstrap has it statically. As a result the frontcontroller instance is not designed but is a plain instance.

If all the Zend\_Application's Resources are also reset in the Zend\_Test\_PHPUnit\_ControllerTestCase::reset(), that

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_frontController = $this->bootstrap->getBootstrap()->getResource('frontcontroller');


will be return the just designed instance.

This should now be resolved in trunk.
