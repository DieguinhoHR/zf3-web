ZF-12425: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname doesn't handle ccTLD .рф
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

This is valid TLD and domain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.%D1%80%D1%84> but Zend\_Validate\_Hostname doesn't handle it well.

$zvh = new Zend\_Validate\_Hostname; if (!$zvh->isValid('президент.рф')) { foreach ($zvh->getMessages() as $m) { echo $m,PHP\_EOL; } }

'президент.рф' appears to be a DNS hostname but cannot match TLD against known list 'президент.рф' does not appear to be a valid local network name
