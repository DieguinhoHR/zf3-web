### Description

I've written a DbTable adapter that subclasses from Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable, overloading only the authenticate() method. This is standard fare, of course, but I had to duplicate a lot of code within that overload in order to sub it. It would be wonderful to have the authenticate() method split into finer-grained protected methods such as:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _validate # Zend_Auth_Adapter_Exception
    protected function _buildAuthResult() # array, or an instance of a new data transfer class?
    protected function _sanitizeCredentialTreatment($treatment = "?") # string
    protected function _buildCredentialExpression() # Zend_Db_Expr
    protected function _buildSelect() # Zend_Db_Select
    protected function _doSelect($dbSelect) # array or rowset OR throw Zend_Auth_Adapter_Exception
    protected function _validateIdentities($resultIdentities = array()) # Zend_Auth_Result


I will submit a patch as soon as my CLA is faxed and approved, but I thought I'd open dialogue now.

This would make subclassing a lot cleaner and less brittle as Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_DbTable grows.

I like this idea... Ralph, what do you think?

I like this idea too actually, I think overall we can reduce the authenticate to perhaps 4 sub protected methods, (a lower number would also reduce the number of class properties we'd need to add to maintain state from protected method to protected method)
