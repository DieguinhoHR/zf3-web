ZF-8079: Incorrect use of timeout in Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl

### Description

When the Curl adapter creates the curl handle it translates the Zend\_Http\_Client timeout setting into CURLOPT\_TIMEOUT. This causes problems when using the adapter for file uploads. The Curl adapter should translate the timeout into CURLOPT\_CONNECTTIMEOUT as this is the more compatible setting to how the timeout is used in other adapters.

Here is a patch which fixes the issue:

Hi, Lee. I agree as 2nd change. Because the following method is used in connect() function for setting connection parameters.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    curl_setopt($this->_curl, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, $this->_config['timeout']);


But, It is hard to understand for me to change $\_invalidOverwritableCurlOptions definition. Because this array is used in write() function for setting additional curl options in curl execution.

Do you have any idea?

It seems that we do want to prevent people from attempting to change the connect timeout setting as that has already been used. However, the timeout setting might be something people will change after the adapter has been constructed. This will allow people to set a timeout for a specific call and then change it again for another call.

I see, now You can set CURLOPT\_CONNECTIONTIMEOUT in the write() instead of the CURLOPT\_TIMEOUT if you would want, but it seems to be slightly strange. :-(

So, I will change $\_invalidOverwritableCurlOptions so you can set CURLOPT\_TIMEOUT in the write().
