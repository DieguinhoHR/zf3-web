### Description

When the server recieves a POST or PUT request with no body, it will hang forever, waiting for additional content (which will not come).

Generally speaking, you should always inspect the Content-length header to check how many bytes need to be read to get the body of the request. If Content-length is 0 or the header is not present, there is no body and you should not try to read it.

I think the problem is in Request.php line 178.
