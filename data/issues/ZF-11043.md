### Description

Sometimes you need the form to be printed or forwarded. This can be direct by the printer or an email f.x.

But there you don't need the whole form elements anymore, only the labels and the value which is set to the form elements.

So my suggestion is a method, that don't render the form with the whole , , ,...elements. Only one HTML tag is used for the label and the value (for formatting).

How it could look like (tags from "default" zend form settings):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Method: echo $form->renderPrinted();


    Title
    
    Title
    myTitleValueFromForm
    
    Text
    test text...
    
    ...

Your HTML-Code is wrong and why is this a major issue?

Compare with: [HTML\_QuickForm::freeze()](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.html.html-quickform.html-quickform.freeze.php)

A simple workaround: Use the standard decorators ViewScript or Callback.

Priority changed.

What is wrong with the HTML-Code? :-) It's an extract and not the complete HTML.

The type is not an issue, it's submitted as an improvement. But you are right with the priority.

Yes, "HTML\_QuickForm::freeze()" is exactly what this method should do.

Hi Martin, look here:

 
    <pre class="highlight">


``I think, this issue depends on ZF-10205

That issue is similar, but exactly the same.

When you want to send the form as an information e-mail, the form part (input, select, ...) are still in the source? If i understood that solution correct.

That HTML part was generated with Zend\_Form. When this form is wrong, there is maybe an issue.

To "freeze" a form, you need a element-decorator which produces plain text.

    <pre class="highlight">

I changed my Zend\_Form abstraction class last week, and could change it to valid html.
