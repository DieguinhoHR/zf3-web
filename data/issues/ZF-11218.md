### Description

Zend\\CodeGenerator\\Php\\PhpFile in ZF2 allows you to define use statements (with aliases, even!) with "setUse()" and "setUses()". However, when generating the actual file, these values are never used.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $file = new PhpFile();
    $file->setUse("Foo\Bar\Baz");
    echo $file->generate();


I'd expect the output to contain:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    use Foo\Bar\Baz;


However, no such line occurs.

A fix for this, and generation of a file-level namespace declaration, are in ZF2 git master.
