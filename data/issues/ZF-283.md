ZF-283: 'Illegal Token' on decoding arrays with a blank or linebreak before right bracket
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Decoding a JSON-string like the following works fine. But if you put a blank or a linebreak before the right bracket you get an "Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Json\_Exception' with message 'Illegal Token'" However, putting a tab before the right bracket seems to be ok.

$json = '{ "data" : [ 1, 2, 3, 4] }'; $decoded = Zend\_Json::decode($json);

Wrote new tests in 1434 to check the report; tests pass, so unable to confirm.
