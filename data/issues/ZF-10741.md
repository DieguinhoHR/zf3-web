Patch adds unit tests to Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Smtp, with a small refactoring of calls to PHP stream functions in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract to allow mocking of the protocol adapter for testing.

Applied to trunk in r23475, merged to release branch 1.11 in r23476. Leaving open for now to remind myself to add these tests to ZF2.
