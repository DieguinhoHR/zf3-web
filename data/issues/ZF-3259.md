### Description

After numerous attempts I have yet to succeed in using Zend\_XmlRpc Client & Server. There seems to be something wrong with introspection. Creating a simple example with one call that takes 1 argument yields parameters do not match signature. I believe the actual error is generated by Zend\_XmlRpc\_Server, but client could be building the request incorrectly.

Forgot the error text:

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client\_FaultException' with message 'Calling parameters do not match signature' in /Library/WebServer/Documents/zend\_rest/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php:289 Stack trace: #0 /Library/WebServer/Documents/zend\_service/index.php(5): Zend\_XmlRpc\_Client->call('sayHello', Array) #1 {main} thrown in /Library/WebServer/Documents/zend\_rest/Zend/XmlRpc/Client.php on line 289

1) You need to specify phpdoc style comments to methods, otherwise the server's introspection can't figure out what should be returned...

2) When specifying the phpdoc stuff, CASE MATTERS...

e.g.

/\*\* \* @param string whatever \* @return array blah blah \*/ function myExample($x) { // .... }

(Zend\_XmlRpc works for me)

Please evaluate and fix/categorize as necessary.

i had similar behavior experienced, first as i base64\_(de|en)code my string which is containing image data then it works properly.

As others pointed out, adding the doc comments fixes your issue.
