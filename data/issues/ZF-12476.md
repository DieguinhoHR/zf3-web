### Description

I have used the following tutorial to implement a ZF2 in console line:[http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/…](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/modules/zend.console.routes.html#value-flag-parameters)

The example give the following configuration for the route:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    'find-user' => array(
        'options' => array(
            'route'    => 'find user [--id=] [--firstName=] [--lastName=] [--email=] [--position=] ',
            'defaults' => array(
                'controller' => 'Application\Controller\Users',
                'action'     => 'find'
            )
        )
    )


Althought, when tested, it seems that the route does not support uppercase character inside any of the parameter. In the example: --firstName is not recognize when typing the command line: \* php public/index.php find user --firstName=test Also, the system seem's to require lowercase for the first character to any parameter given ('Find' cannot be defined in the route as it will state a message of being unable to understand the route).

Either it is a bug or a missing information in the documentation :-)
