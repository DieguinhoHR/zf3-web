### Description

When I try to serialize an instance of Zend\_DB with a PDO adapter, I'm getting the following error: bq.Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'You cannot serialize or unserialize PDO instances' This can be solved by adding a few lines of code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Serializable_PDO extends PDO implements Serializable {
        public function serialize(){
            return serialize($this);
        }
    
        public function unserialize($serialized){
            return unserialize($serialized);
        }  
    }


And on line 111 of Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     /*
    $this->_connection = new PDO(
                    $dsn,
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    $this->_config['driver_options']
                );
    */
     $this->_connection = new Serializable_PDO(
                    $dsn,
                    $this->_config['username'],
                    $this->_config['password'],
                    $this->_config['driver_options']
                );


I know that the unserialized object won't be valid, but you don't get any fatal errors anymore if you want to save for example a serialized part of the backtrace in your error\_handler.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This breaks expected usage with the core PHP classes and therefore is not suitable for inclusion within the framework. There is scope, of course, for you to create your own DB class and specify that instead of the default ZF adapter.
