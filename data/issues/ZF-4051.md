### Description

The default XML context used by the ContextSwitch action helper sets the Content-Type header to a value of text/xml, which is being deprecated in favor of application/xml. This change is already visible in applications such as Firefox 3. See [http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/â€¦](http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200407/msg00208.html) for more details.
