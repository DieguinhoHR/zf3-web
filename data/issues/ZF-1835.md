### Description

I believe this fix should be reconsidered -- it removes support for non-lower case paths which appears to be contrary to other Zend Framework standards.

Zend\_View throws exception when trying to auto-render any camelCased action:

{quote}Uncaught exception 'Zend\_View\_Exception' with message 'script 'controller/camelcasedaction.phtml' not found in path [...]{quote}

Line 718 of Zend/Controller/Action/Helper/ViewRenderer.php:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    should be changed to:

The behaviour outlined is intended. Not all filesystems use the same rules regarding case (some are case sensitive and others are not). Normalization of the names ensures that view scripts will always be found, so long as you follow the rules.

In the 1.5 release, there will be further ability to modify the rules used to resolve view scripts via the inflector attached to the ViewRenderer. You can either replace the inflector with your own, or replace the rules on the given inflector. This allows you to disable the StringToLower cast that currently exists if you so desire, and can be done in an early running plugin so as to affect your entire site.
