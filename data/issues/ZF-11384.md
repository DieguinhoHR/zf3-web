### Description

When commenting lines in yaml-config, comments can be started only from 0-position of string, to be processed correctly (to be ignored). Otherwise, by yaml-specification, comment can be started from any position of string, and text after comment should be ignored.

The patch is only replace {quote} if ($line[0] == '#') { // comment continue; } {quote} in Zend\_Config\_Yaml to {quote} $line = rtrim(preg\_replace("/#.\*$/", "", $line)); {quote}

YAML specification indicates that comments can indeed be indented (see <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2780069>, Example 6.10). I've committed a fix and unit test to resolve this issue in r24090 and r24091
