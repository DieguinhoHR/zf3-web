### Description

PHP's SoapClient and SoapServer have an option called "features", which is currently not supported. Zend\_Soap\_Server ignores the option, and Zend\_Soap\_Client throws an Exception.

The situation for cache\_wsdl is similar, although there's a php.ini setting to work around the problem.

Added setter and getter functions for both 'features' and 'cache\_wsdl' of the Zend\_Soap\_Server
