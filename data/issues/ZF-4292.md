### Description

One improvment of the Zend\_Form module could be that when we used a Zend\_Form, simply using the class Zend\_Dojo\_Form would add the nice dojo features, like client side validation for exemple.

Extending Zend\_Dojo\_Form is the recommended use case; you can also use Zend\_Dojo\_Form just as you can Zend\_Form.
