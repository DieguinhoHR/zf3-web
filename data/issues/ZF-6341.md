### Description

It would be useful if when creating a project, public/index.php should add library/ to the include\_path. This would mean that the require\_once 'Zend/Application.php'; call would work...

set\_include\_path() adding library/ to include\_path within index.php has been added to trunk and merged to 1.8 release branch.

Tested and works for me.

Should we remove the line:

includePaths.library = APPLICATION\_PATH "/../library"

from the generated application.ini?
