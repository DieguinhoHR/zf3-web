### Description

The structure of the Zend\_Config wiki documentation does not match that of the DocBook documentation for it. The structure should be:

The current structure in the wiki is:

Zend\_Config Theory of Operation Zend\_Config\_Array Zend\_Config\_Ini Zend\_Config\_Xml

From Gavin: Introduction: It is not on a separate page in the wiki, but is grouped with the table of contents pages for each component. I suggest we alter the docbook to resemble the wiki, by including the "introduction" sections below the table of contents, on the same page. Most seem to prefer this style, and I think it improves readability.

Updating to comply with new IT component conventions.
