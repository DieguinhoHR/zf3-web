### Description

If you pass a properly folded mail header to Zend\_Mail::addHeader(), it strips all CRLF when it calls \_filterOther(). It \*sometimes\* encodes the header value (as either QP or Base64), but only if it contains non-printable characters. So there's a case where you have a long, but properly-folded header, with no special characters, but when you add it to your Zend\_Mail and send, it throws an exception, because after stripping all the CRLF, the header (now a single line) is > 998 chars.

Code to reproduce:

 <?php require\_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php'; Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::getInstance(); $mail = new Zend\_Mail(); $foldedHeader = implode("\\r\\n ", array\_fill(0, 100, "a line that is not, by itself, too long")); $mail->addHeader('X-Folded-Header-Test', $foldedHeader); $mail->setFrom('sender@example.com') ->addTo('recipient@example.com') ->setSubject('Folded header test') ->setBodyText('This will throw a long header exception'); $mail->send(); ?> For me, this became an issue because I'm using SendGrid's SMTP API, which accepts a special header containing parameters in JSON format, which can get quite long and needs to be folded -- but then Zend\_Mail UNfolds it.

There are a number of temporary workarounds possible by subclassing Zend\_Mail, but it seems that if it really needs to strip the CRLF (I assume there's a good reason), then \_encodeHeader() should look at the header length, and \*always\* encode long values, even if they don't contain non-printable characters. At least, this was the response I got from my question here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8719322/â€¦](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8719322/cant-understand-why-zend-mailaddheader-strips-newlines)
