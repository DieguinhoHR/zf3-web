### Description

When creating custom Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider(s) with the ProjectProvider create action the provider skeletons get generated correct in naming except for reported <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-7139> issue.

When the project and it's providers are in the include\_path and 'zf --help' is called the first character of these generated providers are not visible. I generate overall three providers(Json, Xml, Yaml) and they are shown in the help the following way:

 
    <pre class="literal">...
      son
        zf import son
        zf export son
    
      ml
        zf import ml
        zf export ml
    
      aml
        zf import aml
        zf export aml
    ...

The funny thing is that this isn't just an issue of a maybe faulty help message shown to the client consumer; no the providers have to be actually called the way they are shown in the help.

When calling the Yaml provider 'zf import yaml' the Zend\_Tool CLI issues the following error message:

 
    <pre class="literal">An Error Has Occurred                            
    Provider 'yaml' is not a valid provider.

When calling the Yaml provider 'zf import aml' the Zend\_Tool CLI runs the import action.
