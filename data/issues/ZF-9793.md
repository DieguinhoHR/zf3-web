ZF-9793: Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File missing getOption()

### Description

Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_File is missing the getOption method, which is present in other backends (like Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Static), as well as Zend\_Cache\_Core. This method is useful to retrieve things like the cache\_dir for the specific backend instance.

I've attached a patch.

It might be better to add this to the Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface and make this a method in every backend. I'd be happy to implement this if this is desired.

Why is getOption() returning a merged array of all options when the $name parameter is not a string ? Seems to me if you want all options, there should be a method called getAllOptions(), which is more consistent with things like Zend\_Controller's \_getParam() and \_getAllParams() Also, unless I'm missing something, why is the default of $name set to array() if the first line is a type check which, if it fails, reverts to an array of all options being returned, regardless of the content of $name ?

It looks like this bug was commited only to git (zf2). I'll merge it this week back to svn (zf1).

fixed in r24988 (trunk) & r24989 (1.12 branch)

NOTE: getOption throws an exception on an unknown option name and doesn't return all options on an empty option name.
