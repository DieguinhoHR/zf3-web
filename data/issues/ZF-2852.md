not sure who assigned this to Wil, but I just removed the assignment because as far as I can see in the Change History it must have been me... no Idea how & why :D

Added in trunk and 1.5 release branch

I'm assuming this fix is merged to the 1.5 release branch for release with 1.5.1. Please update JIRA if this is not the case.
