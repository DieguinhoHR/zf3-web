### Description

The Zend\_Rest\_Server have two functions for the default management of return vales (\_handleStruct and \_handleScalar) but the functions had hardcoded the encoding of the DomDocument (UTF-8), this issue can be resolved with a simple propiety (var $\_encoding) and simple access methods (maybe getResponseEncoding and setResponseEncoding).

It's my first report, so, I don't know how works the community and who say what user resolve the issue, but if it is no problem i can send a patch.

Tentatively scheduling for 1.1.0

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.
