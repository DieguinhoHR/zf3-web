ZF-8104: Going through a proxy results in a wrong HTTP request being sent.

### Description

I am talking about: Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Proxy.php @ around line 148

{quote} // Build request headers if ($this->negotiated) { $path = $uri->getPath(); if ($uri->getQuery()) { $path .= '?' . $uri->getQuery(); } $request = "$method $path HTTP/$http\_ver\\r\\n"; } else { $request = "$method $uri HTTP/$http\_ver\\r\\n"; } {/quote}

And especially about the 2nd line with "$method $uri HTTP/$http\_ver\\r\\n";

This is crucial because I receive this request: bq."GET Object id #24 HTTP/1.1"

_Solution:_ This can be easily solved by adding a \_\_toString() function in the URI object.

Grtz, Steven

I cant reproduce that, sorry.

Zend\_Uri\_Http actually has a \_\_toString() method which gets used.

Additionally, in case no \_\_toString() method is written, PHP sends a Fatal Error. If you see "Object id #xx", then I assume you are using PHP5.1 which is too old and not supported anymore by ZF

Unsupported PHP version (reopen if proven otherwise)
