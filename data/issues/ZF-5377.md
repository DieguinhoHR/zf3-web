### Description

The hostname used to access the Google Apps API feeds has changed from <www.google.com> to apps-apis.google.com. The Zend\_Gdata\_Gapps classes and associated tests need to be updated to use this when constructing URLs.

Since <www.google.com> continues serve API requests, existing client versions will continue to work. As a result, this issue is not urgent.
