### Description

Sometimes I need to know if a select instance is in an empty state (just initialized or fully resetted).

Since the select class is hardcoded in the Adapters, I can't implement this method for myself, so I need to do this check:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $select = Zend_Db_Table::getDefaultAdapter()->select();
    
    $select->from()
       ...
       ...;
    
    $selectString = $select->__toString();
    if (empty($selectString)) {
        // empty state
    }


My proposal is for a method isEmpty() (or any better name), that could do this check, maybe comparing the $\_parts and $\_partsInit properties.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    public function isEmpty()
    {
        return self::$_partsInit === $this->_parts;
    }
