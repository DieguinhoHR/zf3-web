Confirmed. I will work on this soon.

On further investigation, the problem is that the only place a query is recorded by the Profiler is in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query(). This means that if one were to instantiate a Statement object and call execute() on it as a separate step instead of using query(), then no Profiler data is recorded. This pattern of calling the Statement is typical usage when using prepared queries.

Fixed in revision 5401.

Note that executing a prepared query multiple times creates multiple entries in the array of query profiles, each with its own array of values for any query parameters used in a given execution of the query.
