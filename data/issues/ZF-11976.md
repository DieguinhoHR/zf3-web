### Description

Hello ZF team. First of all thank you for your work. There is strange behavior with one of the cache function (Zend\_Cache\_Core::setBackend). It uses Zend\_Cache\_Backend as parameter, but more logical if it use Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Interface instead.

Downgrading to Minor, as all backends extend Zend\_Cache\_Backend at this point. There really isn't any gain that I can see in changing this now, and there is the possibility that people out there may have created custom backends that extend Zend\_Cache\_Backend but don't implement the interface and so those would no longer be accepted by Zend\_Cache\_Core. It may be worth making a note in the manual about needing to extend Zend\_Cache\_Backend if you're creating a new custom backend, though
