### Description

For example, calling <http://localhost/register/error> will give the following error

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Exception' with message 'RegisterController::errorAction() does not exist and was not trapped in \_\_call().' in c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Action.php:92 Stack trace: #0 c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Action.php(114): Zend\_Controller\_Action->\_\_call('errorAction', Array) #1 c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Dispatcher.php(185): Zend\_Controller\_Action->run(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher), Object(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Token)) #2 c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Dispatcher.php(136): Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher->\_dispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Token), true) #3 c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Front.php(254): Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher->dispatch(Object(Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Token)) #4 c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Front.php(106): Zend\_Controller\_Front->dispatch() #5 C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache2\\htdocs\\index.php(15): Zend\_Controller\_Front::run('application/con...') #6 {main} thrown in c:\\php\\includes\\Zend\\Controller\\Action.php on line 92

Hi, do you use noRouteAction()? Try with \_\_call($action, $arguments) function. I'm not sure that's the correct solution but it works for me. I don't know when we must use \_\_call() or noRouteAction(). Moreover.. do you use this patch ( [http://zend.com/lists/fw-general/â€¦](http://www.zend.com/lists/fw-general/200604/msg00584.html) )?

Seems that noRouteAction() works only in IndexController.

This behaviour works entirely differently in the current incubator version (release 0.2.0). Basically, the dispatcher now checks to see if the requested action exists in the controller; if not, it uses a default action ('index' by default, but it may be registered with the dispatcher). The only time the exception reported by the OP will be reported is if the default action is not present in the controller, which is a highly exceptional situation.

Resolved in the 0.2.0 incubator version of the MVC implementation
