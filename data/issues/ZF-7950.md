### Description

When i tried create a module bootstrap, using the "resources.modules[] =" line, i got the error message: "Fatal error: Call to a member function getControllerDirectory() on a non-object in C:\\Arquivos de programas\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Application\\Resource\\Modules.php on line 63". Looking more deep inside Modules.php file in line 63 $front = $bootstrap->getResource('FrontController'); $front is null

George, The error means you haven't initialized a front controller either by your own means or through Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller.

Please see: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.available-resources.html#zend.application.available-resources.frontcontroller)

Please let me know if this fixes the issue for you.

On a side note: This should be patched to throw an exception instead with a missing front controller instance. This should to apply to any Zend\_Application\_Resource\_\* though.

Thank you so much by help me

I edited my code, puting the folow code lines:

public function \_initFrontController(){  
 $this->\_frontController = new Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller(); $this->\_frontController->init(); $this->\_controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $this->\_controller->addModuleDirectory(APPLICATION\_PATH . '/modules'); return $this->\_frontController; }

on my Bootstrap class. But now i got the error message: Call to undefined method Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller::getControllerDirectory() in C:\\Arquivos de programas\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Application\\Resource\\Modules.php on line 65

Is it my fault ?

Yes.

Just kidding :)

You don't actually use the new Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller directly. It is there to provide you an easy way to setup your front controller so you don't have to write a \_initFrontController method.

Please take a look at the section titled "Example 4.2. Sample Front Controller resource configuration" in the link I provided above. It should cover the configuration you need. Remove your \_initFrontControlller method and use the configuration instead as it sets up Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Frontcontroller for you. Hope that helps. I am resolving this ticket, but feel free to comment if you need additional help.
