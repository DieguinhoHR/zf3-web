ZF-3205: DisplayGroups are only rendered when FormElements decorator is used, which causes elements existent in displayGroups to render twice

### Description

When using displayGroups, elements used in displayGroups are rendered twice when $form->render() is called.

If you do not want to render each displayGroup by hand but render the form as a whole, then this goes wrong, because displayGroups only get rendered via FormElements decorator. So an element gets first rendered in a displayGroup and after that displayGroup is rendered, the element gets rendered on itself. This is no good behaviour.

I suppose that an element is cleared from the form->\_elements array after a displayGroup rendered it. As a workaround, I made a displayGroup decorator who only renders displayGroups and no other elements. This applies only to my current situation of course.

I cannot reproduce the issue, and in fact have tests that prove the opposite.

You may re-open the issue if you can provide a succinct reproduce case for me.

Bookkeeping. Trying to assign all issues that are resolved to the people who resolved them. The only unassigned issues should be new, unreviewed ones.
