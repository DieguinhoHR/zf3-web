ZF-3959: Add hint about Apache's AllowEncodedSlashes to documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend Framework by default uses URL paths to encode module/controller/action/parameters. Good!

Parameters values are urlencoded by default ("?" => "%3f", "/" => "%2f", etc.). Good!

Apache by default disallows encoded slashes (%2f) in URL path parts and issues a "fake" 404 not found message, even when using mod\_rewrite and everything is set up correctly. BAD!

This "feature" can be disabled using the "AllowEncodedSlashes On" directive, but unfortunately it has to be done on a server-wide or virtualhost level.

I'm surprised that this hasn't been included in documentation as it affects anyone using the default ZF router and a default Apache install who tries to pass slashes via GET.

Matthew, should this be added to the ref guide?

I really have no idea where in the manual this would belong; I'm thinking this makes a better FAQ item than anything.

Added to FAQ

Perhaps here: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html)

It does affect anyone using the standard router with the default routes and the rewrite rules written on that page.

Clarification: it affects those who are using url path parameters that include slashes -- which is something of an edge case, and something I'd likely advise not doing, as it makes it unclear what parameter/value pairs are present.

I think the FAQ note is sufficient here.
