ZF-5433: Easier syntax for Zend\_Form xml templates with duplicate decorators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently to specify duplicate decorators on an xml file, you have to do the following

 
    <pre class="literal">ViewHelperdivHtmlTagdivHtmlTagdiv

I purpose this syntax

 
    <pre class="literal"> ViewHelperdivHtmlTagdivHtmlTagdiv

It's clearer and more intuitive. The first time i tried this but then playing with the form i realized the functional way to do this.
