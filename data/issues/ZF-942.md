### Description

In PgSql::lastInsertId, the primary key part of the sequence name has been dropped in 0.8.0:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sequenceName = $tableName . '_seq';
    return $this->_connection->lastInsertId($sequenceName);


as opposed to that in 0.7.0:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return $this->_connection->lastInsertId($tableName .'_'. $primaryKey .'_seq');


causing an error like:

_PDOException: SQLSTATE[42P01]: Undefined table: 7 ERROR: relation "element\_seq" does not exist in_

where the actual sequence name is 'element\_id\_seq', created automatically with the serial type. Changing back to

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $sequenceName = $tableName . '_' . $primaryKey . '_seq';


seems to work.

Is there any reason for dropping the primary key part?

This bug is really breaking my code. Even if you don't use my patch, please fix it; it's only one line of code! :)
