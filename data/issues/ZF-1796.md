### Description

The current code in the mysqli driver assumes that the Mysqli class is available. If it is not (extension not installed) an exception is not thrown, and the @ makes the error hid from the normal output. We are left with a blank screen.

The code should test for the presence of the mysqli class and raise an exception if it is not known.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // Suppress connection warnings here.
            // Throw an exception instead.
            @$this->_connection = new mysqli(
                $this->_config['host'],
                $this->_config['username'],
                $this->_config['password'],
                $this->_config['dbname'],
                $port
            );


Should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
            if(!class_exists("mysqli"))
            {
                /**
                 * @see Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli_Exception
                 */
                require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Mysqli/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Db_Adapter_Mysqli_Exception("The extension mysqli is not installed.");
            }
        
            // Suppress connection warnings here.
            // Throw an exception instead.
            @$this->_connection = new mysqli(
                $this->_config['host'],
                $this->_config['username'],
                $this->_config['password'],
                $this->_config['dbname'],
                $port
            );
