ZF-6974 explains the problem with more details
==============================================

ZF-6974 is marked as resolved, but this issue is still presenting in the trunk for me.

I'm getting this too.

The problem occurs because Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::getPluginResourceNames() calls Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::getPluginResources() which in turn calls Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::\_loadPluginResource(). This instantiates but does not execute instances of the registered resource objects, causing Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session::setSaveHandler() to instantiate an instance of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract before the Db resource is actually executed. Since Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db doesn't call Zend\_Db\_Table::setDefaultAdapter() until it's init() method is called, the desired behavior fails.

The simplest solution seems to be to remove the call to getPluginResources() in Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_BootstrapAbstract::getPluginResourceNames(). This seems to be working for me, but may cause problems, so another solution may be more desirable. In any case, this bug will definitely cause problems with other resources down the line and should be fixed up.

I think it should call bootstrap("db"), if the Db-Savehandler is used, because its a direct dependency and the manual mention, that dependencies should be solved this way. Maybe the savehandler-class call it itself, instead of the session-pluginresource.

I disagree Sebastian. Technically Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session is not dependent on Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db, so I don't think we should force this in the code.

If we wanted to focus the solution within the Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session class, we could think about restructuring things so the save handler instance, in this case an object of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract, isn't created until Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session::init() is called. In fact, I don't see why we can't move all of the logic in Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session::setSaveHandler() to Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session::init().

However, as I noted above, the problem we are encountering is tied to the way resources are setup, loaded, and executed, so it may be best to tackle the underlying logic to prevent future bugs with different resources.

{quote}I disagree Sebastian. Technically Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Session is not dependent on Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db, so I don't think we should force this in the code. {quote} Not the whole resource, but the Db-savehandler.

Yes, but Zend\_Session\_SaveHandler\_DbTable isn't dependent on Zend\_Application\_Resource\_Db either. It's a subclass of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract and must have an instance of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract set as it's adapter, but that adapter doesn't need to be created through an application resource.

Moved SaveHandler initialization from setOptions() to init() method (db should be initialized at this point).

This patch works for me!

Thank you for it.

Applied the patch and wrote a unittest suite for Session resource, merged into 1.9 release branch.
