ZF-6766: Zend\_Filter\_Input doesn't allow to validate arrays
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If validation rule refers only one field (or all fields using wildcard metacommand) and field value is an array, then Zend\_Filter\_Input::\_validateRule() iterates through it and applies validators to an array values.

So, it's not possible to validate arrays.
