As I see it's array\_multisort() call. It has variable length parameter list.

I have tried it with current SVN version and Zend Guard v4.0.1. SegmentInfo.php was encoded without any error. Can you try Zend Guard v4.0.1?

Works with Guard 4.0.1, ZF 0.2

Looks like a Zend Guard bug. Works with Zend Guard 4.0.1
