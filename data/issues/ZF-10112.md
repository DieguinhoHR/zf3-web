----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

in \_doRequest method of Zend\_Feed\_Pubsubhubbub\_Subscriber, the call of $client->setRawData($this->\_getRequestParameters($url, $mode)); without second parameter $enctype reset the enctype to null. (previously set to url encoded by the call of $client->setMethod in \_getHttpClient)

the request must have a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded according to PubSubHubbub specs : [http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/…](http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.3.html#anchor5)

Since you are about to fix this component. Can you fix [this bug](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-10112) too?

Not sure this is correct. A value of NULL for the encoding forces the default to be used which is the correct url encoding. Nevertheless, since custom clients can be passed around in the future, I've made it an explicit setting in r23071 to avoid any confusion.

I had problems subscribing to a PuSHPress-Hub because PHP doesnt set $\_POST parameters if the encoding is not application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Btw, same at Zend\_Feed\_Pubsubhubbub\_Publisher line 414.

Fixed in trunk! :P I Need to look at Zend\_Http\_Client because this should be done by default. Somewhere amid all the null value, the setEncType() call isn't applying it's default value.

Removing fix version. Issues marked 'duplicate' don't need a fix version -- it makes them appear in the JIRA changelog and/or roadmap.
