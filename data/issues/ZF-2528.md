ZF-2528: Zend\_Form \_\_toString() implementations should not throw exceptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Currently, all \_\_toString() implementations in the Zend\_Form classes proxy to render(), which in turn proxies to decorators and potentially other classes -- any of which could throw an exception. PHP doesn't like exceptions in \_\_toString() and throws an E\_FATAL that doesn't accurately depict the root cause of the issue.

To make debugging simpler, \_\_toString() should capture exceptions, and then raise an E\_USER\_WARNING with the exception message.
