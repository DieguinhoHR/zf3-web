### Description

I will wish for an improvement to consider a DbTable for this validator. The DbTable may provide different information like the name, the schema, and the adapter.

The db validator may now take a select object, which can be passed from the table itself.

Being able to pass the table in only adds the question of how best to fit that with selecting the field to use.

Closing as Wont fix, because a satisfactory alternative is already available.
