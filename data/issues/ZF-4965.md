### Description

Yesterday i've started a project, based on blogspot functionality of zend gdata package.

First of all standart example blogger.php is unusable cause it fails to input from user blogid value and since so all functionality missed. method getInput not working when you're trying to run it from console window.

also when i'm trying to set http timeout option

 
    public function __construct($email, $password)
    {
        $client = Zend_Gdata_ClientLogin::getHttpClient($email, $password, 'blogger');
    $client->setConfig(array('timeout'=>1));// here 
        $this->gdClient = new Zend_Gdata($client);
    }


it ignores it even i'm blocking my network by firewall - app hangs awaiting for newtwork stream to be completed.

Dimitry,

Can you provide some more specific details on what exactly is failing for you? I understand that there is some timeout issue? Can you var\_dump the client object and let us know if this affects Zend\_Gdata\_HttpClient or Zend\_Http\_Client?

Thanks - Jochen
