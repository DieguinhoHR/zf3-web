### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setWsdl($wsdl)
        {
            $this->_validateUrn($wsdl);
            $this->_wsdl = $wsdl;
            return $this;
        }


Should be

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function setWsdl($wsdl)
        {
            $this->validateUrn($wsdl); // underscore removed
            $this->_wsdl = $wsdl;
            return $this;
        }

Re-assigned to someone who might actually know what they're reviewing :)
