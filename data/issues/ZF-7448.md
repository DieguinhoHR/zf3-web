### Description

In version 1.8.2, I use Zend\_Translate to load bundle message which aren't specific locale, thus I use the locale 'root', ex :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $zT = new Zend_Translate('ini', $bundleFile, 'root');


This example run well in version 1.8.2 but doesn't run in version 1.9.0. In this version we are this exception throw on line 143 of Zend\_Translate\_Adapter :

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function addTranslation($data, $locale = null, array $options = array())
        {
            try {
                $locale    = Zend_Locale::findLocale($locale);
            } catch (Zend_Locale_Exception $e) {
                require_once 'Zend/Translate/Exception.php';
                throw new Zend_Translate_Exception("The given Language '{$locale}' does not exist");
            }


It's normal to have this comportement ?

'root' is no locale, it's the private placeholder for all datas which are used within all locales, a sort of dictionary. It can not explicitly be set as locale.

This is no bug, it's expected behaviour.
