### Description

On line 1067 in the file Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/Abstract.php the method checks, if the hashing algorithm is present on the system by doing a lookup on "hash\_algos()".

It does this lookup by the array key (a number) and not by its value (which is the name of the hash).

I think this method never works this way. The line should be something like.

 
    <pre class="literal">
    if (!(in_array($hash, $algorithms))) { 


Tell me if I'm wrong.
