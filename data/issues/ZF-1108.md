### Description

In Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\Abstract.php in the function \_describeTableInformationSchema() there is the following sql query:

$sql = "SELECT c.table\_schema, c.table\_name, c.column\_name, c.ordinal\_position as column\_ordinal\_position, c.data\_type, c.column\_default, c.is\_nullable, c.character\_octet\_length , c.numeric\_precision, c.numeric\_scale, c.character\_set\_name, tc.constraint\_type, k.ordinal\_position as key\_ordinal\_position FROM INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS c LEFT JOIN (INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.KEY\_COLUMN\_USAGE k JOIN INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.TABLE\_CONSTRAINTS tc ON (k.table\_schema = tc.table\_schema AND k.table\_name = tc.table\_name AND tc.constraint\_type = 'PRIMARY KEY' )) ### ON (c.table\_schema = k.table\_schema AND c.table\_name = k.table\_name AND c.column\_name = k.column\_name) WHERE c.table\_name = '$tableName'";

Currently the select returns all columns as primary keys (if they are primary keys in other tables), which is not the desired behavior. Another condition should be added "AND k.constraint\_name = tc.constraint\_name" before the line marked with ###. That way the select will behave correctly.

The solution in the description was wrong. Corrected the description.

Assign to Bill Karwin.

Fixed the query in revision 4202.

Also in that same revision, eliminated the use of the \_describeTableInformationSchema() method, because it is way to slow. See ZF-1117.
