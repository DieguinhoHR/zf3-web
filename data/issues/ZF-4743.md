ZF-4743: Zend\_Session is too aggressive about catching errors during session\_start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Session installs an error handler to catch any errors triggered by session\_start, and then rethrows them as an exception if it caught any. However, it catches all errors (mask set to E\_ALL)

This causes problems when session\_start writes NOTICE level errors which probably do not signify a session\_start problem.

I'd propose changing the set\_error\_handler call:

 
        set_error_handler(array('Zend_Session_Exception', 'handleSessionStartError'), E_ALL);


to set\_error\_handler(array('Zend\_Session\_Exception', 'handleSessionStartError'), E\_ALL & ~E\_NOTICE);

Not sure what version this is, but the RCS tags at the top say:

- @version $Id: Session.php 5500 2007-06-29 14:39:50Z darby $
- @since Preview Release 0.2

This is a show stopper.

Resolved as part of r15640 for ZF-3020, see the option throw\_startup\_exceptions- the ability to pass in a integer (error level)
