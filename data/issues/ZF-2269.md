### Description

This new filter provides the flexibility to not have to write a custom ZF filter when filtering is already available from another function.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class Zend_Filter_Callback implements Zend_Filter_Interface {
        /**
         * The callback function/method.
         *
         * @var callback
         */
        protected $_callback;
    
        /**
         * Additional parameters to send to the callback function/method.
         *
         * @var array
         */
        protected $_params = array();
    
        /**
         * Instantiates the callback filter.
         *
         * @param   $callback   The callback function/method.
         * @param   $params     Additional parameters to be sent to the callback function/method.
         */
        public function __construct($callback, array $params = array()) {
            $this->setCallback($callback)->_params = $params;
        }
    
        /**
         * Sets the callback function/method.
         *
         * @param   callback    $callback
         *
         * @return  Zend_Filter_Callback
         */
        public function setCallback($callback) {
            if (!is_callable($callback)) {
                throw new Zend_Filter_Exception('Invalid callback');
            }
    
            $this->_callback = $callback;
    
            return $this;
        }
    
        /**
         * Calls the callback function/method.
         *
         * @param   mixed   $value
         *
         * @return  mixed
         */
        public function filter($value) {
            $params = array_merge(array($value), $this->_params);
    
            return call_user_func_array($this->_callback, $params);
        }
    }

Please evaluate and categorize/assign as necessary.

Ralph, can you find a course of action on this issue, please?

There is already a small Zend\_Filter\_Callback implemented but it lacks 2 things which are solved in the above code:

- It does not check if the callback can be called
- It does not provide default parameters

Both would be a good addition to the existing class.

I'd suggest one of the following approaches:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = $this->_params;
    call_user_func_array($this->_callback, array($value, $params));


or:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $params = $this->_params;
    array_unshift($params, $value);
    call_user_func_array($this->_callback, $params);


with preference going to the latter.

The mentioned two improvements have been added to trunk. Additionally there exists now a chapter in the manual which was missing before.
