ZF-391: Zend\_Locale\_Format::getNumber() returns wrong results
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Rev 1101 Line 64ff.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($symbols['decimal'] != '.') {
        $found[0] = str_replace($symbols['decimal'],".",$found[0]);
        $found[0] = (float) $found[0];
    } else {
        $found[0] = (int) $found[0];
    }
    
    return $found[0];


Do you see the error? If $symbols['decimal'] is not a dot this function returns always floats (i.e. locale de), else integers (i.e. locale en).

Improvement proposal: How about optionally returning as string? Float has a limited precision. I couldn't get returned numbers containing more then 12 digits without loss of precision. 1234567890.1234 returns a float 1234567890.12

Correction and improvement proposal:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function getNumber($input, $locale, $asString = false)
    {
      ...
        if ($symbols['decimal'] != '.')
            $found[0] = str_replace($symbols['decimal'], '.', $found[0]);
    
        if ($asString)
            return $found[0];
    
        return (strpos($found[0], '.') !== false) ? (float) $found[0] : (int) $found[0];
    }

My fault...

But I don't see the problem. I will erase the type-converting and this will do the thing.

There will always a string be returned, but it is normalized. So when someone will do

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $number = "123.456.789.012,345678901"
    $normalized = Zend_Locale_Format::getNumber($number,'de_DE');


it returns "123456789012.345678901".

This way the function will also handle any size of numbers. The only thing the user has to be aware is when he normalized a number bigger as integer. Then he has to use the bcmath functions for computing them.

Is this acceptable ?

Btw:

There will also be a function "getFloat" where you can define a precission. So "getNumber" should only return the Integer part (precission 0).

Leaving the result of getNumber() as string would be fine in my opinion. If someone really needs a typecast ... that's not a big thing.

I don't think there is a need for both the functions getFloat() and getInteger(). It would be be an extra service of Zend\_Locale\_Format, but I can't imagine a use for it. If a non localized formatting is needed (i.e. for an SQL string), the normalized string can be formatted using number\_format() or sprintf() or for bigger numbers using i.e. bcadd('12345678901234567890.1234567890123456789', 0, $scale);

When someone will do a

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $number = Zend_Locale_Format::getNumber('123.456.789.0123.456,789',Zend_Locale::de_DE);
    $result = $number + 10;


he would get an error... because $number is bigger than $number. It would be autotype-converted to float and loose the precision.

But when he does a getInteger he can be sure that the result is an integer... otherwise he would get an false returned.

And getFloat would have an additional parameter, where you can define the precision.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $number = Zend_Locale_Format::getFloat('123,45678',3,Zend_Locale::de_DE);
    // returns 123.456


Number is related to is\_numeric Integer is related to is\_int Float is related to is\_float

And you always have a getxxx, a setxxx, and a isxxx function. All functions are per definition locale-aware.

Hmmm... in my opinion the job of the local class ends after a successful normalization. But if you think different, that's o.k. I can ignore the functions I don't have a use for as long as getNumber() works fine. :-)

Thanks for correcting the bug. You may close this issue.

Zend\_Locale\_Format::getNumer() now returns only string.
