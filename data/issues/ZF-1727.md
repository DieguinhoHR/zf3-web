### Description

In Zend/Controller/Dispatcher/Standard.php up to ZF 1.0.0 there is this code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isDispatchable(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
        {
            $className = $this->getControllerClass($request);
            if (!$className) {
                return true;
            }
    
            $fileSpec    = $this->classToFilename($className);
            $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
            $test        = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $fileSpec;
            return Zend_Loader::isReadable($test);
        }


To perform as described in the phpdoc it should be:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function isDispatchable(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
        {
            $className = $this->getControllerClass($request);
            if (!$className) {
                return false;
            }
    
            $fileSpec    = $this->classToFilename($className);
            $dispatchDir = $this->getDispatchDirectory();
            $test        = $dispatchDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $fileSpec;
            return Zend_Loader::isReadable($test);
        }


No real functionality is missed having 'return true' instead of 'return false'.

Assigning to [~matthew] to initiate issue review.

I noticed this bug too, it prevents me from using the ErrorHandler plugin (and the ErrorController/errorAction()) because the default controller gets used in case of a non-existing controllername. Returning false like shown in the code above fixes this.

The code was that way to make it possible to have a default route of IndexController::indexAction() when no controller is specified. However, that behaviour in isDispatchable() is definitely non-intuitive, so I've made a patch that fixes the issue in revision 6460. I will commit to the release branch pending review.
