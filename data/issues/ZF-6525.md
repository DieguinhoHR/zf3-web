### Description

I cannot get Zend\_Tool to work at all. This is all I get:-

paul-courts-mac-pro:XAMP\_Build paul$ zf show version PHP 5.2.9 (cli) (built: May 4 2009 22:25:46) Copyright (c) 1997-2009 The PHP Group Zend Engine v2.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2009 Zend Technologies .:/Volumes/WORK/XAMP/lib/php/ An Error Has Occurred

I added the commands to show the php version and the include path to zf.sh just to make sure, and my very short test script works fine. Any ideas?

Are you sure ZF is in your include path?

Just found the problem. It does not like the "Zend" entry in my include path being a symlink!

I did a little debugging, as well, as I get the same errors on "release-1.8.3", using a symlink to Zend in my "include\_path". I added the following in Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/HelpSystem.php on line 164 to test a few things:

[code] var\_dump(array( 'Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader available?' => class\_exists('Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader', false), 'Is autoloading enabled?' => ( spl\_autoload\_functions() !== false ), 'Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::autoload() registered?' => ( in\_array(array('Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader', 'autoload'), (array) spl\_autoload\_functions()) ), )); [code]

Then executing "zf.sh" with no arguments, the expected output should be:

[code] array(3) { ["Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader available?"]=> bool(true) ["Is autoloading enabled?"]=> bool(true) ["Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::autoload() registered?"]=> bool(true) } [code]

Actual:

[code] array(3) { ["Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader available?"]=> bool(false) ["Is autoloading enabled?"]=> bool(false) ["Is Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::autoload() registered?"]=> bool(false) } [code]

I was able to remedy the problem by performing either of the following in Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/HelpSystem.php @ 164:

[code] require\_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php'; Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::getInstance(); // Register the autoloader... require\_once 'Zend/Version.php'; // Or just include the unloaded class before it's used... [code]

The bug actually appears to be in Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console::\_preInit() @ 111, where the autoloader class is registered:

[code] // support setting the loader from the environment if (isset($\_ENV['ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS'])) { if (class\_exists($\_ENV['ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS']) || Zend\_Loader::loadClass($\_ENV['ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS']) ) { $this->\_registry->setLoader(new $\_ENV['ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS']); } } [code]

Note that there's no "else" clause there if the $\_ENV variable isn't set, so Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader doesn't get registered by default. Thus, if "ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS" isn't set in our local environments, the autoloader stack is empty. Boo. I'll attach a patch.

This patch should be applied to the base project directory and affect Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console, adding default autoloader support via Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::autoload() if no other class is specified via the ENV variable ZEND\_TOOL\_FRAMEWORK\_LOADER\_CLASS. It contains the following lines, applied to library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console.php @ 119:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            // otherwise register the default autoloader: Zend_Loader_Autoloader
            else {
                require_once 'Zend/Loader/Autoloader.php';
                $this->_registry->setLoader(Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance());
            } // END if-else


The problem from this ticket can also be resolved by patching Zend\_Tool\_Framework\_Client\_Console\_HelpSystem by adding the following line to library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Client/Console/HelpSystem.php @ 164:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            require_once 'Zend/Version.php';


However, the included patch is a more elegant solution, IMO, since it addresses a yet undetected issue with Zend\_Tool, as explained above. Please feel free to apply either. I'm using the former for now. Thanks,

David @ OrlandoPHP.org

If an admin would also please edit my earlier comment to correct my use of "[code]" instead of "```" for readability. Thanks.

Actually, scratch that. I neglected to test before I uploaded that patch. The simpler, more specific one does the job, although having an autoloader registered would be handy, too... However, my earlier patch doesn't actually _do_ that. Sorry.

So this _does_ get Zend\_Tool _executable_ for me, but the list of providers is still empty, and zf.sh does not recognize any commands...

 

 

Posted by David Rogers (al\_the\_x) on 2009-06-13T13:33:30.000+0000

To test out Paul's solution, I renamed my symlink and copied over the contents of the "Zend" directory into my include\_path, instead. zf.sh ? now returns a list of colorized providers, but this problem still bugs me...

 

 

Posted by David Rogers (al\_the\_x) on 2009-06-13T15:00:34.000+0000

So my workaround for the moment is to set the ENV variable ZEND\_TOOL\_INCLUDE\_PATH\_PREPEND to /usr/local/share/php/Zend\_Framework/library/, and I've found the following in library/Zend/Tool/Framework/Loader/IncludePathLoader.php @ 98:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    // no links allowed here for now
                    if ($item->isLink()) {
                        continue;
                    }


Apparently there's not a good solution for what to do with symlinks at this point, yet the [Quickstart Documentation](http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart/create-your-project) recommends a symlink to the library... Obviously _after_ you get zf.sh running, though.

Perhaps the problem here is that the IncludePathLoader is scanning the _entire tree_ defined by the include\_path for files named "Manifest.php" or "Provider.php", which seems rather wasteful... Couldn't this operate more like the Plugin patterns, such that a number of known, assumed valid paths / namespaces are added to a stack for scanning...? That would bypass the symlink problem, at least.

Is there a use-case for walking the _entire tree_ like that?

I think this issue could be resolved by ZF-7036. It seems to be more simply.

I think it would be too complex to use Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader.
