This appears to have been corrected with other updates.

Problem still exists.

Problem appears only if full tests suite is passed. It seems some other test doesn't restore Zend\_Loader state.

Problem is caused by registered autoload method (Zend\_Loader\_Autoloader::autoload()).

It tries to include file which doesn't exists. Thus correct behavior (false returned by class\_exists() function) is changed to throwing error.

Fixed.

The problem was caused by Zend\_LoaderTest setUp()/tearDown() methods - original loaders state wasn't restored.

BTW It illustrates a real problem of using autoloader with class\_exist() method.
