ZF-10070: Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Sqlsrv generates notices and has code out of the coding standards
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The default value of the property $\_keys of Zend\_Db\_Statement\_Sqlsrv must be an array, becouse in the fetch() method, some lines expects an array of this property: $this->\_keys[], array\_combine($this->\_keys, $values). The classe is using tabs and not 4 spaces.

During the correction I saw other classes of Zend\_Db that were out of the coding standard and with incorrect docbloc.
