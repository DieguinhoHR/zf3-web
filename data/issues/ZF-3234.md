### Description

According to [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.7),

{quote} The 306 status code was used in a previous version of the specification, is no longer used, and the code is reserved. {quote}

If Redirector is HTTP/1.1-compliant (and I think it should be... HTTP/1.1 has been a standard for almost nine years and is universally implemented), then it should observe this restriction.

Matthew, if you find this reasonable, can you indicate that and find someone to assign it to? Mr. Ratzloff comes to mind. . . :)
