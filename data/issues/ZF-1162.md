### Description

The methods beginTransaction, commit and rollBack of the Mysqli driver are handling transactions incorrectly.

1) beginTransaction

This method is calling connection->beginTransaction. This method doesn't exist in mysqli class. According to the documentation, a transaction in mysqli must be started by the autocommit method.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // the line
    $this->_connection->beginTransaction();
    // should be changed to
    $this->_connection->autocommit(false);


2) commit

After calling the commit method of the mysqli class, the autocommit mode should be turned on (or at least we could have an argument or property to configure this behavior).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // this line should be added after calling connection->commit
    $this->_connection->autocommit(true);


3) rollBack

Same as commit.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // this line should be added after calling connection->rollback
    $this->_connection->autocommit(true);
