### Description

I have problem with ZF and PHP5.2.8, MySQL 5.0.51 My table:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    CREATE TABLE `categories` (
      `id_c` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
      `name_c` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      `link_c` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      `films_c` int(3) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY  (`id_c`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8


I have model categories.

Zend\_Debug::dump($categories->fetchAll()); give me info:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        ["_cols:protected"] => array(4) {
          [0] => string(4) "id_c"
          [1] => string(6) "name_c"
          [2] => string(6) "link_c"
          [3] => string(7) "films_c"
        }


but $categories->fetchAll()->toArray(); give me:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [0] => Array
            (
                [id_c] => 27
                [name_c] => some
                [categories] => 19
            )
    )


I don't see columns: link\_c and films\_c and I don't have column 'categories'.

$categories->getAdapter()->fetchAll("select \* from categories"); also has this bug.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $a = $categories->getAdapter()->fetchAll("select id_c as IDA,name_c as NAMEC,link_c as LINKS,films_c as VIDEO from categories");


give me:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [0] => Array
            (
                [IDA] => 27
                [name_c] => some
                [categories] => 19
            )
    )


My question is Why?

- - - - - -

I had on phpinfo(): mysqli section: Client API library version : 5.0.51a Client API header version : 5.1.30

now I have the same values and ZF is working.

Hi Zend Team, I am running the following:

Windows 7 Enterprise, Zend Server Community Edition (5.0.3), Zend Framework 1.10.

The above problem appears in my application too. Whenever i try to fetch some data from my Mysql db some columns are missing and some others are beeing replaced by some metadata information (column name replaced with $table\_name , string 'def'). Please help me with this issue as i am stuck with this problem.

Note: I've tried 2 methods a. by extending 'Zend\_Db\_Table' b. by using "$this->adapter = Zend\_Db::factory( $this->configuration->getAdapterType(), $this->configuration->getParameters() ); $results = $this->adapter->fetchAll( "select \* from invoice\_row" );"
