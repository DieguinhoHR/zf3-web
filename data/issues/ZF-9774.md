### Description

An error occurred Application error Exception information:

Message: SOAP extension is not loaded.

I am using the following syntax to consume service

$client = new Zend\_Soap\_Client('[https://developer-api.affili.net/V2.0/â€¦](https://developer-api.affili.net/V2.0/PublisherInbox.svc?wsdl)');

Any help in this regard is highly appreciated. Thanks in anticipation.
