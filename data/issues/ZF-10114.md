### Description

The line

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $locale = new Zend_Locale();


triggers a PHP notice: Undefined index: HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE in Zend/Locale.php on line 430 when the script runs from the CLI mode.

To expand on this report a little: Zend\_Locale::getBrowser() is run every time the class is instantiated, even if a locale is manually passed into the class. In the past, this has not caused any issues because the function just returned an empty array when it wasn't able to detect the locale by "getenv('HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE')"

However, a recent change (r. 22529) added support for the $\_SERVER variable "HTTP\_ACCEPT\_LANGUAGE" as well. The actual bug is that it assumes this $\_SERVER variable is always set, when, in fact, it is not usually set by non-browser clients like cURL unless the developer has set it explicitly. In theory, we just need to make sure the index exists:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $httplanguages = getenv('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE');
    if (empty($httplanguages) && isset($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'])) {
        $httplanguages = $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'];
    }

Closing as fixed
