### Description

_The two patches are mutually exclusive and present two different solutions to the same issue._

Currently, views automatically disable all warnings when using unset variables. This results in typos not producing warnings. However, many developers do not wish to see warnings when unset variables are used. The patch below provides a convenient compromise, supporting both checking for typos and ignoring unset variables.

Given a choice, I prefer the alternative patch that relies on the View helper "DeclareVars".

Assigning to [~matthew].

While I see the view helper patch as elegant, I feel that the view object integration makes more sense from a usage point of view -- it's simpler, and I feel most developers will find it natural to call declareVars() than to utilize a helper.

I will implement this prior to the 0.9.2 release.

I wrote the DeclareVars view helper after the first patch above to address some shortcomings with the functionality provided by the view object patch. I won't have time this week to revisit the view object patch and try to upgrade it to support the same level of functionality in the DeclareVars view helper.

I see \_\_get() in Abstract.php more as a problem and less as a feature. A developer can not easily remove \_\_get() to implement their own alternatives (e.g. DeclareVars). With the DeclareVars view helper alternative, the developer is free to drop in a replacement into their view helper script path. With the current Abstract.php (i.e. \_\_get()), the DeclareVars view helper won't work.

Perhaps we can make both alternatives possible with a little refactoring.

I applied your patch (minus the "->view = $this" segment) in my local tree. My issue is that one of the touted benefits of Zend\_View is that you _can_ access variables that have not been set, without raising notices. This patch, because it removes \_\_get(), causes a ton of E\_NOTICE messages to be raised. Additionally, it _requires_ the developer to use the declareVars() helper if they want to avoid them.

My thought is to have an accessor by which one may change a 'strictVars' flag; if set, \_\_get() would trigger a notice; otherwise, the normal behaviour would be observed (i.e., null returned and no notice).

This provides an easy way for a developer to modify the settings pre- and post-production (turn on strictVars() during development, turn it off in production). I will still add the declareVars helper, because when used with strictVars(), it could provide exactly the behaviour you suggest in your patch -- it just wouldn't be the default behaviour.

If more advanced functionality is desired, such as logging when undefined variables are accessed, or wanting to set strictVars() on by default, the individual developer could extend Zend\_View or Zend\_View\_Abstract.

Yes, perfect! I like this blend of optional and default behaviors :)

Added the following functionality in r4332: \* Setting $view->strictVars(true); will cause \_\_get() to raise E\_USER\_NOTICEs when variables have not been previously declared \* Added the DeclareVars helper. This helper will set any variables passed to it in the view object, with default values if the variable does not already exist. Used in conjunction with strictVars(), it helps suppress notices for valid, optional template variables.
