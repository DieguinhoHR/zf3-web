ZF-9442: Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label double translates element label

### Description

Related to ZF-6877

Zend\_Form\_Element::getLabel() will now translate the label (from ZF-6877); however, Zend\_Form\_Decorator\_Label will also translate the label which causes a double-translation and some odd side effects.

For instance: if you are using an adapter which marks un-translated strings by pre-pending and appending the messageId with a recognizable string, the string will be marked twice (see unit test).

I will attach a patch which adds a unit test to demonstrate the issue. Also attached patch which fixes the label decorator and passes unit test. Patch is against svn trunk@21533

Duplicates ZF-8694. A fix has been proposed there.
