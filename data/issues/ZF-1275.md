Sorry, can you give some more background info on why? They were already renamed once in the past. The "CookieJar" object is not a sub-class (logically or programatically) of Cookie objects.

Obviously it would be very easy to change, but I would like to understand the reason. A reference to the coding standards would be nice as well.

Hmmm okay, the name was irritating me but I think it is in conflict with [3.2 of our coding standards](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/PHP+Coding+Standard+%28draft%29#PHPCodingStandard%28draft%29-Classes). I can't find anything regarding to the last rename (or was it Cookiejar -> CookieJar?). The only reason is the name because there is Zend\_Http\_Cookie and Zend\_Http\_CookieJar.

This doesn't conflict with the coding standards. Moreover, Since this is not a (logical or programmatic) subclass of Zend\_Http\_Cookie I don't see the point in adding another level of hierarchy.

Unless guided otherwise by development team leaders or more people from the community, this won't be changed.

Agreed. There are numerous examples in the ZF library of class names in CamelCase, without requiring extra directory levels. This is not in conflict with the coding conventions.
