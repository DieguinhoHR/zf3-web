ZF-9298: When accidentally entering an array as the second parameter in db->delete it deletes the whole table

### Description

$this->\_db->delete('order', array('id'=>$orderId));

When running the above code, Zend creates the following SQL:

DELETE FROM `order` WHERE (36468)

(36468 being an existing order id)

And this subsequently deletes the entire MySQL table, having the same effect as TRUNCATE TABLE.

Although this only happens when using an incorrect type for the parameter, considering the data loss implecations there should be a safety check within delete() to make sure that the whole table isn't deleted should an array be accidentally passed as the second parameter.

This is not a big. You have simply missed something. $this->\_db->delete('order', array('id = ?' => $orderId)); as detailed in the manual will produce the desired result.

I am closing this as not an issue.

One of our employees, we do not know who, created this faulty code, and it has taken us a lot of time and resources to find out what was causing the order table to be deleted, as a first glance at the code did't look like it had anything wrong with it. If this happened to us, there is a good chance it could happen to someone else, and therefore it is worth addressing. It wouldn't exactly take a long time to address.

I do agree that following the instructions from the manual would produce the desired result, but should any of Zend's database functions be able to unintentionally delete an entire database table?

Yes.

Actually it's the same as plain sql: DELETE FROM tableName DELETE FROM tableName WHERE id =

( to be replaced with something decent)

Any decent RDBMS will actually delete more once your query is shorter. Hence it wouldn't make sense for zend\_db to differentiate from that.
