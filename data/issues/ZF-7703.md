ZF-7703: Int validator assumes 'en' Locale integers are valid, despite specifying a different locale
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If you specify a locale, the isValid() method validates the value with Zend\_Locale\_Format::isInteger() using the specified locale. However, In addition to the specified locale, it also validates with an 'en'-based Zend\_Locale.

Should the validator assume that in all cases an 'en'-localized value is required, even though the user has explicitly defined which locale they wish to validate with?
