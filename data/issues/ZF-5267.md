ZF-5267: Check immediate functionality not complete or missing

### Description

Trying Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId::setCheckImmediate(true) will always render a failing authorization if the provider have not auto accepted the requested url, which is fine. However, there is no implementation to retrieve the returned openid\_user\_setup\_url that should contain the next step URL for the client to decide how this url should be presented.

The Zend\_OpenId\_Consumer::verify() function will always stop at this code (because there are no return\_to param when immediate is used): if (empty($params['openid\_return\_to'])) { $this->\_setError("Missing openid.return\_to"); return false; }

If you want the client to control the next process it will not work and the class is therefor not useful for that (for example implementing OpenID validation using an Ajax framework, which would be simple with Dojo if Zend\_Auth\_Adapter\_OpenId return openid\_user\_setup\_url in the array of getMessages() function).

I have found a solution to the problem with setImmediate functionality to be able to use this adapter in an Ajax window.

When set\_immediate mode is used, you only need to fetch the setup\_mode and openid\_user\_setup\_url parameters from the request object or using $\_GET/$\_POST to take appropriate action. However, it would be nice to take care of setup\_mode in an event/callback of this module instead.

I am using this functionality of Zend\_OpenId to login using Ajax, done with Dojos iframe.
