### Description

In the \_setupPrimaryKey method of class Zend\_Db\_Abstract maybe you could change the code from this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->_sequence === true && $this->_db instanceof Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Pgsql) {
                $this->_sequence = "{$this->_name}_{$pkIdentity}_seq";
    }


to something like this

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($this->_sequence === true && $this->_db instanceof Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Pgsql) {
                $this->_sequence =($this->_schema ? $this->_schema . '.' : '') .  "{$this->_name}_{$pkIdentity}_seq";
    }


assuming that the sequence belongs to the same schema as the table, if this isn't the case it can still be overridden by setting the sequence name

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->_sequence = "different_schema.sequence_name";
