### Description

Currently, the load() method on the memcached backend does not support fetching more than one key at a time. Hence, fetching a hundred keys requires a hundred calls.

A lot of resources would be saved if one could do bulk fetching. The memcached driver (and a lot of the other backends, e.g. xcache and apc) support bulk fetching out of the box. Creating a new method (for example, loadArrayOfIds()) would make it possible to keep BC compatibility whilst adding this helpful functionality.
