ZF-4035: Zend\_Paginator lacks an easy way to pass search params

### Description

It should provide a static method setParams.

'm using Paginator like this: $select = $this->db->select() ->from(array('mh' => 'merlin\_hotel')) ->join(array('mt' => 'merlin\_trip') ,'mt.id = mh.trip\_id', array() ); $select->where('mh.region = ?',$region);

$paginator = Zend\_Paginator::factory($select); $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber((int)$this->getRequest()->getParam('page')); $this->view->paginator = $paginator; $this->render("results")

but the links that are being rendered later in the pagination\_control.phtml do not contain the query parameters that were set before. To achieve that, I have to pass the params from controller to the viewscript and then from the view script to pagination view script and again then merge with 'page' param which is pointless and not making it easier at all.

one could have done Zend\_Paginator::addParams($array) if it would provide an easy way to do that (or it should discover it automagically and persist from DB Adapter)

I'm leaning towards saying this is not really an issue. It's not Paginator's job to pass variables to a view partial. The partial approach is the prefered way of rendering the pagination control, but certainly not the only one. You could just render the page items and the navigation in the same view script. Another idea is for you to write a view helper that automates some of this work.

Zend\_View\_Helper\_PaginationControl provides a means of doing this already. You pass the parameters to the view (possibly in an array), then pass that array as the fourth parameter.

Note that you do not need to specify the scrolling style and view partial every call. Once ZF-4037 is resolved you will be able to simply say:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->paginationControl($this->paginator, null, null, $this->paginatorParams);
