### Description

In Dojo/View/Helper/Dojo/Container.php, the djconfig parameter parseOnLoad is forced to true when using declarative style. There are cases, however, when manually running the parser after custom code may be desired. So we should be able to override the default parseonload: true using setDjConfigOption.

The only way to do this is to check if parseOnLoad has been previously set; otherwise, the default should be to turn it on.

Scheduling for RC3.

Fixed in trunk and 1.6 release branch. Set the djConfig option "parseOnLoad" to "false" to disable.
