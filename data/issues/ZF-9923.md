Could you supply a little more information? only the error message is very ambiguous to say the least, there are several circumstances which could cause that error.

please provide, at least. \* The usecase when it happened \* An example to be able to reproduce the issue \* A full description of the problem.

If this is not provided, this issue will have to be closed, with no further investigation.

Please provide further info as comments, not edits, so that a trail can be seen of the feedback you provided.

You still have not supplied enough information. Please provide the circumstance under which this error occurred.

Also, please note, the current version of Zend Framework is 1.10.5. You should always first upgrade to the latest version before making bug reports, as your problem may already be fixed in a later release.

If this is a support request, please close this issue, and direct the support request to either #zftalk on IRC, or to the mailing list. This issue tracker is only for genuine issues or improvement requests.

Are you trying to run the IndexController.php script directly? If so, this is not an intended use case, as that script simply contains a class, which is intended to be invoked via the front controller.

We need much more information in order to begin any work that might be needed on this issue. I am going to close the issue; please continue inquiries and troubleshooting via one of the mailing lists (<http://framework.zend.com/archives>); only after you have confirmation that there is an issue should you re-open this issue or open a new one.
