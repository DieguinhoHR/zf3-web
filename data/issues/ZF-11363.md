### Description

Keys in yaml files containing dashes are broken and end up with only the last part of the key:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    router:
      routes:
        my-route:
          route: my/route


...will result in...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    router:
      routes:
        route:
          route: my/route


This is due the regex using /w, and is easily fixed by adding the dash (line 134).

I know, the documentation states 'specifying other parsers should you want more complex syntax' but just for a dash this seems overkill, especially as the other config classes DO support them.

Assigned to Stanislav for consideration as he wrote Zend\_Config\_Yaml

Patch works for me; all tests (both bug-specific and component-wide) pass. This is supported by the spec, so I see no reason not to include it. Same goes for ZF-11934.
