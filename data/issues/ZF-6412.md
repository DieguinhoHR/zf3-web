### Description

Rendering Zend\_Form\_Element\_Captcha in Zend\_Form with a label decorator results in invalid HTML, where is not correctly paired with the captcha's field.

{quote}

Captcha {quote} As can be seen, with its for attribute points to "captcha" element, while there is no element with this id. Proper behavior would be pointing to "captcha-input", as it is a text input field for captcha value.
