ZF2-512: InputFilter cannot be serialized
-----------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Improvement Created: 2012-08-31T07:02:54.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-10-08T20:14:45.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

Both ValidatorChain and InputFilterChain have references to ServiceManager, which in turn registers Traits. For this reason chains cannot be serialized, and as a result InputFilter cannot be serialized.

According to my tests, cached (and serialized) InputFilter adds 10X performance improvement compared to InputFilter that is initialized from the scratch.
