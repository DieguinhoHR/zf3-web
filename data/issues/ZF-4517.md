ZF-4517: Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext: processing wrong translation files can generate empty translation arrays for a locale

### Description

Problem description: Using Zend\_Translate with language files autodiscovery option (Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_FILENAME). There are language files for a given language but there aren't for some dialects (i.e., es.mo exists, es\_ES.mo not). The default stablished locale is one of the dialect s without file (i.e., es\_ES), and the requested page locale is that dialect (i.e.,es\_ES). Language files directory has been SVN checked out (so it contains a .svn dir and svn config. files). Under this circumstances, if the subversion config files are processed before the right language files, an empty internal translation array ($this->\_translate member) is generated for the dialect locale (i.e., es\_ES), so Zend\_Translate fails when a call to Zend\_Translate->setLocale is made for that dialect locale (es\_ES in our example).

The origin of this bug is Zend\_Translate\_Adapter\_Gettext->\_loadTranslationData (lines 84 to 97). When a wrong file is processed, an exception is thrown, but under the circumstances above the internal translation array has been already initialized (with an empty array) and nobody clears it. A solution could be to check if the translation array is set but empty before throwing the exception: [...] // Patch if (is\_set($this->\_translate[$locale]) && empty($this->\_translate[$locale])) { unset($this->\_translate[$locale]); } // End of patch throw new Zend\_Translate\_Exception([...]) [...]

Your circumstance is wrong...

Files and Directories beginning with "." are ignored per default. See the "ignore" Option.

And you thoughts are also not exact.... if you search for FILENAME and a filename is found the locale will be set, even if no translation is within this file.

The reason is, that often empty files are used as placeholder for new languages, which would not work when we would integrate what you showed as solution.

Also when you have es\_ES empty and es filled, it would still be no problem at all, because translation will still work. Rerouting is always available in I18N.

You are right, the translation process works, and you get a right translation (from es.mo file) even with an empty translation array. But all this stuff generates a warning, and those made me to overqualify this, so I'll try to cancel the issue if possible.

About the ignore option, I never heard about it until you mentioned it... And then i found your blog entry and all became clear.

No problem at all... Things are now cleared.
