ZF-3707: Incorrect documentation on Zend\_Controller\_Action\_Helper\_Redirector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Problem Created: 2008-07-21T14:03:35.000+0000 Last Updated: 2009-04-26T15:03:28.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

The manual section on the redirector action helper is incorrect. In the manual it says:

{quote} setGoto() can be used to set a default URL to use if none is passed to goto(). Uses the API of Zend\_Controller\_Action::\_forward(): setgoto($action, $controller = null, $module = null, array $params = array()); {quote}

The setGoto() method is now named setGotoSimple(). The same goes for goto(), which now is called gotoSimple().

This incorrectness is spread out in the entire manual section on the helper.

I just noticed that the helper uses \_\_call() to proxy the old method names (goto, setgoto gotoandexit), so this might not be a problem after all.

Not a bug.
