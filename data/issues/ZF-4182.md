ZF-4182: Ignore certain query parameters in Zend\_Db\_Profiler\_Firebug
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2008-09-03T23:04:21.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-07-17T12:53:08.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

Some query parameters such as binary data break the display of the profiling table in FirePHP.

Any parameter value that cannot be transported and displayed in the Firebug Console as is needs to be modified to escape it or replaced with a placeholder.

Sending binary data such as a gzip compressed file to the console does not make sense. We should simply display "Binary Data" or similar.

How would I check if a variable is binary?

I don't consider this an issue for ZF, since this is a problem with firebug and if they ever fix it, you won't be able to throw binary data to firebug.
