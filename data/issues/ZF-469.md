ZF-469: Zend\_View::render is printing the view instead of just returning the rendered view

### Description

From the manual:

"Once you have assigned all needed variables, the controller should tell Zend\_View to render a particular view script. Do so by calling the render() method. Note that the method will return the rendered view, not print it, so you need to print or echo it yourself at the appropriate time."

But my view is printed when I call Zend\_View::render. To avoid this, I had to call ob\_start, then render, then ob\_get\_clean. I'm rendering a view inside another view, if it matters.

Examining the code, I'm having trouble seeing how this can happen, and my usage of Zend\_View has never resulted in what you describe; $view->render() always returns the output without rendering it.

Can you provide the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce the issue? (even if it requires blocks from several files) This will help me produce a test case so I can better troubleshoot the issue.

OK, here it is. I should have gotten a blank page, but I got the text in indexIndex.php instead.

File 1: index.php

<?php

set\_include\_path(get\_include\_path() . PATH\_SEPARATOR . './library/'); include 'Zend.php';

Zend::loadClass('Zend\_Controller\_Front'); Zend::loadClass('Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter'); $router = new Zend\_Controller\_RewriteRouter(); $controller = Zend\_Controller\_Front::getInstance(); $controller->setRouter($router);

Zend::loadClass('Zend\_View'); $view = new Zend\_View(); $view->setScriptPath('./application/views'); Zend::register('view', $view);

$controller->run('./application/controllers');

File 2: IndexController.php

<?php

class IndexController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action { public function indexAction() { $view = Zend::registry('view'); $view->content = 'indexIndex.php'; echo $view->render('general.php'); } }

File 3: general.php

<?php $content = $this->render($this->content); // It shouldn't display anything, right?

File 4: indexIndex.php

This text shouldn't be displayed.
