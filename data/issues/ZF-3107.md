### Description

{quote} The DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a MySQL extension to standard SQL that is very useful if you have clients that cannot or need not wait for the INSERT to complete. _This is a common situation when you use MySQL for logging_ (...) {quote}

Using INSERT DELAYED would improve the speed of Zend\_Log\_Writer\_Db. But you can't check, if the INSERT was successful. So maybe it should be an optional feature.

We'll consider this for 1.8. For now I am marking it postponed, which indicates that the feature request is sound, but we won't work on it immediately. Have you considered submitting a patch and a corresponding unit test to get it on to trunk sooner? Since it adds a few feature, we will have to wait for the next minor release (1.8).

one has to check for the mysql adapters when this is a mysql only option, which makes it somewhat more compliacated, otherwise it sounds like a good optimization.
