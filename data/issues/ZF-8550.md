### Description

Table 4.2 (Zend\_Application Methods) cannot be read on [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.application.core-functionality.html) because the right-hand menu element lays on top of a large part of the table. This happens in Firefox, IE and Safari. Have not tested any others. Have also seen this on occasion in other parts of the documentation as well, when the content is not able to wrap within the space that was intended for it in the site's design.

My apologies. It wasn't until after I created this issue that I came across one that already existed for it: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6242>
