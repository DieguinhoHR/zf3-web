ZF-9355: Hardcoded path '/var/www/data.dump' troblesome

### Description

The hardcoded path '/var/www/data.dump' in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Static on line 236 might be troublesome on those cases, where the user does not have access to that path. On my machine (OS X 10.6) I didn't even have that path predefined. After some reading I found out that the path is quite common in different linux distros...

One way go around this seems to bee to set file\_locking to false (seems to be tru by default).

I'd suggest this variable should be made customizable so that it can be set with the other caching options.

Currently I have to a) modify the core code or 2) set file\_locking to false. I don't know yet what implications setting this valeu to false has.

Hi Pádraic

I only found this line on saving data and only if file\_locking is enabled. I don't found where you read or check it.

Can we simply remove this line ?

Fixed in r21674 - sorry for the delay!
