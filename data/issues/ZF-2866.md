### Description

The Zend\_Session package is full of hardcoded variables that should be constants; e.g. '\_\_ZF', 'ENNH', etc. Would be much nicer if placed into Zend\_Session\_Abstract along the lines of:

const ZF\_NS const EXPIRE\_NS\_NS\_HOP etc.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Since the hardcoded values are not part of the public API (which constants are), i see no reason to make them constants.
