### Description

According to Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference (API Version 2009-02-01) there are two methods for getting and modifying Queue attributes: GetQueueAttributes and SetQueueAttributes

Zend\_Service\_Amazon\_Sqs provides only a wrapper getAttribute for GetQueueAttributes Amazon SQS API call.

So there is no way to change such queue param as MaximumMessageSize in Amazon Queue
