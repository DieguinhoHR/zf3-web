### Description

Initially I should note, that in case this is caused because I am doing something wrong, I am sorry in advance.

I've created a custom controller Plugin which in the preDispatch() under some circumstances, changes the $request object parameters to redirect the request to a different module/controller/action as such:

$request->setModuleName('module') ->setControllerName('controller') ->setActionName('action') ->setParam('param', 'value') ->setDispatched(false);

If the module/controller/action throws an Exception I log it via the ErrorController. However while trying to log via the FirePHP Writer, the writer goes into an endless loop in the encodeObject() function.

Please submit a test case or simple sample application.

Cannot proceed without test case.
