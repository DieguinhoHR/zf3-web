### Description

It would be nice if you could set a default value if a validation fails or when ALLOW\_EMPTY is used and no value was submitted

 
    <pre class="literal">
    $validators = array( 
        'year' = array( 
            'Digits',
            'allowEmpty' => true,
            'default' => date('Y')
        ) 
    );

An earlier version of my proposal for Zend\_Filter\_Input did have the capability of defining defaults.

I'd like to keep this feature request open but mark it postponed. We have a lot of other features to work on before ZF 1.0.0. This feature would be nice, but it's not mandatory for ZF 1.0, and it can be implemented in a future release of ZF without impacting backward-compatibility.

In the meantime, you should handle default values as part of your application logic.

Change summary. The solution I have implemented does not set default values for fields whose values fail validation. It just sets default values for missing fields.

Implemented in revision 5344.
