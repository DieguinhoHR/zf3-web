### Description

How can I get a file with Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl like I do with this code:

$ch = curl\_init(); curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_FILE, $output\_path); curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_HEADER, 0); curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $url\_to\_file); curl\_exec($ch); curl\_close($ch);

Thank you in advance

BTW take a look at [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.client.adapters.html#zend.http.client.adapters.curl) - esp. at how you can pass CURL-specific options to the adapter.

Shahar.
