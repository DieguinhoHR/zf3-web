ZF-8048: cannot use bind variables with Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2009-10-10T23:41:25.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:10.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

I've a query like

$q = "INSERT INTO `my_t` (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `field_val`, `mtime`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `field_val` = ?, `mtime` = ?" $db->query($query, array($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $d, $e);

This call apparently fails to bind all variables; the query does nothing.

Here's a patch implementing a Zend\_Db\_Adapter method for insertUpdating() . Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract gets a default implementation that throws an exception, because I assume that most RDBMSs do not have INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY or similar functionality. Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql gets an actual implementation, overriding the Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract one.

The point of attaching this patch here is that it demonstrates how I'd like to call Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::query with bound parameters. Perhaps this patch can also serve as a starting point for implementing insertUpdating() for the framework.

Set component to Zend\_Db
