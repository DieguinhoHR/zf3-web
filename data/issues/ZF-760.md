### Description

The page on AuthSub authentication should probably mention the lack of current support for registered AuthSub applications. With a registered application, the developer provides a certificate to Google and then uses a private key to sign all requests. This provides an additional layer of security. See the following URL for more information on registered applications: [http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/â€¦](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html)

Documented lack of support in ZF 0.7.

Still leaving this issue open so that we can implement support.
