### Description

I'v looked into the file Zend\_View\_Helper\_Navigation\_Menu on line 402

 
         if ($foundPage->hasPage($page)) {


this can't find the deeper page

Maybe this line could be

if ($foundPage->hasPage($page,true)) {

Is this a bug report, or is it more of a "so I browsed some code the other day and this line caught my attention, is it just me or is it kinda weird?" report?

In any case, the line isn't supposed to determine if the page is a descendant of the found page. It just checks if it's a sibling.

Without a problem description, we can't do anything.
