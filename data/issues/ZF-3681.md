### Description

Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module::assemble() in SVN uses '/' when making urls instead of self::URI\_DELIMITER. This patch fixes that.

This might be a better patch, although I am not sure if putting a const in an interface is considered bad form.

URI\_DELIMITER constant is introduced only in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Module and thus it cannot be used in other route classes as suggested in the patch attached in July 2008. In addition line numbers do not apply anymore making this patch pretty much decayed. I think that the URI\_DELIMITER should be declared in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Abstract so that it would also be available in other route classes. However, if I remember correct routing will be largely refactored in ZF2 so this issue could be resolved as won't fix.
