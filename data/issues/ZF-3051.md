ZF-3051: Cannot specify custom route type by using config

### Description

I have been trying to create custom routes by using the following syntax (copy and paste from the online docs):-

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    routes.news.type = "My_Route"
    routes.news.route = "news"
    routes.news.defaults.controller = "news"
    routes.news.defaults.action = "list"


My class 'My\_Route' extends Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route. However, the 'getInstance' method in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route uses the syntax new self(args) to return an instance. Because of PHP's late static binding limitations, this returns Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route rather than My\_Route.

Simon, unfortunately this is a correct behavior (in my own opinion). If you subclass a standard route class you also have to subclass getInstance method (same case as with Front Controller). If PHP 5.3 finally comes out and ZF bumps it's requirements a bit higher, then this will be "fixed". Until then, I'm afraid you will have to implement this in your class.

I'll resolve it as "Not an issue" but I will remember this issue and I'll reopen in case php 5.3 comes out.
