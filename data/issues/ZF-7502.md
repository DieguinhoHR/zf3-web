### Description

Currently: View/Helper/Navigation/Menu.php:391 ``` The "true" leads to the behaviour, that if I visit a subpage the parents are also marked as "class=active". There should be a switch to disable this. The actual behaviour is not so good when using yaml-layouts [1] for formatting the menu.

Do we _really_ need a switch for this too? Isn't the rendering code complex enough already? In my opinion, this falls outside the 80/20 rule.
