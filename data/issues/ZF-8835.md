ZF-8835: Zend\_Validate\_Isbn uses incomplete and deprecated regular expression

### Description

The component uses ereg in \_detectFormat

Ereg is deprecated as of PHP 5.3: <http://nl.php.net/ereg>

Also, the regular expression is not doing what it's supposed to do when using anything other than a blank separator. I think the underlined code below is supposed to check the total length of the string is equal to 17, but this does not work. See patch for a possible usage of preg\_match instead of ereg and checking the string length separately, see attached patch.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                                                                                                   ^^^^
