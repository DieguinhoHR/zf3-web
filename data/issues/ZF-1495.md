### Description

do $front->setParam('useDefaultControllerAlways', true) as describe in controller doc 7.3.4

let suppose we have 2 modules as following default controllers indexController.php errorController.php views ...

module1 controllers testController.php views script test index.php

if i ask /module1/ it wi ll failed because it load controller from default module (that's ok since useDefaultControllerAlways is true), but will try to render module1/views/script/index/index.php view !!!

With the ErrorHandler plugin in place, I cannot reproduce this issue. Can you post the actual controller and bootstrap code you use, please?
