### Description

Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document\_Html will not list links from image maps. To resolve we just need to add code to pull in all urls from the AREA tag's href. I have a fix ready. Where should I post it?

It is better to submit a patch than the whole file. It is hard to see what has changed if you provide the whole file. If you don't know how to make a patch, it is easy. Just run this command at the root of your svn repo: "svn diff > file\_name.patch" (without quotes).
