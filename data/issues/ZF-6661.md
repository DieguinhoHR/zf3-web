### Description

Hi!

It would be very nice if Zend\_Controller routers will be able to route a routes with an UTF8 symbols in it. That feature allows to create truly i18n web-sites, like Wikipedia.

It is very easy to add an UTF8 support to, for example, Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Regex - just add 'u' modifier to the route regexp:

Code starting at line 73:

 
    public function match($path, $partial = false)
    {
        if (!$partial) {
            $path = trim(urldecode($path), '/');
            $regex = '#^' . $this->_regex . '$#i';
        } else {
            $regex = '#^' . $this->_regex . '#i';
        }


just should be changed to

 
    public function match($path, $partial = false)
    {
        if (!$partial) {
            $path = trim(urldecode($path), '/');
            $regex = '#^' . $this->_regex . '$#iu';
        } else {
            $regex = '#^' . $this->_regex . '#iu';
        }


Adding unicode support slows down PHP PCRE engine and it would be wise to create a special construct-time flag to allow programmer decide if he/she really needs an UTF8 support in routes.

And as usual: thanks for the Framework! :)
