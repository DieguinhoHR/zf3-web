Issue related to ZF-882 / ZF-883. See added comments there for further information.

After looking in this I think the problems are related to this:

3) testisDate

-> always takes the standard locale. But the standardformat in different environments is not always as expected by this test

-> always verifies strict... maybe loose checking should also be implemented (isDate -> strict, isFixedDate -> loose). 2000-01-10 is not the same as 01-10-2000. isDate gives false, isFixedDate gives true for such inputs.

4) testTestDate -> see 3 -> locale and strict problem

5) testBasic -> see 3

I am working on some related issues that will address the date related issues above.

The issue of providing "isDate()" behavior involves many issues:

What date formats should be supported?
======================================

A locale is needed for proper interpretation/normalization of dates containing month names.
===========================================================================================

Should Zend\_Validate\_Date normalize month names (including abbreviated ones) in the input in order to parse the date? Should this be done always, or only when requested?
===========================================================================================================================================================================

What is the format of the date checked? (developer requested, default format for which locale?)
===============================================================================================

If the format defaults to the default format of the default locale, then the _exact_ same "is date" Zend\_Validate\_Date check might succeed for one web visitor, but not for another from a different locale. Is this behavior desired or should it be optional and only selected when explicitly requested by the developer?
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Should Zend\_Validate\_Date require the developer to specify the date format?
=============================================================================

Should Zend\_Validate\_Date require the developer to specify the locale?
========================================================================

Should Zend\_Validate\_Date indicate success for all dates that are valid, _after_ checking for detectable errors, and correcting correctable errors?
=====================================================================================================================================================

Should the automatic correction above happen with or without the developers explicit consent / request?
=======================================================================================================

Should Zend\_Validate\_Date even check dates in strings, or should it just wrap PHP's checkdate() function?
===========================================================================================================

The Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() and isLooseDate() related functions are designed for quite robust operation, and might or might not serve the needs of Zend\_Validate\_Date, depending on the latter's requirements. Clarification of requirements is needed before I can make recommendations for resolving the issues outlined above.

I can verify the fixes on my machine.
