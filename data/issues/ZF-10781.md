### Description

I would like to tell Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Provider\_DbTable::createFromDatabase which section of configuration to use when scaning the database. Maybe there is a way to configure zf.php (CLI)?

I have found that Zend\_Tool\_Project\_Context\_Zf\_BootstrapFile has a hardcoded application.ini section name in getApplicationInstance() to 'development' which is not allways what I want! It would be nice if I could tell the DbTable provider to use a specified section or take one from the .zf.ini file.
