ZF-383: Zend::loadClass() - unnecessary "include\_once" and change operator to strict

### Description

In Zend::loadClass() there is a call to self::loadFile($file, $dirs, true) which instructs the file containing the class to be loaded. It is not necessary to have the true as a parameter because at the beginning of the loadClass method there is already a check:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (class_exists($class, false)) {
        return;
    }


which would halt execution and avoid loading the file twice.

The other tweak is here on the second comparison operator:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if ($dirs === null && $path != $class) {


simply a change from != to !==

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

If a developer included the file previously using some method other than Zend::loadClass(), but the class was not brought into scope (i.e. class\_exists($class, false) === false), then making this change would erroneously include the file twice. Thus, this performance tweak would benefit nearly everyone, but in a rare edge case, the file would be included twice, instead of throwing the correct error ("File was loaded, but the class was not found within").

However, we might be able to add an additional option flag to the method signature:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    static public function loadClass($class, $dirs = null, $paranoid = false)
    .
    .
            self::loadFile($file, $dirs, $paranoid);
    .
    .


In order for such a change to be approved, someone must volunteer to write the unit tests. They are not hard, but we have many many tasks and deadlines for ZF 1.0. To volunteer unit tests, please see: <http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/cQo>
