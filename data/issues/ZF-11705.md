### Description

I would like to change the timeout setting when connecting to an SMTP server and sending a mail. At the moment this is a constant in the Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract class: const TIMEOUT\_CONNECTION = 30;

Would be nice to have an option to change this, because 30 seconds is too much for a LAN connection, and switching to a backup SMTP takes at least 30 seconds with this setting, which is too much.

I do not know if it is the good place to say that but I have got the same issue with Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract with const TIMEOUT\_CONNECTION = 30. The fact is not so much that 30 seconds are too long a time, the problem is that it should not be an unreachable constant imho.
