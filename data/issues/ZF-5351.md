### Description

Hello

Disable escaping for options items in Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect I've needed to fill dynamically a Select list with hierarchical categories. To indent each categories properly you must use "&nsbp;" As Zend\_View\_Helper\_FormSelect escape sistematicaly all options (see method \_build on line 148) you can draw properly a hierchical list

I confirm the issue. Is quite annoying on such cases...

Just ran into same issue again...

Now it simply strips my Japanese text from li !
