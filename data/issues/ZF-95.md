### Description

Alex, what are your thoughts on this one?

That would be nice to implement it. It doesn't depends from enything else because needs only post-processing of query result.

One additional comment. Non-default sorting may dramatically reduce query performance, because it needs full result set retrieving (constructing all documents from result set).

That's the same for Java Lucene with one exception. If Java application works in application server environment and stills running between requests, then documents retrieving is performed only once.
