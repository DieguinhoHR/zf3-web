### Description

i have found bugs when fetching uniqueidentifier data type using pdo\_mssql/pdo\_dblib "SELECT NEWID() AS GUUID" which always return null, but in sql\_srv work properly & i have tried too using mssql extension return binary char

temporary solution,we cast in select query so return always in varchar datatype

This behavior is caused by a bug in the underlying PDO\_DBLIB PHP extension.

I have posted a bug report and patch here [<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=54167>]. If you need an immediate fix, check out the php source, apply the patch and recompile the extension. Otherwise this fix will need to wait until the patch is committed to PHP.

Closing as "won't fix" since this is not a ZF or Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql issue but rather a PHP issue.
