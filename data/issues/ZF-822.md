### Description

The attached code is the first draft of an authentication adapter that implements a large part of RFC 2617. This adapter is based on the current incubator version of Zend\_Auth, not the new API recently proposed by Ralph Schindler, which is still under discussion.

The File Resolver in this code is pretty similar to the existing Digest adapter; we can discuss whether they ought to be merged or not.

I currently don't have any documentation demonstrating how to actually use this adapter in a real application. Its usage in my application is currently an ugly hack...

Yes, I agree that the file resolver (in combination with this adapter) would replace the existing Digest adapter.

[~gearhead] has an updated version that we should commit to the incubator as a first step.

This adapter has been promoted to core with SVN [r3874](http://framework.zend.com/fisheye/changelog/Zend_Framework/?cs=3874).
