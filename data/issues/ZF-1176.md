### Description

If you are reading this issue, we encourage you to vote for one of the options below in a comment to this issue, even if this issue is marked resolved. Feedback will help us adjust things to meet your needs with simpler solutions :)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require 'Date.php';
    date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Paris');
    $date = new Zend_Date('2007-10-01', Zend_Date::ISO_8601);
    
    echo 'Before : ' . $date->toString('yyyy-MM-dd'), "\n";
    $date->addMonth(1);
    echo 'After  : ' . $date->toString('yyyy-MM-dd'), "\n";     


Outputs

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Before : 2007-10-01
    After  : 2007-10-31


Currently, DST adjustments are the reason for the unexpected result above.

Also,

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date('31.Jan.2007');
    $date->addMonth(1);  // what calendar date should this be?
    $date->addMonth(1);  // what calendar date should this be?


Possible options include:

Combine getDateParts() with setTime() in userland solutions to provide the ability to add and subtract years, months, and days:
===============================================================================================================================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $date = new Zend_Date(mktime(0,0,0, $year, $month + $increment, $day));


The example above does not support 64 bit timestamps. Fortunately, we have Zend\_Date\_DateObect::getDateParts() already, and it supports 64 bit timestamps. Also, we already have Zend\_Date::setTime().

setting the day of the month to the end of the month or else addMonth(1) may actually increment the month by 2, if day of the month is larger than the total number of days in the next month
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function addMonths($monthsToAdd)
    {
        1. Calculate new month and year
        2. If current day greater than number of days in calculated
           month, set day to that value
        3. Get ISO-8601 string representation of date
        4. Replace year, month, and day in string
        5. Return new Zend_Date($dateString, Zend_Date::ISO_8601)
    }


if the result is a calendar date where the day of the month exceeds the number of days in the resulting month, throw an exception
=================================================================================================================================

if the result is a calendar date where the day of the month exceeds the number of days in the resulting month, ignore the problem and record / report the day unchanged (e.g. February 31)
==========================================================================================================================================================================================

removing the DST adjustment used for this (and other methods with similar unexpected results),
==============================================================================================

documenting why the result is different than what many developers will expect
=============================================================================

changing the name of the method to match its current behavior
=============================================================

forcing hours, minutes, and seconds to zero and day of month to 1 (i.e. truncating date timestamp to a simple calendar date)
============================================================================================================================

creating a new method that produces the results most will expect (does not answer the question: what do most users expect?)
===========================================================================================================================

adding a calendar property to Zend\_Date objects, indicating if the object should be treated like a calendar date (instead of a raw timestamp like currently done); such a property would enable Zend\_Date objects to work when:
=================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

``` so that the result is what most users expect (i.e. $date is incremented by exactly 3 months, regardless of DST and leap days, seconds, etc.). There are some options regarding what to do with the day of the month, hours, minutes, and seconds. We can document them below in comments.

adding a DST option to disable application of DST adjustments within Zend\_Date methods
=======================================================================================

remove addMonth() from Zend\_Date, and require developers to choose their own solution for adding months
========================================================================================================

Several of these options are quite impractical, if not impossible to implement within Zend\_Date. Some result in other problems or complications. However, I am trying to list _all_ options.

The most close to my opinion is #2. If I understand it correctly: 2007-10-01 + 1 month = 2007-11-01 2007-01-31 + 1 month = 2007-02-28 2007-01-31 + 2 month = 2007-03-31

 

 

Posted by AndrÃ© VIGNAUD (avignaud) on 2007-03-30T17:22:55.000+0000

I agree with Alexander. My vote goes to #2. For example, it's the way add\_month() run in Oracle PL/SQL. Also the actual function can be renamed (Option #7) and documentation should explain the differences between the 2 functions (option #6).

 

 

Posted by Laurent Melmoux (laurent melmoux) on 2007-03-31T03:11:01.000+0000

+1 for #2.

With MYSQL SELECT ADDDATE('2007-01-31', INTERVAL 1 MONTH) output 2007-02-28

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-03-31T04:58:43.000+0000

My opinion goes to a combined:

3, #4, #5, #6
=============

3 and #4 can be selectable per option
=====================================

13 Additionally we can remember the original value, which makes #4 possible to return the original day unchanged even if we concat the usage. This is a sort of #10 but not woth the negativ effects.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================

31.01.2007 +1 => 28.02.2007 +1 => 31.03.2007 +1 => 30.04.2007 +1 => 31.05.2007 But only if #3 is not activated... per option we could select between original #4 and #13 automatically fixing the last day as mentioned here. This would come nearly to what laurent mentioned in his second post.

To the other mentioned:

1 - is almost impossible because this function is related to several other function internaly within Zend\_Date.
================================================================================================================

2 - makes problems as soon as someone has 30.1. and does addMonth(10)... he will not get the 30.10 as expected but the 03.11.
=============================================================================================================================

7 brakes the API
================

8 brakes the object because it changes values it should not change
==================================================================

9 having 2 functions for the same behaviour is not userfriendly... better to have options to select the behaviour
=================================================================================================================

10 is not part of Zend\_Date because this is how Zend\_Calendar will work !, but with the combination of 3,4,5,6 we have a similar solution
===========================================================================================================================================

11 DST was deleted because it caused problems with how Zend\_Date internally works if the user changed the automatic value. This is impossible to implement.
============================================================================================================================================================

12 brakes the API
=================

@Alexander: A user having 30.01.2007 +2 months will always expect to get 30.03.2007 and not 03.04.2007 !!! Actually if you use 30.01.2007 + 2 months you will (or should) get 30.03.2007

With SVN 4295 I added a new option 'fix\_dst' which makes it possible to select if DST should be fixed or not.

Standard behaviour is to fix DST so the hour stays the same as before even if we have a change from summer to winter time or visa versa.

The commit is only a part of the issue above. So #5 is included and can be selected. The question is now how to behave on days greater 28.

After looking at other tools/libraries, I think MySQL's approach is common, even though adding 2 months to '2007-01-31' gives a different result than adding 1 month two times to '2007-01-31'. So far, all community members voted for #2.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-04-05T15:16:40.000+0000

Regarding #1, I continue to believe Zend\_Date should also provide the equivalent of getDateParts(), which is analgous to Zend\_Locale::getDate(), except works with Zend\_Date objects. Similarly, for the same reasons PHP includes a mktime() function, I think we should have a mkdate() equivalent for Zend\_Date/Zend\_Date\_DateObject.

If we provided these two functions, then developers could easily implement their own version of addMonth(), add\*(), \*Month(), etc.

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-04-05T15:59:43.000+0000

So we should not behave like PHP ? We change the behaviour of ZF to be not conform with PHP ? Actually using mktime(0,0,0,$day, $month+1, $year); gives the 03.03.2007 when adding one month to 31.01.2007. I thought compatibility to php is a must because of existing code...

Related to #2 itself... I see no reason to change the actual code which works and change it to something completly different... the way this function actualy works does more than only add a month number to the existing one.

The only not answered or discussed question is how to act for days extending a month. 31.1 -> xx.2

Related to #1 I see no reason to double the existing code. getDateParts() is not needed because when we are in userland and a user extends Zend\_Date he also can seperate the existing date part by using the toString(), toValue() or get() functions.

And I said several times to make mktime public but everytime I was siad that I should leave it protected. I'm quite confused in the intention... one time so... 2 weeks later the other way... then again so... and once again the other way...

And own addMonth() functions can easily be added by extending Zend\_Date... there is no need to add additional function because all what is needed is avaiable for this purpose.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-04-05T16:54:16.000+0000

Compatibility with PHP is not priority #1 for the ZF. Sometimes other priorities are more important, including easy-of-use, simplicity, consistency with other ZF components and other standards and practices. The community has voiced a clear preference to be consistent with other tools/languages that follow alternative #2.

I don't understand your comments relating to #2. Do you agree with the approach described in #2 in the issue description at the top of this page? The description under #2 (top of this page) does describe "how to act for days extending a month" - i.e. 2007-01-31 + 1 month.

Yes, a user can create a subclass of {Zend\_Date or Zend\_Date\_DateObject, but why make the user do this in order to gain access to getDateParts() or mktime()?

Regarding whether or not Zend\_Date\_DateObject::mktime() should be public, when have I ever said it should be private? I have only said public methods are held to a high standard for ease-of-use and should not fail silently on bad input (as stated in our coding standard document).

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-04-06T02:11:17.000+0000

So I should delete the existing solution which works and has not the mentioned problems related to DST... and include a solution which makes problems the way #2 is described and how the API currently works ?

I only asked for how to act with extended days f.e. Feb30... the way the API actual works is much more faster than what is described in #2.

So for clearification:

I will add the behaviour of changing the day to the last day of month if it overlaps to the next month... 30.Feb -> 28.Feb/29.Feb. But that's it.

Related to mktime... it's not private it's protected... so a user extending Zend\_Date has automatically access to this function within his extended class. We spoke about this 2 times and every time it was said that protected is better than public for mktime() and date() because only users extending Zend\_Date should have access to it. And a user which wants to make his own addMonth() or whatever function will always extend Zend\_Date.

Personally I see this as problematic because actualy we have functions and API which works with ISO and are easy... and making the functions of Zend\_Date\_DateObject would give access to functions which do not accept ISO but extend PHP's internal functions for the use of Zend\_Date itself.

These functions are meant to be changed as soon as we can be sure PHP supports the new date\_object. All of this functions within Zend\_Date\_DateObject will then change, but not the API of Zend\_Date itself... this will then make Zend\_Date much faster for dates extending 32bit.

Also users will expect that these functions are working the same way as PHP's own functions... and this is not true. I only added the parts which are needed for Zend\_Date to act properly.

2 is not mutually exclusive with the "fix\_dst" patch you already made. Why discuss this "DST" patch, when we are talking about #2? Let us continue to focus on the parts of the solution that are not yet done, instead of talking about "deleting existing solutions".
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Related to mktime, I was using the English word "private" in the general meaning, not

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    No, I raised issues with mktime() not performing adequate checking of its input to meet reasonable standards for a public method.  This only meant that mktime() needed additional checking to avoid silent failure on erroneous input.  You chose an alternative, of making mktime() 

, which largely eliminated the possibility of silent failure on erroneous input, since only Zend\_Date methods now call mktime().

When I helped with the proposal process and initial work, I did the initial research on the functions included in this PHP extension. 100% consistency with PHP at all cost is not the goal fo the ZF. Simplicity and ease-of-use often have very high priority in the ZF. Ideally, components are extremely simple to use and consistent with the expectations of developers and other ZF components. Often, compromises must be made.

I continue to believe that more of Zend\_Date\_DateObject should be exposed as part of the public API of Zend\_Date, including some way to decompose a date into an array of parts, and another way of assembling these parts back into a date, just like PHP's mktime(). Hiding this functionality so that developers are forced to extend these components does not protect against API change as much as we might hope, since developers then use the protected functions directly and are still affected by future changes in the distant future when PHP 6 becomes stable. I do not yet see a good reason for not including this functionality in the public API.

Gavin:

My problems are that I have solved the problem which has lead to this issue. Now we are discussing about thing which have nothing to do with this issue. And you are raising new ideas and throw them together with this issue.

You have made this several time in the past and this made me everytime headache. Because an issue is one issue and not one issue with 3 new ideas.

My english is not that good... I am not sure I understand what you meant with #2.

Again: Should I implement that adding/subbing months fix the day when this would lead to a other month f.e. 31 Feb to 28/29.Feb. Or should I change the actual implementation of adding values and do all like proposed within #2... Actually we are not doing steps 2-4 and the implementation works... only for the case I mentioned above I wanted to have an clearification what I shall do. Now 31.Feb leads to 03.March which is how Excel works f.e. . #2 describes implementation details on how Zend\_Date is NOT working actually. I only wanted to be sure that if I implement step2 this issue is fixed.

All other discussions have nothing to do with this issue and should be extracted to another issue or within the team or mailing list.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-04-06T13:06:42.000+0000

The issue is about addMonth() and how to implement it to provide behavior the community asked for. The DST patch did remove the unexpected subtraction and addition of an hour when using addMonth() to a date resulting in a date that crosses a DST boundary. However, this issue is about the behavior of addMonth(), and not merely about DST issues. Many options were presented and summarized in the issue description.

Ideas are discussed to determine the resolution for the desired behavior of addMonth(). Discussing these ideas in prematurely separated issues might have increased confusion among those following this issue. I have tried to capture all related implementation alternatives for a single method addMonth() in the description of this issue (top of the page) to make reviewing alternatives easier for the community.

However, I agree that discussions about option #1 (i.e. mktime() and getDateParts()) have matured enough to continue in a separate issue, if you believe a separate issue is needed. I continue to believe option #1 is also a reasonable solution, and [Excel has a similar example in its help documentation](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP030561121033.aspx). I think we can provide both options #1 and #2 simultaneously to increase the flexibility of the Zend\_Date API. Again, if you prefer we can continue discussion of option #1 in a separate issue.

{quote}Should I implement that adding/subbing months fix the day when this would lead to a other month f.e. 31 Feb to 28/29.Feb. Or should I change the actual implementation of adding values and do all like proposed within #2...{quote}

Ahhhh, I think I understand the reason for the confusion! When community members (and myself) have suggested "option #2", I think we mean only the _functional_ behavior described by alternative option #2 in the issue description above. The pseudocode in option #2 above is only meant to explain the desired behavior, and not restrict how to implement this behavior. The exact code and implementation in Zend\_Date could be different than the pseudocode shown in option #2, but still have the same results. If you add a patch that implements the described behavior of option #2, then you have implemented option #2: {quote}"setting the day of the month to the end of the month or else addMonth(1) may actually increment the month by 2, if day of the month is larger than the total number of days in the next month"{quote} You are the best person in the world for deciding the actual "how to code the implementation". I never meant to imply implementing option #2 in a particular way.

Also, I have no objections to supporting an option that selects either the "MySQL" way or the "Excel" way. Developers could use the option to select whether or not to "truncate" the day of the month to the last day of the month, when the day of the month resulting from the date operation (e.g. addMonth()) would be greater than the total number of days in the month. If such an option existed, then developers could choose if they want "2007-01-31 + 1 month = 2007-02-28" (MySQL way) or "2007-01-31 + 1 month = 2007-03-03" (Excel way).

As things seems to be cleared now this issue is fixed with SVN 4427.

Added new option 'extend\_month'. Defaults to false. (sql behaviour)

When 'extend\_month' => false is set the behaviour of adding/substracting months is like within sql. (31.2 will become 28/29.2) When set to true the behaviour is like in excel. (31.2 will become 3.3.)

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-04-08T16:57:07.000+0000

Excellent work Thomas :)

I think we have a good solution that satifies the needs of those who want any combination of DST, no DST, wraping or no wrapping of dates crossing month boundaries during month calculations.
