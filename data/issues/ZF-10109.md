### Description

It would be great if developers could add additional headers to existing, for example 'Content-Encoding: gzip' makes sense; so, if I extend the Zend\_Rest\_Server class, it's not possible, because in line 178 $this->\_headers = array('Content-Type: text/xml') will be declared as a new array; it would be better to push a variable to existing \_headers array, $this->\_headers[] = 'Content-Type: text/xml'

Like so, currently it's not possible to add additional headers; even better would be a public method addHeader($header);

In my case, I added json response type to the class and I had to rewrite the header functionalities;

cheers, stefan
