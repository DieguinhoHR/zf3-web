### Description

Below is the current function, basically the strtolower should be removed.

The reason is that I recently had to extend the select class and was defining a new part in the "protected static $\_partsInit" array. The definition corresponds to a rendering function and because the getPart() function converts the $part to lower case I have to define my render function as:

protected function \_renderSqlcalcfoundrows( $sql )

instead of the more readable

protected function \_renderSqlCalcFoundRows( $sql )

 
    /**
     * Get part of the structured information for the currect query.
     *
     * @param string $part
     * @return mixed
     * @throws Zend_Db_Select_Exception
     */
    public function getPart($part)
    {
        $part = strtolower($part);
        if (!array_key_exists($part, $this->_parts)) {
            require_once 'Zend/Db/Select/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Db_Select_Exception("Invalid Select part '$part'");
        }
        return $this->_parts[$part];
    }
