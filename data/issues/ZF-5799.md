ZF-5799: Zend\_Amf documentation of service namespaces
------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Docs: Problem Created: 2009-02-16T07:27:48.000+0000 Last Updated: 2012-11-20T20:53:24.000+0000 Status: Closed Fix version(s):

### Description

When adding multiple classes to a server, the documentation has the following to say about namespacing:

"You could also mix and match multiple classes and functions. When doing so, we suggest namespacing each to ensure that no method name collisions occur; this can be done by simply passing a second string argument to either addFunction() or setClass(): "

And later in the documentation is the following:

"When namespacing, you would use "myservice..": myservice.world.hello("Wade");"

This is either insufficient or incorrect information on how to get a remote object in Flex to use namespaces set up by the server. Just using myservice.. (with "" and "" replaced with correct values) results in a Flex Builder error:

ReferenceError: Error #1069: Property not found on mx.rpc.remoting.mxml.Operation and there is no default value.

I have run into this problem what is the proper way to do it? Currently I do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    myService.source = 'dvr';
    myService.edges();
