### Description

The constructor of WSDL has a bug where $this->\_uri is not properly saved. This leads to problems with complex types that rely on this information and inside the tag the namespace is empty. This did not came up in the unit tests, because they also expected the wrong result.

Attached is a very simple patch for both WSDL and WSDLTest classes that solves this issue.

Solves the $this->\_uri issue with two simple changes to the constructor.

Fixes the Unit Test that expects the wrong result. There are hundrets of whitespace changes in this patch too, since the WsdlTest was completly in DOS format.
