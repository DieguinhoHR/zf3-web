### Description

I am using Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Pop3 to read emails from the mailbox. I need to get from email address and to email address as there might be multiple user in to. I am just getting name not email address. When I see header from outlook and thunderbird it shows both name and email address. Suppose to contains XYZ [XYZ@domain.com](mailto:XYZ@domain.com), then i just get name only and when i see header from thunderbird it displays both email and name. So how to get email address from header.

Please post some code to demonstrate how you are getting the To: header contents

$mail = new Zend\_Mail\_Storage\_Pop3(array('host' => 'domain.com','user' => 'username','password' => 'password')); foreach ($mail as $message) {

 
            echo "From : " . $message->from;
            echo "<br />";
            echo "To : " . $message->to;
            echo "<br />";
            echo "From : ".$message->getHeader('from'); 
            echo "<br />";
            echo "To : ".$message->getHeader('to'); 
            echo "<br />";
    
            $header=$message->getHeaders(); 
            echo "Whole Header ";
            echo "<br />";
            print_r($header);
            echo "<br />";
            echo "<br />";
            foreach ($message->getHeaders() as $name => $value)
            {
                if (is_string($value))
                {
                    echo " $name: $value\n"; continue; 
                }
                foreach ($value as $entry)
                {
                    echo " $name: $entry\n";
                }
            }
    
    
        }


I tried all this ways but just getting only name from the "name[name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com)" not email address.

If you're using a browser to look at the output you might want to use htmlentities().

Not a bug.
