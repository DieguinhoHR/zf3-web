Where did you see that elseif is discouraged? It doesn't appear in our coding standards. Please reopen with more details if I'm missing something.

I think it is the last sentence here: B.4.6.1. If/Else/Elseif

> Use of the "elseif" construct is permitted but strongly discouraged in favor of the "else if" combination."
