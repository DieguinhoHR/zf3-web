### Description

In the last example of chapter 3.3 Basic Usage; it is shown that print\_r($identity); gives an array with the table row data.

First of all, $identity is not explained. Is it obtained with $identity = $result->getIdentity(); ?

Then, how do you obtain the table row data? When I do the same, I get

Zend\_Auth\_Result Object ( [\_code:protected] => 1 [\_identity:protected] => my\_username [\_messages:protected] => Array ( [0] => Authentication successful. ) )

Does the manual need an update, is there an issue or am I doing something wrong?

The documentation is messed up. Here is how to get the table row:

$result = $authAdapter->authenticate(); $identity = $authAdapter->getResultRowObject(); print\_r($identity);

Cannot seem to find the original issue's location in the manual. Perhaps its been fixed since the issue was posted.

[http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.adapter.dbtable.html)

If its still not clear, please reopen.
