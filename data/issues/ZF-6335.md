### Description

Current implementation need search to be performed it least once to fill matching terms structures (for wildcard, range and fuzzy query types).

So matching highlighting is index dependent (only terms from the index are actually highlighted for some query types)

It also has one significant disadvantage: index should be loaded before highlight operation.
