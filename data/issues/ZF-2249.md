Resetting release priority until it has been assigned to a release or closed. Also assigning to Davey Shafik for review.

It may not be ideal, but SimpleXML is sufficient in the majority of cases. If a user believes they need to improve performance, they may propose refactoring the extraction into a set of swappable classes for each option. Without additional justification for the change, there's really no compelling reason to implement this.
