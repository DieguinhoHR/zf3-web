ZF-846: Cache is not stored if the folder doesn't exist
-------------------------------------------------------

### Description

If 'cacheDir' folder doens't exist the cache isn't stored and code execution goes on without any notice or Exception.

IMHO, Zend\_Cache should create the directory itself or, at least, throw an Exception.
