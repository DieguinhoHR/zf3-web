### Description

We are using the Zend\_Extra repository and the Translate to do the translation based on the files from that repository. Whatever is set to "locale" he always translate to Italian. The instantiation code used is as follows:

$translateValidate = new Zend\_Translate( 'array', APPLICATION\_PATH . '/../library/Zend-Extra/resources/languages/', $locale, array('scan' => Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_DIRECTORY) );
