### Description

Maybe it could be possible, to access the unexpected status code found in Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Abstract::\_expect() it could be a good idea to return it via Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception as a code parameter ...

Hello, Eutychus. I have changed that \_expect() method recently, so I will be happy if You try new version 1.10.3 .

???

Maybe I am blind ...

If I look at the current \_expect() of the trunk I find:

{quote} /\*\* \* Parse server response for successful codes \* \* Read the response from the stream and check for expected return code. \* Throws a Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception if an unexpected code is returned. \* \* @param string|array $code One or more codes that indicate a successful response \* @throws Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception \* @return string Last line of response string \*/ protected function \_expect($code, $timeout = null) { $this->\_response = array(); $cmd = ''; $more = ''; $msg = ''; $errMsg = '';

 
        if (!is_array($code)) {
            $code = array($code);
        }
    
        do {
            $this->_response[] = $result = $this->_receive($timeout);
            list($cmd, $more, $msg) = preg_split('/([\s-]+)/', $result, 2, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);
    
            if ($errMsg !== '') {
                $errMsg .= ' ' . $msg;
            } elseif ($cmd === null || !in_array($cmd, $code)) {
                $errMsg =  $msg;
            }
    
        } while (strpos($more, '-') === 0); // The '-' message prefix indicates an information string instead of a response string.
    
        if ($errMsg !== '') {
            /**
             * @see Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception
             */
            require_once 'Zend/Mail/Protocol/Exception.php';
            throw new Zend_Mail_Protocol_Exception($errMsg);
        }
    
        return $msg;
    }


{quote}

The code returned by for example an SMTP Server is passed to Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception.

Fu\*\*

what happended to my quotation??

Whatever ...

The call of "throw new Zend\_Mail\_Protocol\_Exception($errMsg);" does not seem to me that there the for example Smtp Server result is passed to the Exception ...

Sorry, sadly, I can not understand difference between current output and the result that you expect it.

Maybe there is a missunderstanding on my side ... is there a way to receive the smtp status code if an email isn't property submitted?
