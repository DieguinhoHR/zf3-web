### Description

Zend\_Service\_Audioscrobbler tries to require "Zend/Service/Audioscrobbler/Exception.php" and throw Zend\_Service\_Audioscrobbler\_Exception which does not exist.

Suggested fix is to: - either require "Zend/Service/Exception.php" and throw Zend\_Service\_Exception; - or create "Zend/Service/Audioscrobbler/Exception.php".
