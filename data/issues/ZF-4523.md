ZF-4523: Zend\_Captcha requiring Zend\_View instead of Zend\_View\_Interface on render(): Breaks third party view adapters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Zend\_Captcha\_Adapter's default render() method signature is:

public function render(Zend\_View $view, $element = null);

However, when using a different view adapter for the Zend\_Framework (for example, Dwoo) a fatal error is thrown because an instance of an object that implements Zend\_View\_Interface but is not Zend\_View is passed. All render() methods should be:

public function render(Zend\_View\_Interface $view, $element = null);

Classes that need to be changed: Zend\_Captcha\_Adapter Zend\_Captcha\_Dumb Zend\_Captcha\_Figlet Zend\_Captcha\_Image Zend\_Captcha\_ReCaptcha
