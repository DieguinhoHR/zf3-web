ZF-6076: Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Base fails to setup pluginPaths && missing get\_class\_methods workaround
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I.

In setOptions() the setting of key "pluginPaths" fails since this key is lower case due to

Zend\_Application's setOptions lower casing on line 119.

code lines:

Zend\_Application on #119: $options = array\_change\_key\_case($options, CASE\_LOWER); Zend\_Application\_Bootstrap\_Base on #107: array\_key\_exists('pluginPaths', $options)

II.

In Bootstrap\_Base getClassResources() there is a workaround that in setOptions() is not.

Might cause confusion on older PHP with protected setters.

I've taken care of (I) in r14385.

As for (II), you're comparing apples to oranges. In setOptions(), we are grabbing the list of class methods in order to determine if a setter exists for a given option key -- in all such cases, the setter will be public, and get\_class\_methods() will correctly list them (note, too, that protected methods should, according to our CS, be prefixed with '\_' -- which would never match the criteria in setOptions() anyways). The get\_class\_methods() workaround in getClassResources() is due to the fact that we're explicitly looking for protected methods -- which get\_class\_methods() does not correctly return in some versions of PHP.

Thanks for the quick fix and correction on (II) ;)
