just a note, I am using a MySQL database.. the database has a size of 550mb (aprox).

If I change the configuration and point to a database with the same structure but with no more than 100mb everything works fine.

here is how I configure the adapter:

$pdoParams = array( PDO::MYSQL\_ATTR\_USE\_BUFFERED\_QUERY => true );

$params = array( 'host' => 'localhost', 'username' => 'root', 'password' => '', 'dbname' => 'test', 'driver\_options' => $pdoParams );

$db = Zend\_Db::factory('Pdo\_Mysql', $params); Zend\_Registry::set('db',$db);

It seems like you have other issues here, please reopen if you can identify this as a ZF issue.

In your code, you are not actually connecting to the database in question (you have not called getConnection() on the adapter or sent a query).
