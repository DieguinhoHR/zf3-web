### Description

I would like to use Zend\_Locale's default locale to set up Zend\_Currency in bootstrap. However Zend\_Currency is somehow missing '\_FI' ending from 'fi\_FI' giving the fatal error: 'No region found within the locale 'fi'' in [...]/Zend/Currency.php:548

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    resources.locale.default = "fi_FI"


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    protected function _initViewHelpers() {
        ...
        $this->bootstrap('locale');
        $locale = $this->getResources('locale');
        $currency = new Zend_Currency(null, $locale);
        Zend_Registry::set('Zend_Currency', $currency);
    }

Of course I can always use Zend\_Currency('fi\_FI'), but...

Closing as non-issue.

User can give language as locale in this case. Zend\_Currency must have a full qualified locale or a country to know the currency to use. The language itself is not enough.

{quote}User can give language as locale in this case.{quote} Meaning what? Zend\_Currency($locale) throws the same error. As you can see I have set region (country) for Zend\_Locale. ($locale is instance of Zend\_Locale)

When a user accesses your application and his browser sends "en" as locale, then you initiate Zend\_Currency with "en".

As I can see you did NOT set a region for Zend\_Locale. You just set a default locale, which means that this locale is used when your user does not send a locale.

In the case your user sends "en" as mentioned before the default locale IS NOT USED.

Ouh, of course. I just forgot this after I had tried to use this Zend\_Currency($locale->getDefault())... ok, maybe I have to parse that key from the array of default locale and use that as input.
