{quote} h2. Naming Conventions

h3. Abstractions Used in API (Class Interfaces)

When creating an API for use by application developers (as opposed to Zend Framework internal developers), if application developers must identify abstractions using a compound name, separate the names using underscores, not camelCase. For example, the name used for the MySQL PDO driver is 'pdo\_mysql', not 'pdoMysql'. When the developer uses a string, normalize it to lowercase. Where reasonable, add constants to support this (e.g. PDO\_MYSQL). {quote}

I only mention this because Andi asked me to make the same changes to the options of Zend\_Db last Summer.

I've been making camelCase option names in Zend\_Db and other places too. But I use UPPER\_CASE\_WITH\_UNDERSCORES for constant names. We should reconsider a policy that strings that form option names must follow a certain capitalization. I'll talk with Andi about this.

FYI, We had a long discussion last Summer and decided specifically to make option names case-insensitive. Most of the ZF seems to follow that standard already.
