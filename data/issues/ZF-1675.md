### Description

Line: 169

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapterName = 'Zend_Db_Adapter_' . str_replace(' ', '_' , ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', $adapterName)));


Just to use a different adapter class, do we have to extend the entire Zend\_Db class? How about changing the function signature to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public static function factory( $adapterName, array $config = array(), $adapterClass = 'Zend_Db_Adapter' )


Now the Line: 169 reads like so:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapterName = $adapterClass . '_' . str_replace(' ', '_' , ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', $adapterName)));


Or, better yet, like so (DELETE LINE 168):

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $adapterName = str_replace(' ', '_' , ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', strtolower( $adapterClass . '_' . $adapterName))));


The above obviously reduces the number of files and classes in the application.

The above change is backwards-compatible, too.

Another way to solve this without breaking the interface is to add the class namespace as an element in the options array:

Usage:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = Zend_Db::factory('MyAdapter', array(
        'username' => 'bill', // and other parameters
        'adapterNamespace' => 'MyClasses'
    );


Code in the Zend\_Db::factory() method:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (isset($config['adapterNamespace'])) {
        $namespace = $config['adapterNamespace'];
        unset($config['adapterNamespace']);
    } else {
        $namespace = 'Zend_Db_Adapter';
    }
    $adapterName = str_replace(' ', '_' , ucwords(str_replace('_', ' ', strtolower( $namespace . '_' . $adapterName))));


It is not obvious how this change reduces the number of classes in an application. In fact, it is a general rule that in almost every instance of stating that something is obvious, it is not.

The default is to use something like Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql class that comes with the framework by specifying 'pdo\_mysql' as the adapter name. If I subclass this adapter class with something like Widgets\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mysql, there is currently no way to use my class instead of the default framework class because 'Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_' namespace is prefixed to the adapter name in a hardcoded way. At present, I'm creating a subclass of Zend\_Db just to be able to use my adapter class which seems an overkill just to specify a different adapter class. The above change would elegantly offer the ability to use a different adapter class instead of the default and I don't need to use an extension of Zend\_Db either - I can use Zend\_Db straight and get rid of the subclass of Zend\_Db. It reduces one file and one class in the application.

However, your approach to using the options array for the namespace is more ideal :)

Please go ahead...

Thanks!

For what it's worth, you're right that currently there is no way to use the factory() method to instantiate your custom adapter classes outside the Zend\_Db\_Adapter namespace, but there is a way to use them:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $db = new Widgets_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql($config);


Using the factory() method is a convenience, but it is not required. It does make things handy, though, if you want to specify the adapter class in a config file for your application. I commonly do this:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $config = new Zend_Config_Ini(...);
    $db = Zend_Db::factory($config->database->adapter, $config->database->params->toArray());


This of course does not work for user-supplied adapters unless the factory method accepts an alternative adapter namespace. So I think this feature is a good one.
