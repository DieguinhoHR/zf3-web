### Description

It wasnt always the case, but since updating to a newer version of zend, I discovered that if my gdata calendar query does not have a current event when setFutureevents(true) then the following error is thrown: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Gdata\_App\_HttpException' with message 'Expected response code 200, got 400 Requested calendar must be specified with public visibility.

If I remove "setFutureevents" or fill in an event manually in the calendar for the current time, the event query runs just fine. Calendar is a public calendar.
