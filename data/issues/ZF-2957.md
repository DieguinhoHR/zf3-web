### Description

In Zend\_Form documentation, at 15.2.6:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!$form->isValid($_POST)) {
                // Failed validation; redisplay form
                $this->form = $form;
                return $this->render('form');
            }


I think it's:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
            if (!$form->isValid($_POST)) {
                // Failed validation; redisplay form
                $this->view->form = $form;
                return $this->render('form');
            }
