ZF-3278: Zend\_Filter\_StripTags balks on '>' in attributes
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The naive parser implementation of Zend\_Filter\_StripTags does not seem do do well with closing angle brackets ('>') in allowed attributes, stripping the attribute, instead of allowing it to pass through the filter.
