### Description

Activating the logger in Zend\_Cache is not very useful when trying to debug the backend IO.

Need more information about reading/writing cache on the following methods : load, save, clean and remove.

Something like $this->\_log("Zend\_Cache\_Core::load() / Reading cache (id=$id)"); in the appropriate method.
