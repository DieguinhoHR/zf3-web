### Description

According to the response to [ZF-11375](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-11375), Zend\_Feed and Zend\_Feed\_Builder are deprecated.

The first 8 subsections of the manual's Zend\_Feed section are about the deprecated functionality, and none of those pages appears to mention that the component is deprecated. There are also no @deprecated tags in the phpdoc for Zend\_Feed.

There should be some indication that Zend\_Feed is not being maintained and isn't a good choice for new code. Even simply moving the Zend\_Feed\_Writer and Zend\_Feed\_Reader sections to the front would be an improvement.

Zend\_Feed/Builder are not included in ZF2 - 1.11 is the final release carrying that code. Not sure we need note this on the manual (otherwise we'll be marking a LOT of pages). The reason for not fixing all issues at this very late stage is simply that we already have far better alternatives and it's not worth the risk of breaking BC unexpectedly at the end of ZF1 lifecycle (a very real risk given Zend\_Feed's somewhat simplistic approach which almost guarantees people are using workarounds that would break).

bq. ...not included in ZF2 - 1.11 is the final release carrying that code. Not sure we need note this on the manual (otherwise we'll be marking a LOT of pages).

If it's a sure thing that a component is going to disappear, and ZF1 already contains an alternative to it, it's only reasonable to indicate that to users, so they can make an informed decision when writing code now.

Clearly, there are going to be big changes all over the codebase, but alerting people to those changes in advance seems like a no-brainer.
