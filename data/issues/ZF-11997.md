ZF-11997: FormElement's validator is ignored if the field is not required and is blank

### Description

I add a validator to a not required form element. The validator asserts that some of form elements (series elements) have value. Therefore I add the validator to the last element of the series.

However, isValid method (/library/Zend/Form/Element.php) returns true immediately if the value is blank and the field is not required.

I think, in some cases, blank value still should be validated.

By marking the element as optional (i.e., not required), you're telling the validation chain that if no value is provided, then it validates -- in other words, it does not need to run any additional validators. Mark the element as required if you have validators that must be run.

If an element is marked as required, it should not be empty. In my case, sometimes empty value is accepted, and in other cases not.

I found a workaround (following), but this is ugly, and difference between "required" and "notAllowEmpty" is ambiguous.

 
    $elm->setAllowEmpty(false)
        ->setAutoInsertNotEmptyValidator(false)


Could be good solution?

Your use case is exactly why we have those settings.
