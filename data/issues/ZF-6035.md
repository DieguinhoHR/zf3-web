### Description

I have problem with CamelCaseController.php filenaming. I am using zend 1.7.3 patch1 on localhost with PHP Version 5.2.6, I have also live version on hosting. Everything works fine until hosting upgraded to PHP version 5.2.9. I think there is the problem. I have got my CamelCaseController.php but when i call example.com/camelcase/ i have this error: "Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher\_Exception' with message 'Invalid controller specified (...."

I try to invistigate where is the problem and after i renamed CamelCaseController.php to CamelcaseController.php everything works. I do not know if the problem is in php version but it is strange. Naming inside class does not matter, only file name seems to be problem, controller starts with: class CamelCaseController extends Zend\_Controller\_Action....

Please read the manual more carefully, in particular the following:

- [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.migration.html#zend.controller.migration.fromoneohtoonefive)
- [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.basics.html) (the note titled "Case Naming Conventions"

In short, CamelCasing should be referred on the URL via word-separators. As an example, the controller CamelCaseController will be reffered on the URL as "camel-case".
