### Description

Reproduce code:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $form = new Zend_Form();
    $form->addElements(array(
        'username' => 'text',
        'password' => 'text',
    ));
    $form->clearElements();
    echo $form;


Expected: XHTML form with no content.

Actual:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    PHP Warning:  Corruption detected in form; invalid key found in internal iterator in .../framework/library/Zend/Form.php on line 2125

calling $form->clearDisplayGroups() causes the same exception.
