ZF-2088: getLastQueryProfile doesn't show substituted values
------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: New Feature Created: 2007-10-19T10:15:27.000+0000 Last Updated: 2013-02-10T16:15:15.000+0000 Status: Open Fix version(s):

### Description

When called ->getLastQueryProfile() for an insert or update action in zend\_db, the output doesn't show the substituted variables. This limits the usefulness.

For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
           $data = array(
             'col1'        =>  'test',
             'col2'         =>  'test2',
             'col3'        =>  'test3',
         );
            $db->insert('test_table',$data);
    
    $query=$profiler->getLastQueryProfile();
    echo $query->getQuery();


Output is:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
     INSERT INTO `test_table` (`col1`, `col2`, `col3`) VALUES (?, ?, ?)


Looking at this, there is no way to know what values were sent in the statement

It is possible to get the values by using ->getQueryParams()

It would be nice though to have a way of getting the merged SQL string.

This issue should have been fixed for the 1.5 release.

Please categorize/fix as needed.

This doesn't appear to have been fixed in 1.5.0. Please update if this is not correct.

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db
