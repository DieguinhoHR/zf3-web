### Description

Hi,

I have a function which has if condition like this if (@!class\_exists($className)) { return new static::$\_service($module); } else { return $className::getInstance($module); }

and i have written code(testcase) for phpunit that will check the function and when the control goes to class\_exists($className), it redirects to zend autoloader function which is fine, but when it goes to Loadfile function in loader.php, it tries to include the file that doesnot exist and gives the error.This way my phpunit tetscase fails.if class doestn't exist then it should go to 'return new static::$\_service($module);' as per code.

Please suggest anything to get rid of this.

I am using zendstudio 8.1, zendframework 1.11

I'm closing this as it appears to be a support request, and not specifically an issue with any zend framework component's functionality.

Please ensure the autoloader is set up correctly to do its job.

For support, please use either the mailing lists, or #zftalk on freenode IRC.
