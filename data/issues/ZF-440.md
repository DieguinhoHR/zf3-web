### Description

Hi, I am having trouble getting the zend luvene search to work. The demo works fine for the indexing of '<http://feeds.feedburner.com/ZendDeveloperZone>. However when I try another simple set up for indexing and searching it failed

Example 1: (Taken from some posting on another websites. Works for the developer but does not work for me

Creating index:

 <? require\_once 'Zend/Feed.php'; require\_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php'; $index = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene('/tmp/indexnew', true); $doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document(); $data = " A field name is used to search by default. It's good idea to place main document data into this field with this name."; $id = "22222"; $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Keyword('id', $id)); $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Text('contents', $data)); $index->addDocument($doc); $doc = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Document(); $data = " Phrase Queries are very flexible and allow to search exact phrases as well as sloppy phrases 345."; $id = "1111111"; $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Keyword('id', $id)); $doc->addField(Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Field::Text('contents', $data)); $index->addDocument($doc); $index->commit(); ?> Searching index:

 <?php require\_once 'Zend/Search/Lucene.php'; echo "required"; $index = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene('/tmp/indexnew'); echo "Index contains {$index->count()} documents.\\n"; $query = "default"; $hits = $index->find(strtolower($query)); echo "Search for \\"$query\\" returned " .count($hits). " hits.\\n\\n"; foreach ($hits as $hit) { echo str\_repeat('-', 80) . "--  
"; echo 'ID: ' . $hit->id ."  
"; echo 'Score: ' . sprintf('%.2f', $hit->score) ."  
"; $document = $hit->getDocument(); echo "id--".$document->getFieldValue('id'); echo "".$document->getFieldValue('contents'); } ?> This returns 0 hits. I don;t know if I am doing anything wrong and don;t see a reason why this wouldn't work.... Please help!!!

I ahve also tried downloading the index and searching it using Luke and it returns the appropriate results with 1 hit. Please let me know if there is anything I can look for or try to make this work.

I am seeing similar problems in 0.1.4, 0.1.5 and ZendFramework-20061017-1277 (the three versions I've tried). Searches work properly with Luke, but return no results in even the simplest test cases I know how to construct. I've attached a sample indexer, search and the lucene index files of my test case.

Simple test case demonstrating 0 results on apparently valid dataset.

I am unable to download your attachment. It shows up blank when I unzip it. Am I doing something wrong?

First zip file was empty. Please try this one instead. Apologies!

Hi Alan, I tried you set of files too and it wouldn't work for me. Sadly this is becomming very unpredictable. I have some other tests that work intermittently.

Changing fix version to 0.6.0.

The problem is that dictionary header entry field number was treated as 0xFFFFFFFF (4294967295) instead of -1. I's a special case for 64-bit platforms.
