### Description

In Zend\_Controller\_Front, the setControllerDirectory method does not have the @return PHPDoc tag. There should be a "@return Zend\_Controller\_Front" line added to this function's phpDoc block.

Very minor issue, but working with Zend Studio, you feel it immidiately ;)

A patch is attached.

I've added an @return self tag; does this work with Studio? If not, I'll revise in all instances.

Tested in Studio, appears to work fine.
