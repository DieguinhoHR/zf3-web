### Description

last version from /trunk

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $bbcode = Zend_Markup::factory('Bbcode', 'Html', array('encoding' => 'windows-1251'));
    
    $a = '
    [h3]Foo:[/h3]
    [list]
        [*] [url="request.html"]Request[/url]
        [*] [url="settings.html"]Settings[/url]
        [*] [url="database.html"]Database[/url]
        [*] [url="paginator.html"]Paginator[/url]
        [*] [s]Cache[/s] in process
        [*] Additional functions
    [/list]
    ';
    $b = $bbcode->render($a);
    var_dump($a, $b);
    exit;


 
    <pre class="highlight">
    string(259) "
    [h3]Foo:[/h3]
    [list]
        [*] [url="request.html"]Request[/url]
        [*] [url="settings.html"]Settings[/url]
        [*] [url="database.html"]Database[/url]
        [*] [url="paginator.html"]Paginator[/url]
        [*] [s]Cache[/s] in process
        [*] Additional functions
    [/list]
    "
    string(343) "<br></br>

### `Foo:`

`<br></br>`     <a href="http://request.html">Paginator</a> <del>Cache</del> in process Additional functions<br></br>
    "

1) why "http://request.html"? I don't need absolute url, relative needed 2) generated markup isn't readable because it printed in one string 3) generated markup isn't correct

I think that problem appears because url wrapped with quotes. But some links need this wrapping.

Imho is point 2 bogus. This component isn't meant to beautify HTML, it's meant to output that (at least this renderer is).

Maybe. But sometimes it useful for debugging.

Also relative path needed for anchor links [url=#title1]title1[/url]

ps: sorry for horisontal scroll-bar)

The default URL tag doesn't use relative URL's at all, all URL's are handled as absolute URL's by default.

This behaviour seems to be caused by the fact that the first " is found, but it only uses the last ". Its not really correct behaviour, and I'm going to fix it ASAP.

Also, if you want something that is useful for debugging, do something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">$parser = $bbcode->getParser();
    
    var_dump($parser->parse('[b]test[/b]'));

Thats much more useful than the output itself.

Added a unit test with a simplified usecase for this.
