### Description

It seems that the Zend\_Form\_Element\_File only works if an file is actually uploaded. If not validation of within Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract throws an exception in the ->\_getFiles() method, because it could not find any files related to the respective form element. The ->\_getFiles() method provides a third argument which could be used to block the exception. This argument however is not used by the calling ->isValid() method.

Have you verified with the latest release ? I am not able to reproduce this problem.

Please give your code to see the problem. I expect a handling problem.

The problem seems to be the java-script form submission library used which dynamically changes the submission mode based on the form values given. I am really sorry to have trespassed on your time by posting a non-existant bug prematurely. Is there a way for me to delete this issue?
