### Description

Well the Docs and in infomations regarding xmlrpc seems to be outdated. By following the docs only ZF v1.6 will let me have success. E.g. type base64, missing infomation for usage, missing unit test and it only work until release1.6 :-/ maybe some one can go through it and fix it. with this it do not make me feel to use even it's a good implementation.

Thank you very much for the bugreport. The documentation in standard-trunk has been updated to cover the latest additions of the Zend\_XmlRpc\_\* package. Please let me know, if I missed anything. Again, thanks for report and helping us to make Zend Framework better.
