### Description

How can we use the second parameter in function filterName to allow brackets in formElement's name?

Code is: Line 415 - Line 440 public function filterName($value, $allowBrackets = false) { $charset = '^a-zA-Z0-9\_\\x7f-\\xff'; if ($allowBrackets) { $charset .= '[]'; } return preg\_replace('/[' . $charset . ']/', '', (string) $value); }

 
    public function setName($name)
    {
        $name = $this->filterName($name);


..... }

Please ask questions like this on one of the mailing lists prior to submitting a ticket next time.

Element names cannot have brackets. However, if the element is marked as an array (setIsArray(true)), then brackets will be appended to the name when rendered.
