### Description

Many users expect to see isDate() or checkDate() as methods of Zend\_Date. For reasons not immediately obvious, isDate() exists in Zend\_Locale\_Format, but has more and different functionality and features than common to typical "isDate" functions. There is a real need for an extremely simple "isDate"/"checkDate" function in Zend\_Date.

Since Zend\_Date supports year values far beyond many other PHP functions, we may not be able to use <http://www.php.net/checkdate> (I have not tested with extreme values).

In order to answer the question "isDate($dateString)", we must decide what kinds of input are accepted for $dateString. Since Zend\_Date objects can not be constructed from invalid dates, allowing instances of Zend\_Date as input does not make sense. Thus, functions supporting "isDate" / "checkDate" must be static methods.

The $dateString must be normalized. Date parts must be extracted from the normalized string. Then the parts must be checked for completeness and validity. For example:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $parts = Zend_Date::getDateParts($date, $format = null, $locale = null);
    
    echo Zend_Date::checkDateParts($parts) ? 'date is valid' : 'date is not valid';
    
    // checkDate() could combine the two steps above:
    echo Zend_Date::checkDate($date, $format = null, $locale = null) ? 'date is valid' : 'date is not valid';

We should continue to discuss this _before_ committing a patch to trunk.

So, I am still hoping for community feedback about "intuitive" functionality for:

Zend\_Date::isDate() Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() Zend\_Date::checkDateParts() Zend\_Date::checkDate() etc.

For example, what would you expect the functions above to do, without reading any API docs?

Things to consider include how to check date strings for calendar validity (i.e. April 41st is not a valid date in any year), and how to check if a given date string matches a given date format.

For example, the following code returns "true":

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    var_dump(Zend_Locale_Format::isDate('April 41st', array('date_format' => 'MMMM-dd', 'locale' => 'en_US')));

As mentioned in another issue:

Zend\_Locale\_Format parses inputs and can only normalize and localize. So a isDate function within Zend\_Locale\_Format only returns if the given localized string contains all wished date parts...

But as this class has not to know what a date is and how it works, it would never give false on dates which are no strict dates as 30. February for example.

Zend\_Date is the only class which has the possibility and the logic background to verify the content of dates.

Related to the other things mentioned here I will give feedback as soon as I have time to think of the related API changes... latest end of this week.

There is a consistency issue, if Zend\_Date::isDate() checks the validity of a date, but Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() checks if the input matches a format string.

Perhaps Zend\_Locale\_Format::isDate() => Zend\_Locale\_Format::dateMatchesFormat() ?

Zend\_Locale\_Format::containsDate ;-) instead of dateMatchesFormat.

Related to function names:

Zend\_Date::isDate -> would check if the string contains a complete date...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::isDate('20.April'); -> FALSE because year is missing
    Zend_Date::isDate('20.April.2007'); -> TRUE
    Zend_Date::isDate('30.02.2007'); -> TRUE because it does not validate the input
    Zend_Date::isDate('20.April.2007 10:20:30'); -> TRUE... time is additionally given


Zend\_Date::checkDate -> would validate the string

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Date::checkDate('20.April.2007') -> TRUE
    Zend_Date::checkDate('30.02.2007') -> FALSE because this date does not exist


More functions are not needed or only internal and private

-1 for "containsDate".

How about "checkFormat()" or "isDateFormat()" for checking if a date string matches a date format? I think this function should be capable of checking whether the date string matches any basic self-defined date format, regardless of whether or not the date string contains a year or seconds (for example) _OR_ we could reduce our goal/functionality and only check whether a date matches the default format for the user-specified locale. Usually, I would want to combine date format validation with normalization and creation of a Zend\_Date object, where the result is "false" if the input date string failed to match the selected date format _or_ failed to match a valid calendar date _or_ failed to match a valid clock time. ``` $date = Zend\_Date::getValidDate('25:59:59', 'H:m:s'

How about "isDate()" for determining if a date string is a valid date - i.e. same as checkdate()?

In general, the ZF gives preference to using "is_()" for methods returning true or false, but it is difficult to find a good "is_()" name for checking the format of a data string.

Keep in mind that we are speaking here of two different classes...

Related to Zend\_Locale\_Format:

The function should not be named checkFormat because we have 2 formats... date and number... maybe in future even more (scientific, percentage...). Then the user would not know which localized format would be checked...

"checkDateFormat()" would be much better.

isDateFormat() would in my eyes mean, if the given format is a date format... this is not what we want to check ;-) The function has to check if all given date and or time parts from the format are present in the given string and if the position is correct... it should also be possible for the user to give a self defined format as it is already supported. But Zend\_Locale\_Format would only return the found and corrected date parts which are of course normalized... this is the general behaviour of this class... to normalize input. Creation of Zend\_Date objects is part of Zend\_Date... Zend\_Locale\_Format is only the normalization/localization part of Zend\_Locale.

Related to Zend\_Date: Zend\_Date itself will call Zend\_Locale\_Format internally to receive the normalized values from the given date as it is done already.

Wouldn't it be better to have Zend\_Date::isDate() and Zend\_Date::isValidDate() ? Or do we really want to eliminate the possibility of checking non-conform dates/times like "30.Feb.1400" ?

getValidDate() is useless because you would probably use $date = new Zend\_Date('23:59:59', 'HH:mm:ss'); instead for creating a date.

{quote}Wouldn't it be better to have Zend\_Date::isDate() and Zend\_Date::isValidDate() ?{quote}

I believe many users would find this very confusing, because they sound like they do the same thing.

I think checkDateFormat() is an acceptable name for a method that compares date strings against date format strings.

Regarding getValidDate(), yes, what you said was exactly the message I was trying to say. However, there is one key difference. When trying to determine if a given date string is valid, often automatic date correction/fixing is not wanted.

Zend\_Locale\_Format:

Ok... Agreed... "isDate()" will be changed to "checkDateFormat()" "isTime()" will be integrated into "checkDateFormat()"

checkDateFormat gives true if all given date parts can be parsed / found... otherwise false will be returned.

Zend\_Date:

Then let's degrade... Zend\_Date::isDate() will only check on valid dates. Invalid dates can be checked with Zend\_Locale\_Format.

 

 

Posted by Gavin (gavin) on 2007-03-21T16:51:04.000+0000

Yes, sounds good.

I do not see a reason to provide checkDateFormat() within Zend\_Date, and Zend\_Date::isDate() can perform date validation just like PHP's checkdate().
