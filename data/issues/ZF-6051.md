ZF-6051: Zend\_Cache compressing output
---------------------------------------

### Description

When you cache some html, css, javascript data, you store them as they were created : with spaces, comments, new and empty lines, very long names for css classes or javascript's variables. I think we can improve Zend\_Cache : we should be able to compress cached data. I don't think about gzip, but for example, something like Dojo Shrinksafe for javascript : - delete unneeded spaces and lines - delete comments - change size of variable

AFAIK the best compressor for CSS/JS is YUI -> <http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/>

Hello,

This is some new code to add to ZF. It extends ZF\_Cache in order to compress data. A doc file explains how it works.

I hope it can be integrated to a next ZF release.

Regards.

I find the 2 proposals here;

1. Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_Compression [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Cache_Backend_Compression+-+Maxime+Varinard)
2. Zend\_Compress [http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/…](http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Compress+Proposal+-+Steven+Brown)
