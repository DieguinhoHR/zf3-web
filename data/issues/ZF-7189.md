ZF-7189: Zend\_Db\_Select::assemble will return null or string.

### Description

The documentation lists string as return type for Zend\_Db\_Select::assemble(). However, when calling assemble on a vanilla Zend\_Db\_Select object, the return value will be null. This is due to \_renderColumns() returning null when there is no columns set in the \_parts array and all other \_render\* methods returning the $sql param untouched. The API docs could be improved to list string|null as return type for assemble() to reflect that.

With PHPUnit: $statement = new Zend\_Db\_Select; $sql = $statement->assemble(); $this->assertTrue(is\_string($sql)); will fail.
