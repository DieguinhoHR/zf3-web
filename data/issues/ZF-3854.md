I can merge over the demo, library and tests to the trunk and 1.6 release branch.

You should probably do the Documentation to ensure it will fit into the overall flow properly.

Should I delete the code out of the incubator as I merge it?

All artifacts merged to trunk and 1.6 release branch and removed from incubator.
