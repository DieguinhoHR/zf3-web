ZF-9081: setValue not working when using Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_FilteringSelect with Dojo Autocomplete

### Description

When using a Zend\_Dojo\_Form\_Element\_Filteringselect one has two methods of passing options to the selectbox. Option one is by semi-statically loading them at initialisationtime (providing the option multiOptions to the constructor or use setMultiOptions), the other option is connection a Dojo Data store to the element from which the options are fetched when an action is performed on the element (eg typing some text or clicking the "pulldown"-button).

When using the first option, the setValue method can be used to prepopulate the box with a certain value.

In case of option number two, setValue doesnt work as expected. The value is correctly set in the html input element, but the datastore is never queried to fetch the corresponding value, so the element appears empty.

This behaviour makes the datastore connection unusable for db updates on records and is also inconsistent with the documented behaviour.

This emaillog also describes the same problem: [http://mail-archive.com/fw-general@lists.zend.com/â€¦](http://www.mail-archive.com/fw-general@lists.zend.com/msg16883.html)

There might be a relation with: <http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-8546>

I finally had some spare time left to dive into this problem, and as a result managed to solve it. Or, perhaps better, managed to find the flaws in my own assumptions about the inner workings of this very useful piece of code.

What happens is as follows:

When normally entering text in an autocomplete field, a query is performed on the value part of the entry (ie: ), but on loading the initial selectlike entry, this part is not used, instead, in your autocompletecontroller, you have to catch an "id' GET variable and handle that in your db.

Now this functionality works beautifully in my app.

If this could be clafiried in the docs, i for one would be very grateful.
