### Description

If an option is set to null, reset it from the route.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    // So instead of  this
    $this->view->url(array('action'=>'edit', 'controller'=>'crud', 'module'=>'users'), null, true );
    
    // we could do that
    $this->view->url(array('action'=>'edit', 'page'=>null));


This modification should occur in Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route

It should work as you expect it to. There was a simple bug which broke this functionality. It is described in the other linked-to issue.
