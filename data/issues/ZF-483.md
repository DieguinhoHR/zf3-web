### Description

Wouldn't it be better to set the frontend and backend types in the parameter arrays themselves? Then you could simply have two parameters, not four:

```

You might use "type" as the array key for Core, File, etc.

I won't change the API for a question of taste :)

The syntax with 4 parameters is more clear for me

Fair enough. ;) Just a suggestion.

Bookkeeping. Closing old issues and assigning them to the person who ultimately resolved the issue.
