ZF-5423: JQuery View Helper add setUiLocalPathTheme() method

### Description

Would it be possible to add a method to set a local path theme for UI component ? \\ Then the specified style sheet will be added if uiIsEnabled()

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $this->jQuery()->setUiLocalPathTheme('ui/themes/mytheme/theme.ui.css')


One of the benefit would be the possibility to defined the theme in the bootstrap and style sheet will be automatically included if needed.

It seems that i am very forgetful. This functionality is already included through the following method

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $view->jQuery()->addStylesheet()

**jQuery()->addStylesheet()** will include a css file regardless if ui is enable or not. What I'm proposing is a method to setup the css theme and this one would be included with <?= $view->jQuery() ?> only if ui is enable. Even better, it should be included only if we are using any widget. What do you think ?

Ah ok i understand your issue :-)

There is currently no detection mechanism wheater a widget was loaded or not. What i propose you could use in your case, in the layout do:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php if($this->jQuery()->uiIsEnabled()): ?>
    
    <?php endif; ?>


I dont know if yet another method in the container is a good idea, since there is already this solution to the problem.

I did not think about this trick, thanks :).  
 IMHO, an other method would make it a bit more elegant, as all the setup could be centralized in the bootstrap. But this probably need a bit more thinking to fit in a bigger picture with theme and widget.

I agree I think this would be a good idea, or to set the base path for the skin $this->jQuery()->setUiLocalPathTheme('ui/themes/mytheme/')

Then each element would require it's own stylesheet, the skins seem pretty robust now so it wouldn't be too hard to automatically call the specific stylesheets and it would make setup much easier!
