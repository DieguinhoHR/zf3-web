### Description

Currently Zend\_Locale, Zend\_Translate use two codes to recognize language, but the traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese both are using 'zh' to be their language code.

If use only two codes to recognize, we can not recognize traditional or simplified Chinese successfully.

zh is the unicode definition for "chinese"...

The region code is added after the language. You can refer to the ZF docu for how this works.

zh\_TW for example means chinese language, region taiwan.

You can already use this sort of locales with Zend\_Locale and also with Zend\_Translate. There is nothing which has to be changed for this.

But wether the language nor the region include which script the user wants. This has nothing to do with language or region.

We will not change the CLDR library as this is legal property of unicode.

Actually the best way for you is, to make two translations, one for trad, one for simple and assign them to two different locales. f.e. zh\_TW = trad, zh\_MO = simp...

As long as scripts are not part of the locale there is no way to do this the way you proposed.

But in ZF Zend\_Translate docs it describes used only the language code for language selection. In that case, can not recognize trad or simple language file to use.

You are able to define full locales for Zend\_Translate.

"zh\_TW" or "zh\_CN" is also possible as the abbreviated "zh". Mostly it's enough to define only the language...

For example in german it's enough to define "de" because "de\_AT" and "de\_DE" use the same script.

When you have a constallation as you described it, it would be best to use as the region as selection criteria. This is already possible with Zend\_Translate.

Assigning to [~thomas]. Is this a non-issue, or what action should we take to remedy the problem, which remains a bit unclear to me?

Chen want to define something like this...

Zend\_Locale(array('zh', 'Traditional'));

But this is not possible with cldr.

Actually the I18N core does not support to have one locale with multiple scripts defined. The script is independend from the locale.

He has to define the region additionally to the language and make two translations, one for traditional and one for simplified as described in my post above.

For example... zh\_CN (chinese-china) for traditional and zh\_TW (chinese-taiwan) for simplified. He would have to make a selection for the user between simplified and traditional and redirect to the above specified locales.

Locales do not include scripts. But the description of the header of this issue is already possible.

In my eyes this is no issue for Zend\_Translate nor for Zend\_Locale. Scripts are no locales... these are 2 seperated types of informations.

I will wait a few days if the thing is clear for Chen... if no additional problems occur (the mentioned way from above should already work) I will close this issue as "no issue".

    <pre class="highlight">
    $trans = new Zend_Translate("gettext", 'locale\messages.mo', "en");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.cn', "zh");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.tw', "zh");


If the language file use only language code 'zh' to define, then how does Zend\_Translate know how to determine which language to use if remote user uses one of Chinese language ?

 

 

Posted by Thomas Weidner (thomas) on 2007-09-27T01:04:06.000+0000

As I said you have to use also the region...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $trans = new Zend_Translate("gettext", 'locale\messages.mo', "en");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.cn', "zh");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.tw', "zh_TW");


This way "zh\_TW" would be traditional. "zh" would be simplified.

If a messageid in traditional is not translated it would fall down to simplified. If the messageid is also not translated in zh it would fall down to en and be displayed.

If you dont want to fall down from traditional to simplified just change "zh" to be "zh\_CN"...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $trans = new Zend_Translate("gettext", 'locale\messages.mo', "en");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.cn', "zh_CN");
    $trans->addTranslation('locale\messages.tw', "zh_TW");


This way if a messageid is not translated it falls always down to "en".

How the fallback mechanism works is described in the docu for Zend\_Translate. How Locales work is described in the docu for Zend\_Locale. And which locales exist is described in the last two chapters of Zend\_Locale.
