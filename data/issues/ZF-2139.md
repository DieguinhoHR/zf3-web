Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

I see that some work has been completed on this, how much more work does it need to be completed?

Hi, I am planing an placing different pages from one document to single page in another document (imposition). Since Zend\_Pdf\_Page is an Canvas element I was hoping to do use $page->drawCanvas() but looks like page is missing the getContents() implementation.

Anyway, what I am asking is whether I am on the right track here and its just a matter of time till it is available or if that sort of requirement is not addressed here.

thanks for your help
