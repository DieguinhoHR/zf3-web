The problem is on line 126 of Zend/Tool/Project/Provider/Abstract.php:

$projectDirectoryAssembled = DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR . implode(DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);

On Windows, this creates a $projectDirectoryAssembled of \\C:\\www\\mytest for me!

Clearly the leading \\ is wrong for Windows. Suggested patch:

Hi sorry but i've just do a fresh checkout (r17563) and tried zf.bat on windows XP and it didn't worked for me :

i had to edit Abstract.php on line 126 like this to make it work

 
            $projectDirectoryAssembled = implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);


regards

I just checked out 1.9.1 from subversion, and this bug is still there. The second fix above works for me, but I do get the following (php 5.3.0) due to the use of the split()

Deprecated: Function split() is deprecated in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\ZendServer\\share\\ZendFramework\\library\\Zend\\Tool\\Project\\Provider\\Abstract.php on line 124

thanks!

Same here. Just checked the 1.9.1 SVN. In abstract.php (Revision 17521) it should be fixed but still doesn't work for me.

This worked for me:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if (DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR == "\\") {
        $projectDirectoryAssembled = implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);
        } else {
        $projectDirectoryAssembled = DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . implode(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $parentDirectoriesArray);
    }


inserted at line 127.

thanks!

I'm working on ZF1.9.1 and Zend Studio 7.0. Both ZF 1.9.1 and ZS 7.0's Zend\_Tool is not working properly. I cannot create neither controller nor action. Therefore ZS 7.0's code autocompletion has become maybe 5 times slower and has too many bugs like alpha or beta build.

 

 

Posted by Murad Jamal (unpresedented) on 2009-08-18T04:54:16.000+0000

here's the error message i get:

 A project profile was not found.

what the hell is this ? i tried all the solutions you wrote, but without any effect ...

 

 

Posted by Rob Kunkle (goodlux) on 2009-08-18T09:34:49.000+0000

Hi Murad -

The problem is that you need to be in the project directory when you run zf create action...otherwise zf can't find the project profile

cd c:\\apache\\htdocs\\

zf create project myproject

cd C:\\apache\\htdocs\\myproject\\

then

zf create controller blah blah

- - - - - -

Is there any way to reopen this bug to get the source code fixed?

Hi Rob, i tried exactly what you told me without any benefit :( from inside my zend studio 7, i opened Zend Tool, typed cd C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\project1 but it gives me the following error:

cd C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\project1 Error resolving path: cd C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\project1, specify an existing ZF project. Error resolving path: cd C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\project1, specify an existing ZF project. ok (took 0:00.000) Error: Error resolving path: cd C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\project1, specify an existing ZF project.

although there was an existing zend framework project in that directory ... this is so weird ? anyone can help me please ?

I have with ZF 1.9.1 the same problem like in the description at the top.

The following code doesn't work: zf create project test => OK - cd test - zf create controller guestbook => Error!

With ZF 1.8.4 Patch 1 the code works.

 

 

Posted by Ralph Schindler (ralph) on 2009-08-24T12:07:21.000+0000

Please see ZF-7607, a fix as been put in place in trunk and release 1.9 branch that fixes this issue.

You are getting this error

An Error Has Occurred A project profile was not found.

Zend Framework Command Line Console Tool v1.9.0a1 Details for action "Create" and provider "Controller" Controller zf create controller name index-action-included[=1] module

Solution : You are trying to run the ZF in wrong place.

Go to your project > application directory > Controller and then type

zf create controller foo
