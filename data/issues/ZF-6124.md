### Description

Two problems when working with CLI:

The colour codes in Zend\_Tool\_Framework are hardcoded and assume the user has a white on black scheme.
========================================================================================================

The colours fail on my Mac OS X when in ' ' but work fine with " "
==================================================================

(so "\\033[32m" makes green, whereas '\\033[32m' is just printed that way)

It would be great to set those to a custom value. (maybe through the registry which is offen present when appending content to the response object)
