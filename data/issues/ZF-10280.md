ZF-10280: Turn off auto conversion to google docs
-------------------------------------------------

### Description

Steps to reproduce issue: 1. I created a php page (with zend framework) which copies an html page from php server to google docs 2. The code that transfers the document is as follows: $gdClient = new Zend\_Gdata\_Docs($httpClient); $fileToUpload = $ourFileName; $newDocumentEntry = $gdClient->uploadFile($fileToUpload,$fileToUpload,'text/html',Zend\_Gdata\_Docs::DOCUMENTS\_LIST\_FEED\_URI);

Expected output: The html file should be copied without being converted to a google document. I should be able to open the html file as a webpage not a text file.

Actual results: Currently, when the html file gets copied, it shows up as a word doc or text file. How do I turn off the auto convert?

Please suggest.

Sriram
