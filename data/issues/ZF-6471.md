### Description

If a Resource set\* function is called through it's constructor and the Resource depends on another Resource (e.g. View) there is no way to get it. setBootstrap is called after construction of the resource so there is no way to get other resources before.

public function setDoctype { $this->getBootstrap()->getResource('view')->doctype('XHTML1\_STRICT'); //don't work because getBootstrap returns null. }
