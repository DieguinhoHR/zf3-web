I was wondering, is it possible to generate an image from somewhere else, and use that image with Zend PDF Image, so I don't have to save it to disk first?

Linking to ZF-11. Once the image classes are updated to use the Zend\_Pdf\_FileParser class, this change will be trivial.

Needs memory management issues to be done first. Needs to be reviewed after that.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.

Unassigning Zend\_Pdf issues currently assigned to me pending decision on ZF 2.0 release timeframe and potential contribution of comprehensive changeset.

Any news on that ? We are at two step for the 2.0 Version and this would be a great enhancement ...
