It seems this problem is resolved with some other commits.

Alex, has this really been resolved? I still got delays last time I ran these tests before 1.7.1.

I am planning on fixing this as soon as I get a chance. I want to port a feature from the FirePHPCore [1] library that allows excluding of specific object members from being logged. I think that will solve the problem without needing to resort to a helper script.

I hope to have time to do that in the next few weeks.
