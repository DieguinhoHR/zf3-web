### Description

The following is suggested in docs:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $hostnameRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Hostname(
        ':username.users.example.com',
        array(
            'controller' => 'profile',
            'action'     => 'userinfo'
        )
    );
    
    $plainPathRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static('');
    
    $router->addRoute('user', $hostnameRoute->chain($plainPathRoute);


The purpose of _$plainPathRoute_: to create a default route for users visiting the hostname _.users.example.com. Unfortunatelly this will never work, because static route of [empty string] \*will never match()_. Unfortunatelly, leaving only the Route\_Hostname is not an option - because as stated in the manual, lone Route\_Hostname will catch each and every request (?).

The bug is here: (line 78 in Zend/Controller/Router/Route/Static.php)

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function match($path, $partial = false)
        {
            if ($partial) {
                if (substr($path, 0, strlen($this->_route)) === $this->_route) {
                    $this->setMatchedPath($this->_route);
                    return $this->_defaults;
                }
            } else {
                if (trim($path, '/') == $this->_route) {
                    return $this->_defaults;
                }
            }


Why? _substr()_ of empty string always returns _false_ - thus this route will never match and the whole chain is ommited.

Fix:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        public function match($path, $partial = false)
        {
            if ($partial) {
                if (($this->_route === '' && $path === '') || substr($path, 0, strlen($this->_route)) === $this->_route) {
                    $this->setMatchedPath($this->_route);
                    return $this->_defaults;
                }
            } else {
                if (($this->_route === '' && $path === '') || trim($path, '/') == $this->_route) {
                    return $this->_defaults;
                }
            }

Modified fix to work with non-partial matches.

This will not work: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1203441/â€¦](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1203441/route-chaining-with-the-zend-framework)

_UPDATE_

It is also broken for simple chains, like the one in link above:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    adminadminindexindexloginadminloginindex

Expected: To work for urls _/admin_ and _/admin/login_.

Actual: It will only match for _/admin/login_.

Workaround: It's caused by the following snippet in _Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain_:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Matches a user submitted path with a previously defined route.
         * Assigns and returns an array of defaults on a successful match.
         *
         * @param  Zend_Controller_Request_Http $request Request to get the path info from
         * @return array|false An array of assigned values or a false on a mismatch
         */
        public function match($request, $partial = null)
        {
            $path    = trim($request->getPathInfo(), '/');
            $subPath = $path;
            $values  = array();
            
           foreach ($this->_routes as $key => $route) {
                if ($key > 0 && $matchedPath !== null) {
                    $separator = substr($subPath, 0, strlen($this->_separators[$key]));
                    if ($separator !== $this->_separators[$key]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    
                    $subPath = substr($subPath, strlen($separator));
                }


Below is a quick fix which takes into account the behaviour of _substr()_ on empty strings, as in this case when chain has already consumed _admin_ and an empty _''_ $subpath is left for matching.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Matches a user submitted path with a previously defined route.
         * Assigns and returns an array of defaults on a successful match.
         *
         * @param  Zend_Controller_Request_Http $request Request to get the path info from
         * @return array|false An array of assigned values or a false on a mismatch
         */
        public function match($request, $partial = null)
        {
            $path    = trim($request->getPathInfo(), '/');
            $subPath = $path;
            $values  = array();
            
           foreach ($this->_routes as $key => $route) {
                if ($key > 0 && $matchedPath !== null) {
                    $separator = substr($subPath, 0, strlen($this->_separators[$key]));
                    if (($subPath !== '') && $separator !== $this->_separators[$key]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    
                    $subPath = (string)substr($subPath, strlen($separator));
                }


What happens is that we check for empty string '' and then force (string) as a result of substr(), because other routes would fail to match agains _false_.

This allows "default" routes to work with simple non-host-based chains!

Cheers!

In 1.10 alpha this patch does not give the required result.

Thank you for info.

I am willing to analyze it and contribute a new patch as long as there is any chance of (finally) commiting and fixing it permanently!

Artur it would be great if you could look into this problem, because it is a real blocker (for me).

I need hostname based routing for my modules and the only "half"-workaround Ive managed to produce is following...

$hostnameRoute = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Hostname('admin.test.local',array('module' => 'admin'));

// Instead of empty static route...  
 // $oRoute = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Static('');

$oRoute = new Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route('/:controller/:action/\*', array('module' => 'admin', 'controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index'));

$router->addRoute('admin', $hostnameRoute->chain($oRoute));

With this Ive managed the routing part... but in the routing process the path information is build without "/" at the beginning. $this->\_request->getPathInfo() returns "controller/action" instead of "/controller/action" This breaks the Zend\_Navigation component !!

Maybe there is another workaround I am not aware of?

Hey Edvin!

Which version are you using? Have you patched your ZF with the snippets I provided?

I use these routes (suggested by docs, sic!) every day and they work fine.

 

 

Posted by John Kleijn (448191) on 2010-02-18T05:10:32.000+0000

Same issue here. I really don't want to patch ZF. I can probably override match() and the method in the standard router to use the child class instead of Zend\_Controller\_Router\_Route\_Chain on "chain" in the config, but obviously that's hardly ideal.

 

 

Posted by John Kleijn (448191) on 2010-02-18T05:58:49.000+0000

I fixed this by overriding some methods in the involved route classes (thanks Artur), but one issue remains: it never produces a 404. It always goes to the index action of the default module. This is probably a separate related issue, but just wanted to check if people experiencing the issue in this ticket are also having this issue..

 

 

Posted by Steven Young (monkeyhybrid) on 2010-05-25T12:05:44.000+0000

I've just come up against the same issue.

Is there a reason Artur's patches can not be commited in the trunk? I'm surprised more people aren't complaining about this problem.

I actually get the exact opposite of what the reporter and several commenters have discovered (when testing against current trunk, which is 1.11.0beta1): I can match the /admin route, but not the /admin/login route. I'm attempting to fix this issue now.

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2010-10-20T09:44:21.000+0000

Additionally, the behavior does not change with the "patch" applied.

 

 

Posted by Kim Blomqvist (kblomqvist) on 2010-10-20T10:07:08.000+0000

Matthew: check if this is related to ZF-8812.

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2010-10-20T11:07:55.000+0000

Kim -- nope. (I've applied your patches locally; doesn't change anything in regards to the environment and expectations presented here.)

 

 

Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney (matthew) on 2010-10-20T11:43:47.000+0000

Fixed in trunk and release branch. Patch had to change due to changes that have already been introduced; basic gist was that a check for (empty($path) && empty($this->\_route)) had to ORd to the existing partial conditional in the Static route.
