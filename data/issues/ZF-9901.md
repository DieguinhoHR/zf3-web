### Description

In Zend/Auth/Adapter/DbTable.php line 32. I think what no has need of include the file 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php'.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php';

Look at the constructor:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function __construct(Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract $zendDb = null, ...

@mikaelkael See comment of @matthew in ZF-8447. I think what if fits this case.

In this case, we could replace by at least:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    require_once 'Zend/Db.php';
    // and
    require_once 'Zend/Db/Expr.php';


used in the file and loaded when loading 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php'

Is this necessary since with ZF2 all require\_once will be stripped?

However, if $zendDb isn't an instance of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, we will throw an exception. If it is an instance of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract, then 'Zend/Db/Adapter/Abstract.php' is already loaded.

@Ralph: your idea on this issue (in general, not only this particular case)?
