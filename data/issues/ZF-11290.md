### Description

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    /**
     * ...
     *
     * // alternatively, with named binding
     * $select->where('id = :id');
     * 
     *
     * Note that it is more correct to use named bindings in your
     * queries for values other than strings. When you use named
     * bindings, don't forget to pass the values when actually
     * making a query:
     *
     * 
     * $db->fetchAll($select, array('id' => 5));
     * 
     * ...
     */


The docblock of Zend\_Db\_Select::where() is not valid anymore. Instead of this you have to use bind() method ...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $select->where('id = :id')
           ->bind(array(':id' => $id));
    $select->fetchAll($select);
