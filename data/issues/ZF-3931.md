### Description

Hi, i got a problem again I'm trying to search for a phrase using Zend\_Search\_Lucene Its like, i put a phrase and then search for it in severals documments But when i trying to find a long phrase (like more them 8 words) i got memory problem:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 71 bytes) in /var/www/html/bdnupill/zend/Zend/Search/Lucene/Index/SegmentInfo.php on line 782

Here's the code of the search for phrase:

$words = explode(" ",$textBusca);

$query1 = new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Search\_Query\_Phrase();

for($w=0;$w<count($words);$w++){ $query1->addTerm(new Zend\_Search\_Lucene\_Index\_Term($words[$w])); }

$hits1 = $index->find($query1);

any ideas?

another thing: Zend dont support pontuation? Like dot's and commas? Cause i have to take them off before make a phrase search
