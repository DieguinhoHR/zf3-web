### Description

At the moment FlashMessenger only supports a numeric array of messages. It would be usefull to be able to specify a handle for a message:

$this->\_flashMessenger->addMessage('There was an error validating your form', 'error');

The second parameter is the handle, so when I want to assign the error message to my view, I can do this:

$this->view->error = $this->\_flashMessenger->getMessage('error');
