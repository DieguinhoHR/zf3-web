If would be nice to have ability to remove separate headers by their respective names, i.e. $this->getResponse()->clearHeader('Pragma')

This patch adds two new methods to Zend\_Controller\_Response\_Abstract with associated passing tests:

1. clearHeader + testClearHeader
2. clearRawHeader + testClearRawHeader

Please review -- if anything looks problematic please let me know.
