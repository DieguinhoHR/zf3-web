### Description

I propose to implement the \_\_call() magic method in Zend\_Translate to reduce php code lines, class maintenance, to improve performance and to isolate the facace from the abstract component. This can be translated in a smaller file and framework size, in less headache when the abstract class Zend\_Translate\_Adapter is modified, in less time spelt to parse php code and in the avoiding any repetition of code (enemy of any programmer).

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public fucntion __call($method, array $arguments)
    {
        return call_user_func_array(array($this->_adapter, $method), $arguments) ;
    }


Everything under the line 115 can be removed. 133 lines of php code less.

I implemented the change with SVN 6547...

But I had to change your proposed code a little bit, because PHP didn't want to work with "fucntion". ;-)
