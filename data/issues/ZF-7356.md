### Description

It version 1.9.0a1 it seems that there is a problem with Zend/Locale/Data/supplementalData.xml

Line 3763 is

but should be

I found the problem by running the following.

Zend\_Locale::clearCache(); $date = new Zend\_Date(); foreach (Zend\_Locale::getTranslationList('TimezoneToWindows') as $name => $timezone) { $date->setTimezone($timezone); }

Throws an exception: Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Date\_Exception' with message 'timezone (Africa/Reykjavik) is not a known timezone'

Thrown in ZendFramework-1.9.0a1/library/Zend/Date/DateObject.php on line 1004

This doesn't appear to be a problem in 1.8.4PL1

Reykjavik in Africa, that will heat up some things :D

All the files in that Data/ directory are CLDR files. We are not allowed to edit them, so you should probably file an issue at the CLDR issue tracker.

I'm leaving this issue open to let Thomas Weidner decide what should be further done with it ;)

This problem is not a ZF issue it's a CLDR issue (the I18n database ZF is using).

Please commit a issue to CLDR (<www.unicode.org/cldr>) as we're not allowed to deliver changed database content.

I just checked version 1.7.1 of the CLDR and it appears to be fixed.
