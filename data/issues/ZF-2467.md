### Description

Sending more requests after each other produces wrong requests on the remote server.

$client = new Zend\_Rest\_Client('<http://127.0.0.1/rest.php>'); $res = $client->add(0,0,0,0,0,0)->get(); var\_dump($res);

$client = new Zend\_Rest\_Client('<http://127.0.0.1/rest.php>'); $res = $client->find(16)->get(); var\_dump($res);

GET /rest.php?method=add&arg0=0&arg1=0&arg2=0&arg3=0&arg4=0&arg5=0&rest=1 HTTP/1.1" 200 175 "-" "Zend\_Http\_Client" GET /rest.php?find=16&arg1=16&rest=1 HTTP/1.1" 404 202 "-" "Zend\_Http\_Client"

As you can see, the 2nd request is incorrect, and contains no "method" argument, resulting in an error from the server.

Unsetting priority and assigning to Davey for review. Davey, please assign priority for 1.5 release.

Looks like issues ZF-2467, ZF-2215, ZF-2044 are all related to this problem.
