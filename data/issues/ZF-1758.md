ZF-1758: Bug in documentation or code
-------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2007-07-23T13:39:30.000+0000 Last Updated: 2007-07-24T05:58:59.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s):

### Description

In the documentation on <http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.http.html> . Table 15.1 states that httpversion is a float. If one tries to give 1.0 as a float the 0 is removes in the request and causes a bad request. 1.0 needs to be given as a string in order to work.

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    //Creates bad request but no error message from the package:
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="https://xxx.xxx">https://xxx.xxx</a>');
    $client->setConfig(array(
      'httpversion' => 1.0
       ));
    
    //Works fine:
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client(' <a href="https://xxx.xxx">https://xxx.xxx</a> ');
     
    $client->setConfig(array(
     'httpversion' => '1.0'
     ));


I don't know if this is a bug in the code or in the documentation. Anyway it made me spend two hours figuring out why my SMS gateway gave me a bad request error.

Just to mention, even if I am not the author:

Your first code example will throw an PHP compiler error due to not closing the comma.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="https://xxx.xxx">https://xxx.xxx</a>);
    
    // should be written :
    $client = new Zend_Http_Client('<a href="https://xxx.xxx">https://xxx.xxx</a>');  // note the ending  '

Corrected missing ' in code example

There's going to be too much overhead if the code was to be modified, so I've changed the docs to use string and not float.

Fixed in revision 5818.
