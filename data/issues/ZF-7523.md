### Description

When you set de strategy for complex type detection and handling the Class WSLD use the param $strategy and recive this values True, False or String Value

For True value the function setComplexTypeStrategy does

 
            require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Strategy/DefaultComplexType.php";  #Include the Strategy File
            $strategy = new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Strategy_DefaultComplexType(); #Set the object with the class defined on the Strategy  Include file


For the False value does:

 
            require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Strategy/AnyType.php"; #Include the Strategy File
            $strategy = new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Strategy_AnyType(); #Set the object with the class defined on the Strategy  Include file


But in the String Value case, exists those values :

Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeSequence or Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeComplex

The function try to check if the $strategy class exists, and if this class its not defined, thow an Expection.. thats Ok...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(class_exists($strategy)) {
        $strategy = new $strategy();
    } else {
        require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Exception.php";
        throw new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Exception(
            sprintf("Strategy with name '%s does not exist.", $strategy
        ));
    }


but, how its gonna exists the class if you doesn't include the class file like the other boolean cases.

I did a Fix for this including the strategy file class with

//----------- Here -------------- require\_once str\_replace("\_", "/", $strategy) . ".php"; //----------- End Here --------------

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    if(class_exists($strategy)) {
        $strategy = new $strategy();
    } else {
        require_once "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Exception.php";
        throw new Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Exception(
            sprintf("Strategy with name '%s does not exist.", $strategy
        ));
    }


and now with Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeSequence or Zend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_ArrayOfTypeComplex cases, the WSLD class load the files "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Strategy/ArrayOfTypeSequence.php" and "Zend/Soap/Wsdl/Strategy/ArrayOfTypeComplex.php"
