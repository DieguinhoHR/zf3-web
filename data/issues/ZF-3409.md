### Description

An AddAttrib method its needed in cases when it is necesary to append more than one value to an attribute, like when setting more than one value to a class attribute, since setMethod reset the value, allowing only one value for the attribute, something like addAttribute could work.

actually it is possible to append value with overloading like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    
    but there also should be a method for this like:


that would append that class to any existing one, or create the attribute if necesary, so the output could be ```

I think this would be unexpected behavior for most attributes.
