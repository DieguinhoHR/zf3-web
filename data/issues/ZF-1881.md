### Description

(Unable to select Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract in Component list)

Modify \_whereExpr in Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract so that $where parameter for Zend\_Db\_Table\_Abstract update and delete is the same as $where parameter for fetchRow and fetchAll

The Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Abstract::\_whereExpr function needs to be changed to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Convert an array, string, or Zend_Db_Expr object
         * into a string to put in a WHERE clause.
         *
         * @param mixed $where
         * @return string
         */
        protected function _whereExpr($where)
        {
            if (empty($where)) {
                return $where;
            }
            if (!is_array($where)) {
                $where = array($where);
            }
            foreach ($where as $cond => &$term) {
                // is $cond an int? (i.e. Not a condition)
                if (is_int($cond)) {
                    // $term is the full condition
                    if ($term instanceof Zend_Db_Expr) {
                        $term = $term->__toString();
                    }
                } else {
                    // $cond is the condition with placeholder,
                    // and $term is quoted into the condition
                    $term = $this->quoteInto($cond, $term);
                }
                $term = '(' . $term . ')';
            }
    
            $where = implode(' AND ', $where);
            return $where;
        }

Patch to modify Zend\_Db\_Adaptor\_Abstract such that where clauses are consistent between insert, update, delete and select

Would love to see this issue reimplemented. All of a sudden my deletes where deleting whole tables!

I've changed the code to:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
        /**
         * Convert an array, string, or Zend_Db_Expr object
         * into a string to put in a WHERE clause.
         *
         * @param mixed $where
         * @return string
         */
        protected function _whereExpr($where)
        {
            if (empty($where)) {
                return $where;
            }
            if (!is_array($where)) {
                $where = array($where);
            }
            foreach ($where as  $key => &$term) {
                if ($term instanceof Zend_Db_Expr) {
                    $term = $term->__toString();
                }elseif (is_string($key)) {
                    $term = $this->quoteInto($key, $term);
                }
                $term = '(' . $term . ')';
            }
            $where = implode(' AND ', $where);
            return $where;
        }

Please categorize/fix as needed.

Resetting 'fix version priority' and 'fix version' to be re-evaluated for next release.
