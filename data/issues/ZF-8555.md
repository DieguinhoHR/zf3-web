### Description

The done flag is never being changed to 1. I verified the code and it seems it's only done for the branch using the fileprogress extension.

I could fix it locally. (see patch)

The same fix can be done as a workaround by making the same verification after the call. Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http::getProgress( $id ); $upload['done'] = $upload['total'] == $upload['current'];

However, I am wondering is this change to done should not be made as part of receive() instead.

Patch to apply the same done check to both extensions.

I can not verify this behaviour.

For APC the key "done" is part of the return value from apc\_fetch. It is part of APC's upload cache. See [http://php.net/manual/en/â€¦](http://www.php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php#ini.apc.rfc1867) for details.

When you are not getting this return value within your environment then there is something completly wrong.

For the fileupload extension we simulate this key, therefor it is set explicitly for this extension.

I don't know what the expected behavior is, but I can confirm that using APC 3.1.3pl1, 'done' is not being set to 1.

The initial sample of the feature by Rasmus sets the flag manually. <http://progphp.com/progress.phps>

Reading the example you gave from Rasmus the "done" key is NOT set manually.

Wether while the upload is in progress, nor when it has been finished the key is set manually.

When in your beta-release of APC, the done key is not set you can not rely on it. Note that within default PHP installations (where APC is delivered) there is no problem.

I made additional tests. The issue is not present when using APC 3.0.19.
