### Description

The rendering of the tags in the documentation are not putting the tags in the footnote, but inline with the documentation for the link to the footnote.

As an example, here is a snippet from the XML file Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscovery.xml.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
                    <acronym>PHP</acronym> class <-> based on complex type strategy (See:
                            )
    
                            Zend_Soap_AutoDiscover will be created with
                                    the
                                    Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Strategy_DefaultComplexType
                                    class as detection algorithm for complex types. The first parameter
                                    of the AutoDiscover constructor takes any complex type strategy
                                    implementing
                                    Zend_Soap_Wsdl_Strategy_Interface or a string
                                    with the name of the class. For backwards compatibility with
                                    $extractComplexType boolean variables are parsed
                                    exactly like in Zend_Soap_Wsdl. See the
                                    Zend_Soap_Wsdl
                                        manual on adding complex types for more information.
                                .


This is rendered in 1 parts.

The first is in the main body of the document ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.soap.autodiscovery.html#zend.soap.autodiscovery.datatypes)) ...

{quote} PHP class <-> based on complex type strategy (See: Adding complex type information) [1] Zend\_Soap\_AutoDiscoverZend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_DefaultComplexTypeZend\_Soap\_Wsdl\_Strategy\_Interface$extractComplexTypeZend\_Soap\_WsdlZend\_Soap\_Wsdl manual on adding complex . {quote}

The second is the actual footnote ([http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.soap.autodiscovery.html#fnid1)) ...

{quote} [1] will be created with the class as detection algorithm for complex types. The first parameter of the AutoDiscover constructor takes any complex type strategy implementing or a string with the name of the class. For backwards compatibility with boolean variables are parsed exactly like in . See the types for more information. {quote}

As you can see, all the 's are missing from the footnote and are in the main body.

Regards,

Richard Quadling.

P.S. If someone can point me to the rendering code, I'll take a look. If it is all XSLT, then don't bother. I don't know anywhere near enough of that.
