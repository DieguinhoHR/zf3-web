ZF-5104: Zend\_Loader uses DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR while all framework's file use simple slash for includes

### Description

The problem is that it runs into "Cannot redeclare class XXX" on windows.

Run this code: require\_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend\_Loader::registerAutoload(); new Zend\_Session\_Namespace();

The same file will be included again because it's loaded once using autoloader ('\\') and once using script's require ('/').

I would suggest to require files within scripts using DIRECTORY\_SEPARATOR. Or change behaviour of Zend\_Loader::loadClass to use simple slash as we're already easy on this in script files and doesn't care about OS differencies.

Well, I'm sorry but it seems more like Zend Studio issue automaticaly including Zend and priority of inludes. I will investigate more. But I can say it's not Zend Framework code related.
