ZF-4036: Default arguments to Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select::join creates invalid queries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

The default arguments for Zend\_Db\_Select::join specify a wildcard for the "columns" argument. The integrity check of Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select, however, rejects queries which don't have an empty array for the columns value of joined tables. This means that something like:

$select = $myTable->select()->join('other\_table', 'other\_table.fk = my\_table.id');

produces a select query that fails the integrity check. This is counter-intuitive; it would be helpful if Zend\_Db\_Table\_Select added its own version of the join methods, which specified an empty array as the default argument for $columns.
