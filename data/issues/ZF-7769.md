### Description

Not sure if this belongs as an issue, or a proposal...

When viewing pages in the reference manual, it would be nice to have each sub-section have it's own table of contents,

I'm constantly finding myself going back to the first page to locate things that half the time are on the page I am already looking at.

Likewise, it would be useful to have the section titles available on each page within the chapter, so you can easily jump to the relevant page.

i.e. You're on Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row, and want to read up on Zend\_Db\_Select, the quickest route is to go back to the Zend\_Db page, then click on Zend\_Db\_Select in the table of contents. You could click Prev twice, which is just as "quick" but requires memorizing the table of contents to know which way to go, so is kind of a moot point.

So my suggestion is:

Taking Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset as an example, at the top of the page the table of contents for the section:

Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset 15.7.1. Introduction 15.7.2. Fetching a Rowset 15.7.3. Retrieving Rows from a Rowset 15.7.4. Retrieving a Rowset as an Array 15.7.5. Serializing and Unserializing a Rowset 15.7.6. Extending the Rowset class

Then in the right hand column above the components section:

Chapter Overview 15.1. Zend\_Db\_Adapter 15.2. Zend\_Db\_Statement 15.3. Zend\_Db\_Profiler 15.4. Zend\_Db\_Select 15.5. Zend\_Db\_Table 15.6. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Row 15.7. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Rowset 15.8. Zend\_Db\_Table Relationships 15.9. Zend\_Db\_Table\_Definition

The full chapter table of contents could then be on a dedicated page. This makes a lot of sense in large chapters like Zend\_Db, where you have to scroll down 4-5 pages before you get to the Zend\_Db\_Adapter section.

Set component and auto reassign

The issue affects all components, not just Zend\_Db.
