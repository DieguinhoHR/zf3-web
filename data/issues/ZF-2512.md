### Description

It is possible to crash Zend\_Translate sometime:

Sample: i am using general.en and also module.en files, and i need for english to translate from both.

By using this:

 
        $translate = new Zend_Translate('csv', './data/module.en'); //missing third param
        $translate->addTranslation('./data/general.en', 'en');


Seems even translation from first file is stopped working.

Your initiation is wrong... if you give no locale then the locale from your browser is taken. And if this can not be found the locale from your server is used.

This means that when a "french" user accesses your site it will not work... Your code did not work even before you added the other file.

Do new Zend\_Translate('csv', './data/module.en', 'en');

or use the automatic directory search new Zend\_Translate('csv', './data', array('scan' => Zend\_Translate::LOCALE\_FILENAME));

Both is described in the manual.

CVS itself does not provide informations on which language has been used... and the name, extension is only used as locale if defined !!
