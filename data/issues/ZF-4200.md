### Description

Previously in 1.5 it is set in the registry a new Locale object in the boot strap, which follows on from the manual. This should be made aware in classes such as Zend\_currency. However after upgrading to 1..6 the error message is thrown,

I have tried setting differnet locales, en\_GB, en\_US, but both don't work. Messed around with php.ini settings, but still doesn't work, and the problem occurs when actually constructing a new zend\_currency object. Soon as it does this the program fails.

Also have tried setting php locale to en\_GB, but still doesn't work.

However, I can revert back to 1.5 libraries straight away and works.

Can this problem be solved.

Let me paraphrase this clearly:

Please look in the manual, this is what I attempt to do; at section 27.1.8, example : 27.9 url: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.locale.html#zend.locale.frameworkwidelocale)

I explicitly do that but instead of constructing a zend\_date i construct a zend\_currency instead.

P.S sorry, I should have put example, or least with section. Innocent mistake, thankyou for your patience.

Regarding to your failure message you gave the locale 'en' to Zend\_Currency and not en\_US or en\_GB. Within the exception message always the given locale will be returned.

As "en" does not contain region informations it will throw an exception. This was already in past the case.

Check your locale definition.

I don't think so... :-)

Section 27.9 does not exists. After 27.5 comes 28. Please give a reproducable example when you can not refer to the online manual.

This does only work when you are using the trunk or ZF 1.7. The dev-team has decided to delay this feature until 1.7.

So you eighter update to SVN trunk, wait until 1.7 or set the locale manually for each object.

Changing issues in preparation for the 1.7.0 release.
