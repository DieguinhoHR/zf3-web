### Description

When two or more modules define the following definition the method (factory) becomes incorrectly uncallable...

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    return array(
        'di' => array(
            'definition' => array(
                'class' => array(
                    'Zend\Cache\Storage\Adapter\Filesystem' => array(
                        'instantiator' => array(
                            'Zend\Cache\StorageFactory',
                            'factory',
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    );


 
    <pre class="literal"> 
    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'RuntimeException' with message 'Invalid instantiator: Zend\Cache\StorageFactory::factory() is not callable.' in /vendor/ZendFramework/library/Zend/Di/Di.php:198


On investigation is seems the 'instantiator' array is merged incorrectly, as it contents will be the following, which is indeed not a valid PHP callback.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Array
    (
        [0] => Zend\Cache\StorageFactory
        [1] => factory
        [2] => Zend\Cache\StorageFactory
        [3] => factory
    )


I am unsure how to resolve such a configuration. Should DI assume the first two keys as correct?
