### Description

On the page [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/…](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.load.html#zend.loader.load.file), it says that the loadFile() method "returns boolean FALSE on failure, for example if the specified file does not exist." This appears to not be the case. As far as I can tell, the loadFile() method always returns true.

Patch added.

The above patch fixes the documentation, but, if possible, I think it would be better to have the loadFile() method return TRUE or FALSE, as the original documentation says.

Warnings could be suppressed by using @include and @include\_once, but I'm not sure how we would check to see if the file had been successfully loaded. We could do something like this:

 
    <pre class="literal">if((@include $file_name) === false) {
       return false;
    }
    
    return true;


But if the included file has code in it to return false, then this will fail. I'm not sure if there's a proper way to check for failure to include files, though, as I don't think surrounding it in a try/catch block would work, either.

Also, how do I attack a patch? I don't see anywhere to do that :\\

Updated documentation to match reality as we won't be slowing down loadFile().
