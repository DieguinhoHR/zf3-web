ZF-6037: setSalt on Zend\_Form\_Element\_Hash doesn't work as expected
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

Setting the salt after object construction will have no effect on the session namespace. The salt must be passed to the construct method as an option. If setting the salt manually afterwards the session name won't be updated.

A workaround which should work is to do this after setting the salt manually:

$hash->setSession(new Zend\_Session\_Namespace($hash->getSessionName())); $hash->initCsrfToken();

I don't know if this is a desired behaviour. If not, perhaps adding the two calls above to the setSalt method would work. Another method (which might work) would be to have the session created just before being output, eg. in the \_\_toString method.

\_\_toString() {

// setup sessions etc; return parent::\_\_toString();

}

One could also make the setSalt method protected, thus forcing the to be passed to the construct.
