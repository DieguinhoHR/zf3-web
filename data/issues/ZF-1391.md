ZF-1391: Logical error in SQL of Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci::describeTable()

### Description

In Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Oci::describeTable(), the incoming $schemaName translates to TABLESPACE\_NAME in the query. However, it is possible to have 2 distinct physical tables of the same (exact) name in the same physical tablespace. So, TABLESPACE\_NAME does not guarantee a unique table description.

Changing the identifier from TABLESPACE\_NAME to OWNER and making sure that the ALL\_TABLES.OWNER and ALL\_TAB\_COLUMNS.OWNER match gives the correct result for a unique physical table.

I'll attach a patch but would like to hear if this conflicts with anyone else's understanding of Oracle tables.

Thanks for the patch, Troy. I am beginning to understand the nuances of Oracle terminology with respect to tablespace, schema, and user. They could certainly make those concepts a little more clear in their documentation.

The patch you show definitely implements the intended behavior, and I understand why TABLESPACE\_NAME is not correct.
