### Description

In a project with this structure:

application

 
    library
        ExtX <<<< LIBRARY THAT EXTENDS ZEND 1
        nameX <<<< PROBLEM: LIBRARY THAT EXTENDS ZEND WITH SAME MODULE NAME
    
    modules
        nameX  <<<< PROBLEM: MODULE NAME WITH SAME NAME AS LIBRARY
            controllers
            models
            forms
            views
                ....
        nameY


public index.php ... library Zend

It will fail with this message:

Warning: Zend\_Loader::include(nameX\\Bootstrap.php) [function.Zend-Loader-include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in \\Zend\\Loader.php on line 83

it's trying to load the Bootstrap from the library????

I can make a fail sample based on quickstart project sample if someone require it.

- Library directory is included in includePaths : application/library
- Library is included in autoloadernamespaces: 'ExtX\_', 'nameX\_',

This error is a bloker Zend 1.8 may will work in a small application but not in complex ones.

No one still give a answer about this bug:

<http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-6646>

That maybe it's related, that bug fail loading models..

First off, the warning is not a failure -- it's saying that the first place it looked for the file, it did not exist. It then moves on to look in the next autoloader.

Second, the Bootstrap is a special case, and there is another issue related to this (though I need to look up the ID still). In that particular case, we should not be hitting the autoloader when looking for the class. This will correct that particular message.

Finally, it's okay to have multiple autoloaders attempting to hit the same namespace; each may be using different rules and matching different kinds of classes. In the case where a module has the same namespace as some library code, the assumption should be that the module autoloader will trigger first, and attempt to find code related to the application, while the namespace autoloader will trigger second, to find library code (which will presumably have different components than the application).

Regarding ZF--6646, no, I have not yet had time to reproduce it. As noted in the comments, my initial reproduction did not produce the issues reported. I will try again once I get a chance, but right now, it's lower priority due to that fact.

About -> "First off, the warning is not a failure" means this will be not corrected??

In a big project (important ones) this is a blocker, If a application library can not be called, the application itself is useless... There are 2 workarounds: rename the library or rename the module, none of them is a practical solution..

Loader has a lot of problem since 1.8.. anyone can comment this???

The warning you get is a php warning, I suppose by PHP triggered itself. If you want to get rid of them you can simply set your error\_reporting to something like E\_NONE, which you should be doing anyways in a production environment.

"If a application library can not be called, the application itself is useless..." Of course Zend\_Loader was designed with certain (common) usecases in mind. I would like to stress the fact that you are in no way obligated to use Zend\_Loader, and are free to use a different one, maybe even one selfcoded and that fully suites the needs of your application.

"Loader has a lot of problem since 1.8.. anyone can comment this???" Given the amount of people that use the new autoloader, I think it's safe to say that it doesn't really have a lot of problems. Besides that, the few issues that did arise with the new autoloader were solved between 1.8.0 and 1.8.2. This is of course also the responsibility of the community. The new autoloader has been in incubator and trunk for quite some time before it was actually released. These are the stages in which the community can be expected to test new functionality, to foresee possible problems, without having the need to complain afterwards.

p.s. Punctuation characters are no pack animals.

This issue is not an issue and no feedback has been given after all this time, so closing this is the right thing to do.
