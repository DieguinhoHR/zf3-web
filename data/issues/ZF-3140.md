### Description

Using \_\_toString method of Zend\_DB\_Select class, it calls the limit function at Zend\_Db\_Adapter\_Pdo\_Mssql with params:

sql = SELECT "noticies".\* FROM "noticies" ORDER BY "NOTICIES"."ID" ASC count = 1 offset = 0

Generates a sql statement like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT *
      FROM (SELECT TOP 1 *
                     FROM (SELECT TOP 1 "noticies".*
                                       FROM "noticies"
                                   ORDER BY "NOTICIES"."ID" ASC) AS inner_tbl
                  ORDER BY "NOTICIES"."ID" DESC) AS outer_tbl
    ORDER BY "NOTICIES"."ID" asc


Producing the error:

SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 10007 The column prefix 'NOTICIES' does not match with a table name or alias name used in the query. [10007] (severity 5) [(null)] File: Pdo.php, Line: 238

Please evaluate and categorize as necessary.

The problem occurs when the limited statement has a order by. The SQL generated is like:

SELECT \* \_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP nn \* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP xx \* FROM ORDER BY ) as INNERTBL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ORDER BY ) as OUTERTBL \_\_\_ORDER BY

the second order must refered to INNERTBL (no original tables) and the third one must be referenced to OUTERTBL not to the original...

Reassigning to Ralph since he's the new maintainer of Zend\_Db

What is the expected generated statement for MSSQL? Do you know offhand? What is expected in general?

The generated statement is like: SELECT \* \_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP nn \* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP xx \* FROM ORDER BY ) as INNERTBL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ORDER BY ) as OUTERTBL \_\_\_ORDER BY

and it must be something like :

SELECT \* \_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP nn \* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_FROM (SELECT TOP xx \* FROM ORDER BY ) as INNERTBL \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ORDER BY ) as OUTERTBL \_\_\_ORDER BY

Suposing the original\_order is table1.col1, table1.col1 ... must be INNERTBL.col1, INNERTBL.col2 and OUTERTBL.col1, OUTERTBL.col2

When I reached the error I try the proposed syntax query directly to the database and it seems to work.
