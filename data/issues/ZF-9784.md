### Description

Trying to set curl adapter (when program is distributed to others, running in an unknown environnemnt), if curl extension is not loaded on that machine, Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl correctly throw a Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception. However, some notices are thrown before that because Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Curl has a property (protected $\_invalidOverwritableCurlOptions ) which is initialized with an array of CURL options constants ( array( CURLOPT\_HTTPGET,CURLOPT\_POST,CURLOPT\_PUT,...).

As the extension is not loaded, these constants do not exists and thus a number ofnotices are thrown.

I solved by doiing the initilialization in the constructor, after the chcek for curl to be loaded : public function \_\_construct() { if (!extension\_loaded('curl')) { require\_once JPATH\_COMPONENT . DS . 'lib' . DS . 'Zend/Http/Client/Adapter/Exception.php'; throw new Zend\_Http\_Client\_Adapter\_Exception('cURL extension has to be loaded to use this Zend\_Http\_Client adapter.'); }

 
        $this->_invalidOverwritableCurlOptions = array(
        CURLOPT_HTTPGET,
        CURLOPT_POST,
        CURLOPT_PUT

moved the curl constant initialization into \_\_construct()
