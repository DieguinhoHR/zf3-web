ZF-7110: Zend\_Gdata ignores hostname mismatch
----------------------------------------------

### Description

When connecting to Google's auth servers, Zend\_Gdata\_ClientLogin does not seem to detect hostname mismatches when negotiating the SSL connection. Presumably, this applies to AuthSub as well.

This needs to be fixed to prevent a Mi tM attack against user's credentials.

No progress yet, other things have been taking up my time.

I might be able to spend some time on this sometime in the next week.
