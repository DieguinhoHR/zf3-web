### Description

Indicating that a method or property is static is ignored by CodeGenerator.

When setting properties on my class like so:

 
    <pre class="literal">
            $gen->setName($className)
                ->setDocblock($docblock)
                ->setProperties(array(
                    array(
                        'name'          => 'columns',
                        'visibility'    => 'public',
                        'static'        => true,
                        'defaltValue'   => ''
                    )
                ))


The generated output does not indicate that the property is static. In fact, as shown below, the isStatic() method is never even checked except to setStatic during reflection. See below:

 
    <pre class="literal">
    daves-macbookpro ~/dev/php/ZendFramework-1.8.0b1-minimal/library/Zend/CodeGenerator: ack Static
    Php/Member/Abstract.php
    52:    protected $_isStatic   = false;
    120:     * setStatic()
    122:     * @param bool $isStatic
    125:    public function setStatic($isStatic)
    127:        $this->_isStatic = ($isStatic) ? true : false;
    132:     * isStatic()
    136:    public function isStatic()
    138:        return $this->_isStatic;
    
    Php/Method.php
    93:        $method->setStatic($reflectionMethod->isStatic());

This may be duplicated by description in ZF-6958. I think the description would be better to reflect on this issue.

static methods still ignored.

Are you on trunk? If you are using 1.8.4 you're right. On Jun 28th the latest released was packaged already, and therefore the solution to this issue could not be packaged with 1.8.4, but will probably be in 1.8.5.

I use SVN URL:

[http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend)

where static and final in Zend\_CodeGenerator\_Php\_Method is still ignored.
