### Description

Hi

The documentation for Zend\_Rest\_Server and \_Client is a good start, but I had to spend a fair bit of time Googling, experimenting, and digging through the source to get it to work. A few changes to the docs might make it easier for others...?

Zend\_Rest\_Server example 45.6 could be shown as part of a normal Zend\_Controller\_Action, giving the complete context that you need to get a server working.  
 function restAction() { $this->\_helper->viewRenderer->setNoRender(); $server = new Zend\_Rest\_Server(); $server->setClass('My\_Service\_Class'); $server->handle( $this->\_request->getParams() ); }

Note that My\_Service\_Class should do its own parameter validation in each public method.

Zend\_Rest\_Client example 45.1 is slightly misleading

Differences in Calling: If you are calling a web service that is part of a standard Zend Framework application, you can't use the ->get() method because it appends ?method=sayHello&who=Davey&when=Day to the URL (eg resulting in [http://framework.zend.com/webservice/rest/â€¦](http://framework.zend.com/webservice/rest/?method=sayHello&who=Davey&when=Day)), which doesn't work. You need to use ->post() instead so that the standard routers can correctly separate the parameters.

If your web service needs a session eg to maintain logged in status then call $client->getHTTPClient()->setCookieJar(); eg $client = new Zend\_Rest\_Client('<http://framework.zend.com/rest>'); $client->getHTTPClient()->setCookieJar(); $client->login( $user, $password )->post(); echo $client->sayHello('Davey', 'Day')->post();

Thanks: have been very impressed with how easy this component is to use, and how well it is integrated with the rest of the framework.

We plan to deprecate Zend\_Rest\_Server in favor of Zend\_Rest\_Route + Zend\_Rest\_Controller; since this is the case, it makes no sense to spend more time documenting it.

I recommend using the MVC in order to create your RESTful services.
