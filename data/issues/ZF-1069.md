### Description

Example provided in section 7.4.3.8. Static Routes is wrong:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $loginRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static('login', array('controller' => 'login', 'action' => 'form'));
    $router->addRoute('login', $static);


Should be instead something like:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    $staticRoute = new Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static('login', array('controller' => 'login', 'action' => 'form'));
    $router->addRoute('login', $staticRoute);
