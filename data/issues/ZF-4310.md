### Description

In continue of issue ZF-3348

Zend\_OpenId\_Provider returns "openid.mode=cancel" in check\_immediate mode (protocol version 1.1). But OpenID 1.1 specification says (par. 4.2.2.1.) that "openid.mode" must be _always_ equal "id\_res" in check\_immediate mode, regardless of positive or negative response. For all awailable for me OpenID 1.1 consumers "cancel" response immediately breaks auth process.

See [http://openid.net/specs/…](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html#mode_checkid_immediate) and [http://openidenabled.com/resources/openid-test/…](http://openidenabled.com/resources/openid-test/checkup) for tests.
