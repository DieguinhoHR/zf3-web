### Description

A database based caching backend should exist (and not just sqlite). Of course it would use adapters just like standard Zend\_Db\_Table objects. Operates the same as other backends like sqlite, but can be adapted to MySql/Postgresql, etc. Just pass it the table name and relevant column names.

This would be an _ideal_ caching backend for many applications that are on shared hosts w/o a faster cache such as Memcache. Much faster than files. Also useful as the 'slow' backend in Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels. Memcache/APC for the fast cache, DbTable for the 'slow' cache... That would be _very_ useful for high traffic apps.

Right now, there really isn't a viable 'slow' (non-memory based) backend for Zend\_Cache\_Backend\_TwoLevels for applications with load sufficient to require a two level cache.

The biggest use of this would be on shared hosts...for the sites that can't use memcache, apc, zend\_\*, sqlite, xcache...ANY backend besides file.

Garbage collection could be handled in the same way it is in sqlite and file backends.

This would be extremely useful, the same way session handling in databases is very useful, this comes in handy when spanning multiple machines/zones/instances.
