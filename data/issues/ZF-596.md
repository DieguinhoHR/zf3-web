### Description

This is the content of a test case bootstrap file (using revision 1861):

<

pre class="highlight">``

 
    <?php
    include 'Zend.php';
    function __autoload($class) {
      Zend::loadClass($class);
    }
    
    $request = new Zend_Controller_Request_Http('<a href="http://example.com/bar/foo">http://example.com/bar/foo</a>');
    
    $controller = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $controller->setControllerDirectory('.');
    $response = $controller->dispatch($request);
    
    print_r($response);


IndexController.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class IndexController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
      public function indexAction() {
        $this->getResponse()->setBody('index/index');
      }
      public function fooAction() {
        $this->getResponse()->setBody('index/foo');
      }
    }


BarController.php

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    class BarController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
      public function indexAction() {
        $this->getResponse()->setBody('bar/index');
      }
      public function fooAction() {
        $this->getResponse()->setBody('bar/foo');
      }
    }


As you can see, the request should be routed to bar/foo. This will result as expected into a response of

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    Zend_Controller_Response_Http Object (
      [_body:protected] => bar/foo
      ...


But if someone calls baz/foo instead of bar/foo the index/foo is called. This is because the Zend\_Controller\_Dispatcher can't find a BazController class, so it uses the getDefaultController()'s return value which is 'index'. But it still leaves the action as provided, not using the getDefaultAction()'s return value.

Apart from this error, in my opinion the dispatch process should distinguish between calling the default controller in case of a controller instantiation error and calling it in case of a not provided controller's name. Otherwise in default/default one has to check both the controller's name and action's name against the values in getRequest() to determine if it is called on purpose or accidentally (to know whether to return either a 200 or a 404 status to the client).

||controller \*)||action \*)|| should call||controller||action|| |empty|empty| |default|default| |controller|empty| |controller|default| |controller|wrong| |controller|\_\_call| |wrong|whatever| |error|error| ^\*)^ as provided by the router

'default' are the values returned by getDefaultController() and getDefaultAction() respectively. 'error' are new variables of the dispatcher, used in case of a non-callable controller. These could default to the getDefaultXXX()'s values. Alternatively a predefined action name of the default controller could be used (like the former 'noRoute').

Btw. the dispatcher's code ends in cleaning up some variables only used in former versions ($reflection, $method).

Assigning to Matthew, scheduling for possible fix in the 0.6.0 release.

On reflection (no pun intended), I don't think it makes sense to silently call the default controller if the controller was not found; I'm going to opt to throw an exception in this case. The router can determine if the controller is routable, and use a default if not.

Resolved in revision 1915. Now throws exception if the controller class does not exist.
