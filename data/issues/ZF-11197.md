### Description

When sending data via PHPUnit to Zend\_From containing Zend\_Form\_Element\_File (which is optional) isValid method returns false. However the same form submitted in browser validates successfully.

Here's some extra info. Given the following form:

 
    <pre class="highlight"> 
    <?php
    
    class Application_Form_Test extends Zend_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
            $this->addElement($element);
        }
    }


The following unit test should pass:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    <?php
    
    class MyTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function testFormValidates()
        {
            $form = new Application_Form_Test();
            $this->assertTrue($form->isValid(array()));
        }
    }


This however is not the case, due to a short-circuit in Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract line 620

Zend\_Form\_Element\_File lazy-loads the Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Http class to handle the actual file transfer. Obviously this works well with an actual form, but in the context of unit testing causes a bit of a problem.

This is how I would get around it: (caveat: this may not be the best, or "officially supported", way)

What you will need to do is create mock adapter which implements Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_Abstract and feeds in a "dummy" file. For example, Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_AbstractTest already has such a mock adapter, so if you'll have the ZF test suite available when running your own tests you can lean on that:

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    public function testTestingZendFormWithFileElementByUsingAMockTransferAdapter()
    {
        require_once "Zend/File/Transfer/Adapter/AbstractTest.php";
            
        $form = new ZF11197_TestForm();
        $form->getElement('file')->setTransferAdapter(
            new Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_AbstractTest_MockAdapter()
        );
            
        $this->assertTrue($form->isValid(array()));
    }
    


When added to the Zend\_Form\_FormTest test suite along with the following form class, this test will pass.

 
    <pre class="highlight">
    class ZF11197_TestForm extends Zend_Form
    {
        public function init()
        {
            $element = new Zend_Form_Element_File('file');
            $this->addElement($element);
        }
    }


An alternative would be to rip the code for Zend\_File\_Transfer\_Adapter\_AbstractTest\_MockAdapter out of the ZF testsuite and place it in your own application's test suite to remove that dependency on what is essentially a private class of the ZF testsuite.
