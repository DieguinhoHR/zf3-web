ZF-10063: Zend\_Validate\_Hostname\_Com with Zend\_Loader issue
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Issue Type: Bug Created: 2010-06-28T05:05:10.000+0000 Last Updated: 2010-06-30T04:02:52.000+0000 Status: Resolved Fix version(s): - 1.10.7 (28/Jul/10)

### Description

When using the Zend\_Loader for auto loading classes, it breaks if any of the classes in question try to include Zend\_Validate\_Hostname\_Com.

This is an obvious issue because the Loader is looking for a class, whereas Zend\_Validate\_Hostname\_Com just returns a resource (array). A class does not exist there.

**Fatal error**: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Exception' with message 'File "Zend/Validate/Hostname/Com.php" does not exist or class "Zend\_Validate\_Hostname\_Com" was not found in the file' in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Loader.php:88

Is there any way around this (other than not using Zend\_Loader - this is a must)?

Actually, this seems to be an issue even when not using the Loader...

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend\_Exception' with message 'File "Zend/Validate/Hostname/Com.php" does not exist or class "Zend\_Validate\_Hostname\_Com" was not found in the file' in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Loader.php:88 Stack trace: #0 /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Validate/Hostname.php(331): Zend\_Loader::loadClass('Zend\_Validate\_H...') #1 /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Uri/Http.php(448): Zend\_Validate\_Hostname->isValid('<www.google.com>') #2 /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Uri/Http.php(280): Zend\_Uri\_Http->validateHost() #3 /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Uri/Http.php(154): Zend\_Uri\_Http->valid() #4 /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Uri.php(132): Zend\_Uri\_Http->\_\_construct('http', '//<www.google.co>...') #5 /home/xil355/public\_html/eawp.com/oauther/oauth.php(13): Zend\_Uri::factory('<http://www.goog>...') #6 {main} thrown in /usr/local/lib/php/Zend/Loader.php on line 88

Even though, it's calling the loader anyways, for some odd reason...

The only thing included is Zend/Uri.php.

This can be closed - I just figured out the problem.

My include path was pointing to 2 different versions of Zend - the first one it looked at was the older, which was why it wasn't working.

I just removed the old Zend version and tada, it works.

Closing as non-issue
