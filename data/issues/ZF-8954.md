ZF-8954: Adding different mapping for native objects to the serializers of Zend\_Amf

### Description

Currently native ActionScript objects like Date and XML can't be mapped to other native objects like DateTime and SimpleXMLElement. In the current implementation this mapping is hard coded. Adding support for all the possible native PHP types makes the component more compatible with other libraries like for example Doctrine 2.
