Zend Framework 1.12.17 (2015-11-23)

- [638: Fixes null byte tests in `Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo`](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/pull/638)
- [632: Updates the TLD list for `Zend_Validate_Hostname` to version 2015102801.](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/pull/632)

### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2015-09**: `Zend_Captcha_Word` generates a "word" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this version, the selection was performed using PHP's internal `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due to its usage of `rand()` instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation. This release updates `Zend_Crypt_Math` to provide cryptographically secure RNG, and updates `Zend_Captcha_Word` to use these new facilities.
