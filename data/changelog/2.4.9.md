Zend Framework 2.4.9 (2015-11-23)

### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2015-09**: `Zend\Captcha\Word` generates a "word" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this vulnerability announcement, the selection was performed using PHP's internal `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due to its usage of `rand()` instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation. This release contains a patch that replaces the `array_rand()` calls to use `Zend\Math\Rand::getInteger()`, which provides better RNG.
- **ZF2015-10**: `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey` has a call to `openssl_public_encrypt()` which used PHP's default `$padding` argument, which specifies `OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING`, indicating usage of PKCS1v1.5 padding. This padding has a known vulnerability, the [Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12688/can-you-explain-bleichenbachers-cca-attack-on-pkcs1-v1-5), which can be used to recover an RSA private key. This release contains a patch that changes the padding argument to use `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.

  Users upgrading to this version may have issues decrypting previously stored values, due to the change in padding. If this occurs, you can pass the constant `OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING` to a new `$padding` argument in `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::encrypt()` and `decrypt()` (though typically this should only apply to the latter):

  ```php
  $decrypted = $rsa->decrypt($data, $key, $mode, OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING);
  ```

  where `$rsa` is an instance of `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa`.

  (The `$key` and `$mode` argument defaults are `null` and `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::MODE_AUTO`, if you were not using them previously.)
