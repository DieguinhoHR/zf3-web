Zend Framework 2.2.7 (2014-04-15)
====================

SECURITY FIXES
--------------

- **ZF2014-03:** Potential XSS vector in multiple view helpers due to
  inappropriate HTML attribute escaping. Many view helpers were using the
  `escapeHtml()` view helper in order to escape HTML attributes. This release
  patches them to use the `escapeHtmlAttr()` view helper in these situations.
  If you use form or navigation view helpers, or "HTML element" view helpers
  (such as `gravatar()`, `htmlFlash()`, `htmlPage()`, or `htmlQuicktime()`), we
  recommend upgrading immediately.
