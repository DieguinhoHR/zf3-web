Zend Framework 2.1.6 (2014-03-06)
====================

- **ZF2014-01:** Potential XXE/XEE attacks using PHP functions:
  `simplexml_load_*`, `DOMDocument::loadXML`, and `xml_parse`. A new component,
  `ZendXml`, was introduced to mitigate XML eXternal Entity and XML Entity
  Expansion vectors that are present in older versions of libxml2 and/or PHP.
  `Zend\Json\Json::fromXml()` and `Zend\XmlRpc`'s `Response` and `Fault` classes
  were potentially vulnerable to these attacks. If you use either of these
  components, we recommend upgrading immediately.
