Zend Framework 1.12.20 (2016-09-08)

## Security Updates

- **ZF2016-03:** The implementation of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` in
  `Zend_Db_Select` remained prone to SQL injection when a combination of SQL
  expressions and comments were used. This release provides a comprehensive
  solution that identifies and removes comments prior to checking validity of
  the statement to ensure no SQLi vectors occur. We advise always filtering
  user input prior to invoking these methods, however, to further protect your
  applications.
