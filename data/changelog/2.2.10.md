Zend Framework 2.2.10 (2015-02-17)

### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2015-02:** `Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\Postgresql` was incorrectly using
  `\\` to escape double quotes in identifiers and values, which could lead to
  SQL injection vectors. We have provided patches that use proper escaping. If
  you use Postgresql with Zend Framework 2, we recommend upgrading immediately.
