Zend Framework 2.4.11 (2016-12-20)

### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2016-04**: zend-mail contained a potential remote code execution vector
  via the Sendmail transport adapter when the local part of `From` addresses
  containing escape sequences were present. This release adds additional
  validation and filtering of these addresses to prevent the vulnerability.
