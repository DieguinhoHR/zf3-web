### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2015-07**: A number of components, including `Zend_Cloud`, `Zend_Search_Lucene`, and `Zend_Service_WindowsAzure` were creating directories with a liberal umask that could lead to local arbitrary code execution and/or local privilege escalation. This release contains a patch that ensures the directories are created using permissions of 0775 and files using 0664 (essentially umask 0002).
- **ZF2015-08**: ZF2014-06 uncovered an issue in the sqlsrv adapter provided by the framework whereby null bytes were not filtered correctly when generating SQL. A reporter discovered the same vulnerability is present in our PDO implementation when used with pdo_dblib, and could potentially be applied to other PDO adapters.  This release contains a patch to properly escape null bytes used in SQL queries across all PDO adapters shipped with the framework.
