Zend Framework 2.5.2 (2015-08-03)

### SECURITY UPDATES

- **ZF2015-06**: `ZendXml` runs a heuristic detection for XML Entity Expansion and XML eXternal Entity vectors when under php-fpm, due to issues with threading in libxml preventing using that library's built-in mechanisms for disabling them. However, the heuristic was determined to be faulty when multibyte encodings are used for the XML. This release contains a patch to ensure that the heuristic will work with multibyte encodings.

  If you use Zend Framework components that utilize DOMDocument or SimpleXML (which includes `Zend\XmlRpc`, `Zend\Soap`, `Zend\Feed`, and several others), and deploy using php-fpm in production (or plan to), we recommend upgrading immediately.
