ZF2015-09: Potential Information Disclosure and Insufficient Entropy vulnerability in Zend\\Captcha\\Word
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In Zend Framework, `Zend_Captcha_Word` (v1) and `Zend\Captcha\Word` (v2) generate a "word" for a CAPTCHA challenge by selecting a sequence of random letters from a character set. Prior to this advisory, the selection was performed using PHP's internal `array_rand()` function. This function does not generate sufficient entropy due to its usage of `rand()` instead of more cryptographically secure methods such as `openssl_pseudo_random_bytes()`. This could potentially lead to information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random number generation.

### Action Taken

 The code used to randomly select letters was updated as follows:

- In Zend Framework 1.12.17, the methods `randBytes()` and `randInteger()` were added to `Zend_Crypt_Math`. `Zend_Captcha_AbstractWord` was updated to use `Zend_Crypt_Math::randInteger()` instead of `array_rand()` when selecting letters for the CAPTCHA word.
- In the package zendframework/zend-captcha 2.4.9/2.5.2 and Zend Framework 2.4.9, `Zend\Captcha\AbstractWord` was updated to use `Zend\Math\Rand::getInteger()` instead of `array_rand()` when selecting letters for the CAPTCHA word.

 The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 1.12.17
- Zend Framework 2.4.9
- zend-captcha 2.4.9
- zend-captcha 2.5.2

### Recommendations

 This patch is considered a _security hardening_ patch, and as such, was not assigned a [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org) identifier.

 Regardless, if you use one of the word-based CAPTCHA adapters in Zend Framework 1 or 2, we recommend upgrading to 1.12.17, 2.4.9, or zend-captcha 2.4.9/2.5.2.
