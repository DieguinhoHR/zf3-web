ZF2010-04: Potential MIME-type Injection in Zend\_File\_Transfer
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Executive Summary

`Zend_File_Transfer` had a potential MIME type injection vulnerability for file uploads. In certain situations where either PHP's `ext/finfo` extension is not installed and the `mime_content_type()` function was not available on a system, `Zend_File_Transfer` would use the user provided value for the type embedded inside the `$_FILES` superglobal. Additionally, in cases where the functionality was available, but where a type could not be determined by one of them, `Zend_File_Transfer` would also fallback on the user provided type. Using user provided information for a file's MIME type in uploads is considered an insecure practice, as it provides attack vectors by malicious users.

### Action Taken

 This vulnerability has been fixed by returning "application/octet" in situations where the MIME type cannot be detected securely by PHP.

### Recommendations

 If you use this component, or other components that rely on it (e.g., `Zend_Form_Element_File`), we strongly recommend upgrading to the most current version of Zend Framework available, or one of the following versions.

- 1.9.7
- 1.8.5
