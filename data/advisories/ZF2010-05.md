# ZF2010-05: Potential XSS vector in Zend\_Service\_ReCaptcha\_MailHide

## Executive Summary

`Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide` had a potential XSS vulnerability. Due to the
fact that the email address was never validated, and because its use of
`htmlentities()` did not include the encoding argument, it was potentially
possible for a malicious user aware of the issue to inject a specially crafted
multibyte string as an attack via the CAPTCHA's email argument.

## Action Taken

An `EmailAddress` validator was added by default to
`Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide` (which may be replaced with any
`Zend_Validate_interface` implementation), and the submitted email address is
now passed through this validator prior to performing any markup generation.
Additionally, accessors for setting and retrieving the encoding to use with
`htmlentities()` have been provided, with a default value of UTF-8 used.

## Recommendations

If you use `Zend_Service_ReCaptcha_MailHide`, it is strongly recommended that
you upgrade to either the latest available Zend Framework release, or one of the
following releases, immediately:

- 1.9.7
- 1.8.5
- 1.7.9
