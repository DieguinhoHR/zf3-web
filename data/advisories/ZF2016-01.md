# ZF2016-01: Potential Insufficient Entropy Vulnerability in ZF1

We discovered several methods used to generate random numbers in ZF1 that
potentially used insufficient entropy. These random number generators are used
in the following method calls:

- `Zend_Ldap_Attribute::createPassword`
- `Zend_Form_Element_Hash::_generateHash`
- `Zend_Gdata_HttpClient::filterHttpRequest`
- `Zend_Filter_Encrypt_Mcrypt::_srand`
- `Zend_OpenId::randomBytes`

In each case, the methods were using `rand()` or `mt_rand()`, neither of which
can generate cryptographically secure values. This could potentially lead to
information disclosure should an attacker be able to brute force the random
number generation.

Moreover, we discovered a potential security issue in the usage of the
[openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-random-pseudo-bytes.php)
function in `Zend_Crypt_Math::randBytes`, reported in PHP BUG
[#70014](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70014), and the security implications
reported in a discussion [on the random_compat library](https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/issues/96).

## Action Taken

We replaced the usage of `rand()` and `mt_rand()` with the random generators of
ZF1 implemented in [Zend_Crypt_Math()](https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/blob/master/library/Zend/Crypt/Math.php).

Moreover, we removed the usage of `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` functions in
`Zend_Crypt_Math::randBytes()`. This removal is not a BC break for Linux users
thanks to the usage of `/dev/urandom` as an entropy source. For Windows users,
this can be a BC break if the Mcrypt extension is not enabled.

The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 1.12.18

## Recommendations

If you are using an affected version of PHP, we highly recommend upgrading
immediately to Zend Framework 1.12.18.

## Other Information

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

- Brian Engert of [Soliant Consulting](http://www.soliantconsulting.com/), who
  discovered, reported, and proposed a patch for the issue;
- [Enrico Zimuel](http://zimuel.it),  who tested the patch and added the patch
  for the OpenSSL usage removal.
