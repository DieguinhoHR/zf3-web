# ZF2010-02: Potential XSS vector in Zend\_Dojo\_View\_Helper\_Editor

## Executive Summary

`Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor` was incorrectly decorating a TEXTAREA instead of
a DIV. The Dojo team has reported that this has security implications as the
rich text editor they use is unable to escape content for a TEXTAREA.

## Action Taken

The primary rationale in Zend Framework for using a TEXTAREA with the Editor
Dijit was to allow for graceful degradation in browser environments that do not
support JavaScript. The component has been reworked such that we now decorate an
HTML DIV, and provide a separate TEXTAREA within a NOSCRIPT tag for purposes of
graceful degradation; content is escaped in the latter TEXTAREA.

## Recommendations

If you use `Zend_Dojo_View_Helper_Editor`, it is strongly recommended that you
upgrade to either the latest available Zend Framework release, or one of the
following releases, immediately:

- 1.9.7
- 1.8.5
- 1.7.9
