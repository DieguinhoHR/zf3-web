AG2015-01: Potential Authenticated User Spoofing in zf-oauth2
-------------------------------------------------------------

 We discovered a potential issue in the Web-Server Application scenario (also termed "Authorization Code") of [zf-oauth2](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-oauth2). An attacker can pass a `user_id` value in the query string when using the scenario, and associate the authorization code and the token to a different user. Passing the `user_id` in the query string is a bad practice; the user identity should be managed server side using a value from original authorization (e.g. from the original login page).

 The vulnerability exists in all stable versions of zf-oauth2 from 1.1.0 forward. Only applications using the `authorization_code` scenario are affected.

### Action Taken

 We removed the ability to specify the `user_id` in the query string when utilizing the `/authorize` resource, and we now use `Zend\Authorization\AuthorizationService` as the default mechanism for managing the identity of the user under this OAuth2 scenario.

 The patch fixing the issues has been applied in the following versions:

- zf-oauth2 1.2.1
- zf-oauth2 1.3.1

 Additionally, we have released corresponding versions of the Apigility skeleton, used by our installer, to ensure they use these versions of zf-oauth2 by default.

### Recommendations

 If you are using `zf-oauth2` with the web application/authorization code scenario, we recommend upgrading zf-oauth2 to either 1.2.1 or 1.3.1. This can usually be done using `composer update zfcampus/zf-oauth2`.
