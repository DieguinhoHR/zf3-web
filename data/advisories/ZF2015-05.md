ZF2015-05: Potential XSS and Open Redirect vectors in zend-diactoros
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Drupal Security Team notified us of a potential issue with the [Diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) URI implementation. Diactoros is a [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) implementation of HTTP messages.

 If the path from a `Zend\Diactoros\Uri` instance is used to generate links, form targets, or headers, and omits the scheme and authority, a potential XSS and/or open redirect vector is possible if the path starts with double slashes and a path segment that validates as a hostname; in such a situation, it may be interpreted as a scheme-relative link.

 The vulnerability exists in all stable versions of zend-diactoros prior to 1.0.4.

### Action Taken

`Zend\Diactoros\Uri::filterPath()`` was updated to ensure that the returned path will never begin with double slashes. Tests were also added to prevent a regression in the future.

 The patch fixing the issues has been applied in the following versions:

- zend-diactoros 1.0.4

 This vulnerability has also been disclosed as [CVE-2015-3257](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3257).

### Recommendations

 If you are using `Zend\Diactoros\Uri` to generate links, form targets, or headers without including the scheme and authority, we recommend:

- Upgrading immediately to zend-diactoros 1.0.4.
- Consider altering your code to generate absolute URIs (which can be done by simply casting the `Uri` instance to a string).
