ZF2010-06: Potential XSS or HTML Injection vector in Zend\_Json
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Executive Summary

`Zend_Json_Encoder` was not taking into account the solidus character ("/") during encoding, leading to incompatibilities with the JSON specification, and opening the potential for XSS or HTML injection attacks when returning HTML within a JSON string.

### Action Taken

`Zend_Json_Encoder` was patched to escape the solidus character when encoding PHP strings to JSON.

### Recommendations

 This particular vulnerability only affects those users who are either (a) using `Zend_Json_Encoder` directly, (b) requesting native encoding instead of usage of ext/json (e.g., by enabling the static `$useBuiltinEncoderDecoder` property of `Zend_Json`), or (c) on systems where ext/json is unavailable (e.g. RHEL, CentOS). If you are affected, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest available Zend Framework release, or one of the following releases, immediately.

- 1.9.7
- 1.8.5
- 1.7.9
