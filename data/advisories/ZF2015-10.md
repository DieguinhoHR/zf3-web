ZF2015-10: Potential Information Disclosure in Zend\\Crypt\\PublicKey\\Rsa\\PublicKey
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey` has a call to `openssl_public_encrypt()` which uses PHP's default `$padding` argument, which specifies `OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING`, indicating usage of PKCS1v1.5 padding. This padding has a known vulnerability, the [Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12688/can-you-explain-bleichenbachers-cca-attack-on-pkcs1-v1-5), which can be used to decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts.

### Action Taken

- `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey::encrypt()` was updated to accept an additional argument, `$padding`; the default value for this argument was set to `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.
- `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PrivateKey::decrypt()` was updated to accept an additional argument, `$padding`; the default value for this argument was set to `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.
- `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::encrypt()` was updated to accept an additional optional argument, `$padding`, allowing the user to specify the padding to use with `PublicKey::encrypt()`.
- `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::decrypt()` was updated to accept an additional optional argument, `$padding`, allowing the user to specify the padding to use with `PrivateKey::decrypt()`.

 The above changes represent a backwards-compatibility break, but were necessary to prevent the outlined vulnerability. If you were using `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa` previously, you will likely need to re-encrypt any data you've previously encrypted to use the new padding. This can be done as follows:

 
    $decrypted = $rsa->decrypt($data, $key, $rsa::MODE_AUTO, OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING);
    $encrypted = $rsa->encrypt($data, $key); // Encrypted using OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING


 The key may have a value of `null` in each of the examples above.

 The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 2.4.9
- zend-framework/zend-crypt 2.4.9
- zend-framework/zend-crypt 2.5.2

 This advisory was given the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2015-7503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7503)

### Recommendations

 If you use zend-crypt via either Zend Framework 2 or the zendframework/zend-crypt package, and are using the RSA public key functionality, we recommend upgrading to 2.4.9/2.5.2 immediately.

### Acknowledgments
