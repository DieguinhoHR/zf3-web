ZF2012-05: Potential XML eXternal Entity injection vectors in Zend Framework 1 Zend\_Feed component
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Zend_Feed_Rss` and `Zend_Feed_Atom` were found to contain potential XML eXternal Entity (XXE) vectors due to insecure usage of PHP's DOM extension. External entities could be specified by adding a specific DOCTYPE element to feeds; exploiting this vulnerability could coerce opening arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.

 A similar issue was fixed for 1.11.13 and 1.12.0, in the `Zend_Feed::import()` factory method; however, the reporter of the issue discovered that the individual classes contained similar functionality in their constructors which remained vulnerable.

### Action Taken

 A patch was applied that removes the XXE vector by calling `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` before attempting to parse the feed via `DOMDocument::loadXML()`.

### Recommendations

 If you are using any of the components listed, and, in particular, were directly instantiating them, we recommend upgrading to either version 1.11.15 or 1.12.1 or greater.
