# ZF2013-04: Potential Remote Address Spoofing Vector in Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\RemoteAddress

The `Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress` class provides features around
detecting the internet protocol (IP) address for an incoming proxied request via
the `X-Forwarded-For` header, taking into account a provided list of trusted
proxy server IPs. Prior to 2.2.5, the class was not taking into account whether
or not the IP address contained in PHP's `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` was in the
trusted proxy server list.

The [IETF draft specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-http-forwarded-10)
indicates that if `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` is not a trusted proxy, it must be
considered the originating IP address, and the value of `X-Forwarded-For` must
be disregarded.

## Action Taken

We have made the following change to the `Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress` class:

- If we detect that (a) we will test against proxy servers, and (b)
  `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` is not in the list of trusted proxy servers, we now
  return the value of `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` immediately, without
  introspecting the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## Recommendations

You are only affected by this as an issue if you directly consume one of the
following in your code:

- `Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\RemoteAddress`
- `Zend\Session\Validator\RemoteAddr`

If you do, we recommend immediately upgrading to version 2.2.5.
