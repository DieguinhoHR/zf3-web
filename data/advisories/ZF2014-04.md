ZF2014-04: Potential SQL injection in the ORDER implementation of Zend\_Db\_Select
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The implementation of the `ORDER BY` SQL statement in `Zend_Db_Select` of Zend Framework 1 contains a potential SQL injection when the query string passed contains parentheses.

 For instance, the following code is affected by this issue:

    $db     = Zend_Db::factory( /* options here */ );
    $select = $db->select()
                 ->from(array('p' => 'products'))
                 ->order('MD5(1); drop table products');
    echo $select;


 This code produce the string:

    SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY MD5(1);drop table products ASC


 instead of the correct one:


    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY "MD5(1);drop table products" ASC


 The SQL injection occurs because we create a new `Zend_Db_Expr()` object, in presence of parentheses, passing directly the value without any filter on the string.

### Action Taken

 We fixed the issue in the `Zend_Db_Select::order()` function using a more granular regular expression to match only SQL functions in an `ORDER BY` statement, such as     ORDER BY
        ABS("zfproducts"."product_id")
.

 The new regular expression is `'/^[\w]*\(.*\)$/'` instead of the previous `'/\(.*\)/'`.  This change fixes the issue, filtering the input using quotes for the previous attack.

 The previous SQL example with the fix is rendered in the correct way:


    <pre class="highlight">
    SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY "MD5(1);drop table products" ASC


 **The patch is available starting in Zend Framework 1.12.7.**

Other Information
-----------------

 This SQL injection attack does not affect Zend Framework 2 versions because the implementation of `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::order()` does not manage parenthetical expressions.
