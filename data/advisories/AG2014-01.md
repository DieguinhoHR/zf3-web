# AG2014-01: Potential Database Injection Vector in DB-Connected REST Services

[zf-apigility](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility) contains a class,
`ZF\Apigility\DbConnectedResource`, used by all DB-Connected REST services for
prototyping web services that write to a database table, or for simple
CRUD-style web services.

This class was correctly pulling data from the composed input filter, if any,
for `create()` operations. However, it was not doing so for `update()` and
`patch()` operations, leading to the potential for unfiltered data to make its
way to the database.

Note, however, that this is not a SQL injection vulnerability, as database
updates were still using the underlying database abstraction layer. However, in
cases where values are expected to be normalized, unfiltered versions could
enter the database; additionally, if any data not matching existing database
columns were provided, database errors could occur.

### Action Taken

Each of the `create()`, `update()`, and `patch()` operations in the
`ZF\Apigility\DbConnectedResource` class were updated to always pull data from
the composed input filter when present.

The following releases contain the fixes:

- zf-apigility 1.0.2
- Apigility (zf-apigility-skeleton) 1.0.3
