# ZF2015-08: Potential SQL injection vector using null byte for PDO (MsSql, SQLite)

The PDO adapters of Zend Framework 1 do not filter null bytes values in SQL
statements. A PDO adapter can treat null bytes in a query as a string
terminator, allowing an attacker to add arbitrary SQL following a null byte, and
thus create a SQL injection.

We tested and verified the null byte injection using `pdo_dblib` (FreeTDS) on a
Linux environment to access a remote Microsoft SQL Server, and also tested
against and noted the vector against `pdo_sqlite`.

## Action Taken

We added null byte filtering in the PDO abstract component
`Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Abstract`. We decided to use the abstract component to
prevent null byte injection in all the PDO adapters once we discovered the
situation was not specific to `pdo_dblib`.

We used the PHP's addcslashes to sanitize and properly quote null bytes:

```php
$value = addcslashes($value, "\000\032");
```

The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 1.12.16

## Recommendations

If you use one of the PDO-based adapters in Zend Framework 1, we recommend
upgrading to 1.12.16 immediately.

## Other Information

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

- Chris Kings-Lynne, who discovered and reported the issue against the
  `Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mssql` component of ZF1;
- [Enrico Zimuel](http://zimuel.it), who provided the patch.
