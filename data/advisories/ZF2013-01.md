ZF2013-01: Route Parameter Injection Via Query String in Zend\\Mvc
------------------------------------------------------------------

 In Zend Framework 2, `Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\Query` is used primarily to allow appending query strings to URLs when assembled. However, due to the fact that it captures any query parameters into the `RouteMatch`, and the fact that `RouteMatch` parameters are merged with any parent routes, this can lead to overriding already captured routing parameters, bypassing constraints defined in the parents.

 As an example, consider the following route definition:

    array(
        'user' => array(
            'type' => 'segment',
            'options' => array(
                'route' => '/user/:key',
                'defaults' => array(
                    'controller' => 'UserController',
                    'action'     => 'show-action',
                ),
                'constraints' => array(
                    'key' => '[a-z0-9]+',
                ),
            ),
            'child_routes' => array(
                'query' => array('type' => 'query'),
            ),
        ),
    )


 If the request URI was `/user/foo/?controller=SecretController&key=invalid_value`, the `RouteMatch` returned after routing would contain the following:


    <pre class="highlight">
    array(
        'controller' => 'SecretController',
        'action'     => 'show-action',
        'key'        => 'invalid_value',
    )


 This would lead to execution of a different controller than intended, with a value for the `key` parameter that bypassed the constraints outlined in the parent route.

### Action Taken

 Zend Framework 2.1 introduced changes to the router implementation that now allows passing both query string values and fragment values during URI assembly, effectively obsoleting the original use case of the `Query` route. As an example, you can now do the following:


    <pre class="highlight">
    $url = $router->assemble(array(
        'name' => 'foo',
    ), array(
        'query' => array(
            'page' => 3,
            'sort' => 'DESC',
        ),
        // or: 'query' => 'page=3&sort=DESC'
    ));

    // via URL helper/plugin:
    $rendererOrController->url('foo', array(), array('query' => $request->getQuery()));


 As such, for versions 2.0.8 and 2.1.4, we have marked `Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\Query` deprecated. Additionally, we have modified the code in its `match()` method to no longer pass the query parameters to the `RouteMatch`, eliminating the possibility of route parameter injection entirely.

### Recommendations

 If you are using the `Query` route in Zend Framework 2, we recommend upgrading to Zend Framework 2.0.8 or 2.1.4 immediately.
