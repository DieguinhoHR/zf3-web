# ZF2012-02: Denial of Service vector via XEE injection

`Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, `Zend_Soap`, and `Zend_XmlRpc` are vulnerable to XML
Entity Expansion (XEE) vectors, leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE
attacks occur when the XML DOCTYPE declaration includes XML entity definitions
that contain either recursive or circular references; this leads to CPU and
memory consumption, making Denial of Service exploits trivial to implement.

## Action Taken

All locations where `SimpleXML` or `DOMDocument` were used with user input were
patched. The patches mitigate the XEE vector by first calling
`libxml_disable_entity_loader()`, and then looping through the `DOMDocument`
children, testing if any are of type `XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE`; if so, an
exception is raised and execution is halted.

Where `SimpleXML` is used, the XML is loaded first via `DOMDocument` and scanned
as noted above; once validated, the `DOMDocument` instance is passed to
`simplexml_import_dom()`.

This patch has been applied starting in versions 1.11.13 and 1.12.0 of Zend
Framework, and has been ported to the upcoming version 2.0.0 development branch
(and first released with 2.0.0rc4).

## Recommendations

If you are using either `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, `Zend_Soap` or `Zend_XmlRpc` in
your projects, we recommend **immediately** upgrading to 1.11.13 or greater.
