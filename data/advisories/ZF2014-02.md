# ZF2014-02: Potential security issue in login mechanism of ZendOpenId and Zend\_OpenId consumer

Using the `Consumer` component of `ZendOpenId` (or `Zend_OpenId` in ZF1), it is
possible to login using an arbitrary OpenID account (without knowing any secret
information) by using a malicious OpenID Provider. That means OpenID it is
possible to login using arbitrary OpenID Identity (MyOpenID, Google, etc), which
are not under the control of our own OpenID Provider. Thus, we are able to
impersonate any OpenID Identity against the framework.

Moreover, the Consumer accepts OpenID tokens with arbitrary signed elements. The
framework does not check if, for example, both `openid.claimed_id` and
`openid.endpoint_url` are signed. It is just sufficient to sign one parameter.
According to [https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2\_0.html#positive\_assertions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#positive_assertions),
at least `op_endpoint`, `return_to`, `response_nonce`, `assoc_handle`, and, if
present in the response, `claimed_id` and `identity`, must be signed.

## How the attack works

To realize the attack, we set up a malicious OpenID Provider (e.g.
`http://openid.evil.com`) that is able to generate valid OpenID tokens
containing arbitrary `openid.identifier` and `openid.claimed_id` values. At that
point, we can successfully authenticate with the issued identity controlled by
our Identity Provider, e.g. `http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`. This confirms
that our Identity Provider works correctly. Then we log out. Afterwards, we
start the same login procedure, i.e. we submit the same Identity again
(`http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`). According to the OpenID specification,
we are redirected to our Identity Provider (`http://openid.evil.com`). But this
time, we configure our Identity Provider to ignore the requested identity
(`http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`) and instead use a victim's identity
(e.g. `openid.claimed_id=http://victim.myopenid.com/`,
`openid.identity=http://victim.myopenid.com/`, and additionally
`op_endpoint=http://www.myopenid.com/server`).

All other `openid.*` parameters are used as requested. Note that our Identity
Provider is not authorized to issue tokens in the name of other Identity
Providers (such as MyOpenID, Google, etc.). However, the token is accepted by
the framework. In this manner we could impersonate other users/identities
without knowing any credentials and secrets.

## Action Taken

We have made the following changes to `ZendOpenId\Consumer\GenericConsumer` and
`Zend_OpenId_Consumer` classes:

- During the `verify()` method of the consumer, if the `openid_op_endpoint`
  value is different from the previous server, related to the same
  `openid_assoc_handle`, we return `false`, reporting an error.
- Before the signature validation of the `openid_sig` parameter, we check that
- the required parameters (as noted in the [assertion section of the OpenID specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#positive_assertions))
  are all present in the `openid_signed` list.

The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.4
- ZendOpenId, version 2.0.2
