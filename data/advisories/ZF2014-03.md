ZF2014-03: Potential XSS vector in multiple view helpers
--------------------------------------------------------

 Many Zend Framework 2 view helpers were using the escapeHtml() view helper in order to escape HTML attributes, instead of the more appropriate escapeHtmlAttr(). In situations where user data and/or JavaScript is used to seed attributes, this can lead to potential cross site scripting (XSS) attack vectors.

 Vulnerable view helpers include:

- All Zend\\Form view helpers.
- Most Zend\\Navigation (aka Zend\\View\\Helper\\Navigation\\\*) view helpers.
- All "HTML Element" view helpers: htmlFlash(), htmlPage(), htmlQuickTime().
- Zend\\View\\Helper\\Gravatar

### Action Taken

 All view helpers affected have been updated to use the escapeHtmlAttr() view helper when escaping data for HTML attributes.

 The following releases contain the fixes:

- Zend Framework 2.2.7
- Zend Framework 2.3.1
