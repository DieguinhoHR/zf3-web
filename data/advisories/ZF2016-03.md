# ZF2016-03: Potential SQL injection in ORDER and GROUP functions of ZF1

The implementation of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` in `Zend_Db_Select` remained
prone to SQL injection when a combination of SQL expressions and comments were
used. This security patch provides a comprehensive solution that identifies and
removes comments prior to checking validity of the statement to ensure no SQLi
vectors occur.

The implementation of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` in `Zend_Db_Select` of ZF1 is
vulnerable by the following SQL injection:

```php
$db = Zend_Db::factory(/* options here */);
$select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);
$select->from('p');
$select->order("MD5(\"a(\");DELETE FROM p2; #)"); // same with group()
```

The above `$select` will render the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT `p`.* FROM `p` ORDER BY MD5("a(");DELETE FROM p2; #) ASC
```

instead of the correct one:

```sql
SELECT "p".* FROM "p" ORDER BY "MD5(""a("");DELETE FROM p2; #)" ASC
```

This security fix can be considered an improvement of the previous
[ZF2016-02](/security/advisory/ZF2016-02) and
[ZF2014-04](/security/advisory/ZF2014-04) advisories.

As a final consideration, we recommend developers either never use user input
for these operations, or filter user input thoroughly prior to invoking
`Zend_Db`.  You can use the `Zend_Db_Select::quoteInto()` method to filter the
input data, as shown in this example:

```php
$db    = Zend_Db::factory(...);
$input = "MD5(\"a(\");DELETE FROM p2; #)"; // user input can be an attack
$order = $db->quoteInto("SQL statement for ORDER", $input);

$select = new Zend_Db_Select($db);
$select->from('p');
$select->order($order); // same with group()
```

## Action Taken

We fixed the reported SQL injection by removing comments from the SQL statement
before passing it to either the `order()` or `group()` methods; this patch
effectively solves any comment-based SQLi vectors.

We used the following regex to remove comments from a SQL statement:

```php
const REGEX_SQL_COMMENTS = '@
    (([\'"]).*?[^\\\]\2) # $1 : Skip single & double quoted expressions
    |(                   # $3 : Match comments
        (?:\#|--).*?$    # - Single line comments
        |                # - Multi line (nested) comments
         /\*             #   . comment open marker
            (?: [^/*]    #   . non comment-marker characters
                |/(?!\*) #   . ! not a comment open
                |\*(?!/) #   . ! not a comment close
                |(?R)    #   . recursive case
            )*           #   . repeat eventually
        \*\/             #   . comment close marker
    )\s*                 # Trim after comments
    |(?<=;)\s+           # Trim after semi-colon
    @msx';
```

**The patch is available starting in Zend Framework 1.12.20.**

## Other Information

This SQL injection attack does not affect Zend Framework 2 and 3 versions because the
implementations of `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::order()` and `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::group()` do
not manage parenthetical expressions.
